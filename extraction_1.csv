0,Lyft to make ‘significant’ cuts across ride-hailing company,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 21, 2023","Lyft’s newly appointed CEO David Risher told employees in an email Friday that the company is significantly reducing its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. Risher said the restructuring is part of Lyft’s plan to “better meeting the needs of riders and drivers.” The company confirmed that it has not changed its guidance for the first quarter in spite of the upcoming layoffs. What’s less clear is how this might affect programs outside of ride-hailing such as its bike-sharing service. Lyft doesn’t employ drivers who use the ride-hailing app to pick up and drop off riders. Instead, the layoffs will be directed at the company’s more than 4,000 full-time employees. Employees will learn whether they have a job or not via an email that will be sent out April 27. Lyft wouldn’t disclose the number of people who will be cut. A WSJ report, citing unnamed sources, said about 1,200 workers, 30% of its total workforce, would be affected. Risher, a former retail executive at Amazon, took over the CEO position at Lyft after co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer stepped down last month. Risher explained in the email that he made the decision to help the company achieve its two core purposes. “Lyft has two purposes that are linked to each other: We help riders get out and about so they can live their lives together, and we provide drivers a way to work that gives them control over their time and money,” he wrote. The move may come as no surprise to those who closely follow Lyft and its struggles to keep apace of rival Uber. Risher told TechCrunch in a late March interview that Lyft might drop its shared rides offering and make other changes to its business model in a bid to focus on its core ride-hailing business and become profitable. He listed a number of other products and services that could disappear, including Wait & Save, which allows riders in certain regions to pay a lower fare if they wait for the best-located driver. “It’s possible that maybe we don’t need both of those anymore and that we can focus all our resources on doing a fewer number of things better,” Risher told TechCrunch at the time. “Maybe it’s time for us to say the shared rides were great for a time, but it’s time to let that go."
1,"Roku gains 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1, warns of continued ad uncertainty",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 26, 2023","Roku delivered its first-quarter results on Wednesday with better-than-expected revenue and the addition of 1.6 million active streaming accounts in the period. Although the company’s results came in above analyst estimates, Roku told investors that it sees its advertising business remaining challenged. The company’s revenue for the quarter reached $741 million, up just 1% from the year-ago quarter, and a net loss of $193.6 million. Notably, the company revealed that it reached 71.6 million active accounts, a 17% year-over-year increase. Streaming hours reached 25.1 billion, up 4.2 billion hours or 20% year-over-year. Average revenue per user fell 5% year-over-year to $40.67. “Similar to our viewpoint during our last earnings call, we expect macro uncertainties to persist throughout 2023,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders. “Consumers remain pressured by inflation and recessionary fears, and thus discretionary spend is likely to remain muted. Accordingly, we expect the advertising market in Q2 to look much the same as it did in Q1, with ad spend from certain verticals improving (travel and health and wellness), while others remain pressured (M&E and financial services).” In its letter, Roku wrote that it was the most popular streaming platform for this year’s Super Bowl with approximately half of all streams. The company notes that of those viewers, 12% started the game through either its Sports experience or a game-related ad. Roku expects Q2 total net revenue of about $770 million, total gross profit of roughly $335 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $75 million. The company’s earning results come a month after Roku conducted a second round of layoffs and let go of 6% of its workforce, or around 200 employees. Roku disclosed the cuts in an SEC filing, explaining that the decision was part of a larger plan to lower its year-over-year operating expense growth and prioritize projects that it believes will have a higher return on investment. The company had laid off 200 U.S. employees back in November, citing economic conditions in the industry.    "
2,Lookout sells its consumer cybersecurity business to F-Secure for $223M and goes all-in on the enterprise,['@psawers'],"April 26, 2023","Lookout’s long-running transition to becoming an enterprise security company is all but complete, revealing today that it’s selling its consumer mobile security business to Finland’s F-Secure in a deal valued at around $223 million. Founded out of San Francisco in 2009, Lookout originally started as a consumer-focused smartphone security and data backup business, garnering millions of users and hundreds of millions in funding from esteemed investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, Greylock, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Telekom and Jeff Bezos. Over the past 10 years, Lookout has gradually extended its reach into the business realm, notching up enterprise partnerships with technology giants such as Samsung along the way. A couple of years back, Lookout went most of the way toward cementing its B2B credentials when it snapped up cloud-native cybersecurity startup CipherCloud, a company focused on the growing secure access service edge (SASE) security segment. Fast-forward to today, and while Lookout still offers a suite of security products for the consumer market, including antivirus software for smartphones, it’s clear that its trajectory in recent years has been heading much closer to the enterprise, which is why it’s offloading pretty much all of the remnants of its consumer business to F-Secure — a long-established European consumer cybersecurity company that sells everything from password management tools to antivirus applications. Lookout says that with this transaction, which it expects to conclude within the next two months, its business will “now evolve into a pure-play enterprise company,” focusing on cloud and mobile endpoint security. The company said that the proceeds from the sale will be be plowed back into its enterprise products, alongside the $150 million in debt-financing it secured from BlackRock last summer. “Our success in the highly competitive enterprise market has compelled us to focus our product and go-to-market efforts to gain advantage,” Lookout CEO Jim Dolce noted in a press release. “By doubling down on the enterprise market, we’ll be better positioned to capitalize on its projected hypergrowth, fueled by an increase in remote and hybrid work, a shift to cloud-based delivery models and the transition to zero-trust architectures.” For F-Secure, the deal gives it a stronger foothold in the U.S. market specifically, as well as bolstering its existing consumer software lineup with a suite of fairly similar products. “In line with F-Secure strategy, we are seeking growth both organically and through acquisitions,” F-Secure CEO Timo Laaksonen said in a statement. “The acquisition of Lookout consumer business unit is a significant step in developing our business in the United States. With a complementary software product portfolio and strong competence in developing mobile products, Lookout consumer business unit is a perfect fit for F-Secure.” *This article was updated with a deal valuation and additional comment from F-Secure."
3,Bend is taking on Brex and Ramp with a green twist and a $2.5M seed round,"['Tim De Chant', 'Alex Wilhelm']","May 3, 2023","When the SEC announced that it planned to require companies under its purview to disclose their climate-related risks and emissions, plenty of companies started publicly clutching their pearls. Tracking down the extent of their pollution would simply be either too expensive, too difficult or both, they said. No surprise there: Companies strike a similar tone every time a new regulation is proposed. The reality is that the requirement likely won’t be nearly as difficult as they claim, but what if tracking some of their most challenging emissions were as simple as swapping out their corporate spend cards? “For most companies, 75% to 80% of their emissions typically are Scope 3 emissions, which is all the goods and services that they’re buying,” said Ted Power, co-founder and CEO of Bend. “And so what that means is that the best way for companies to reduce their missions is to address all of those goods and services they’re buying.” Power and co-founder Thomas Moore started Bend to help companies tackle their Scope 3 emissions. The startup began by selling access to its API for carbon accounting, but the team soon shifted focus to the corporate spend market. “The thesis is that by making it free and embedding it in a corporate card, there’s a much bigger addressable market, and we can engage more folks in what is essentially the same thing under the hood in terms of the carbon accounting,” Power said. Like many other credit cards, Bend offers rewards, though not the usual cash back or points-based fare. Instead, it offers carbon offsets. The company is announcing a $2.5 million seed round, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. Since it’s a small team, the company has piggybacked on a selection of projects from Frontier, the advanced market commitment created by Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify and others. Carbon credits are transacted through Patch, the carbon market. That offers a few advantages compared with a DIY approach. For one, Patch has a relatively large market of vetted projects. And two, it offers a sort of insurance: If one of the projects goes bust or doesn’t deliver on its promises, buyers can swap credits for new ones. Bend only buys those that cost at least $100 per metric ton. “It’s investing in these very scalable carbon very sort of scientifically based carbon removal projects that, if successful, will come down the cost curve,” Power said. Bend’s current roster of projects includes CarbonCapture, Charm Industrial and Living Carbon. The first two are different approaches to carbon capture and storage, while the latter uses engineered trees that grow faster and in theory sequester more carbon (experts have raised questions about whether they really do, however). That lineup may change, of course. “Ultimately, our goal is to support the best projects,” Power said. TechCrunch+ has covered the corporate spend market exhaustively in recent years due to a hotbed of startup activity. Brex, Ramp and Airbase, among the better-known, yet-private unicorns competing from the U.S. market, have raised more than $3 billion in combined capital while private, according to Crunchbase data.

In practice, however, sales development representatives (SDRs) do most of the work required to land new customers, “making cold calls, writing email outreach, or sending outbound mail,” says GTM strategist Mike Tong. Because it takes “about 15 touches for a prospect to want to see a demo,” Tong authored a TC+ guide for CEOs who need guidance around hiring and incentivizing SDR teams. “Pipeline generation at early-stage companies is expensive and time consuming, often more so than the sales process itself.

6,Now is the time to invest in Black-owned banks,['@dominicmadori'],"March 23, 2023","In the past two weeks, millions of dollars shuffled from startup and investor bank accounts housed in the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank to the JPMorgans, Brexes and Wises of the world. As founders and investors continue looking for new places to park their money, it’s essential to consider this moment as an opportunity to start banking with some of the few Black-owned banks. Digitally, there is Intrepid, co-founded by Collin Thompson, which works exclusively with businesses and global remote teams. Thompson told TechCrunch+ that his company’s goal is to become a trusted partner to founders, especially those affected by the SVB collapse. Intrepid offers similar services to Brex, in addition to more specialized assistance, such as all-in-one HR tools. In the wake of SVB’s crash, Intrepid has implemented services like higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance and sweep accounts. To create insurance beyond the typical $250,000 backed by the FDIC, Thompson said he’s building a new deposit network product with his banking partners, allowing his company to create multiple deposit accounts within the FDIC-insured limit and letting customers access those accounts through a single application. Intrepid also provides social resources, such as introductions and events, for those looking to grow their business networks. “Given our diverse backgrounds, this informs how we manage risk, what types of customers we take on and how we serve,” Thompson said. “Our interests, experiences and character guide us, and this will impact the types of customers we attract. We believe that every customer, regardless of their background or identity, deserves to have a financial partner they can trust and rely on, and we are here to provide that.” There are also brick-and-mortar Black banks, such as Unity National Bank, currently the only Black-owned bank in the state of Texas, which has a branch in Atlanta; Liberty Bank, which has branches in nine states, including Louisiana; and OneUnited, which is based in Massachusetts with branches in Los Angeles, Miami and Boston. Many Black-owned brick-and-mortar banks are based in the U.S. South, which aligns with the latest venture migration pattern to states such as Georgia, Texas and Florida. Though these banks do not have many branches, they could still be important when considering financial diversification. "

8,4 SaaS engagement metrics that attract investors,[],"April 14, 2023","Investors wish they could forecast the future and decrease the uncertainty regarding how a business will grow. Subscribers’ retention on the annual plan is directly related to the product value. However, it comes with a significant lag, e.g., an annual plan is only observable a year after the customer signed up. So, the best predictors for resubscription are the current engagement rates of your existing subscribers. Let’s see what engagement metrics gain the most significant interest from investors. There are many engagement metrics to look at. What matters most is how your subscribers engage with the core app functionality over longer periods, specifically closer to the end of their subscription. If they are using it actively, this signals they are getting the expected (or hopefully even beyond expected) value from the product, increasing the probability of their renewing for another year. The obvious metric to review is how often your user opens the app toward the end of the period in question. To find customer retention data points that have strong investor appeal, start studying these engagement stats from your existing users. For a more in-depth analysis, look at the usage of the core app functionality during these periods. Cohort engagement analysis comes in handy here; you can see what share of users who started using your application 12 months ago are still opening it and using the core functionality three, six, nine, and 12 months after the first use. When you see, for example, a 60% churn rate in the third month after installing it, the cohort obviously will not have a high chance of getting more than 40% of its customers to resubscribe in nine months because they are highly likely to have canceled their annual subscription in these initial three months. This situation is when the direct relation between engagement and retention comes into play. To make a solid argument regarding the value customers get from the product, investors want to see how many core app functionality interactions happen on average over the life of the respective subscribers’ cohort. For example, interactions beyond just opening your app mean subscribers are consciously seeking value. Each startup should define its “key engagements” and help users by guiding them toward this core activity inside the product."
9,"Mercedes debuts the Maybach EQS SUV with more power, range and luxury",['@mjburnsy'],"April 17, 2023","I can’t get over the huge faux grill. Mercedes today revealed the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV, an electric SUV built on its excellent EQS SUV. In this edition buyers get ultra-luxury appointments, including special cup holders designed to hold champagne flutes. Back to the grill. The Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV is dripping with historic Maybach design elements: two-tone paint, imposing wheels, a proper hood ornament and, yes, a grill with filigree slats even though it’s electric and there isn’t a radiator to protect. The interior is packed with exclusive features, including wood panels, front-and-rear massaging seats and more pillows than my bed. The dashboard sports three large screens (same as the standard EQS) with one for the instrument cluster, center stack and passenger. This EQS edition is the first Mercedes vehicle to use vegetable tanned leather with coffee bean shells used as the tanning agents. Mercedes is also keen on explaining its leather selection process, stating in a press release that its “leather supply chain is free from any form of illegal deforestation and the grazing areas do not contribute to the endangerment or loss of natural forests.” This Maybach version of the EQS has the same overall dimensions as its Merc brother, but the powertrain is significantly more potent. Power is increased in the Maybach edition with an AWD, dual-motor affair outputting 649 hp and 700 lb-ft. That’s a significant increase from the standard Mercedes version that features up to 536 hp and 633 lb-ft. The electric range is higher too, with a provisional WLTP range of 372 miles on a charge. Top speed is 130 mph and it takes 4.1 seconds to hit 60 mph. Even with the impressive powertrain, Maybach buyers might not care about how it feels to drive this vehicle. After all, Maybach owners do not drive their Maybachs. Maybach owners sit in the back, and their chauffeur drives. To that end, the backseat seems like a lovely place for a road trip. The rear seats are more luxurious than the front and are equipped with ventilation, massaging functions and neck and shoulder heating. If the Executive Rear Seat Package Plus is selected, the vehicle comes equipped with a calf massager, and when the rear seat reclines, the front passenger seat automatically moves forward for additional leg room. There’s even an optional refrigerator compartment, folding rear tables and a special compartment to hold the aforementioned champagne flutes. Compared to the standard EQS, this version seems like a worthy vehicle to carry the Maybach name, even if it has a questionable front end. It features a significant increase in range and power, and is equipped with enough luxury amenities to satisfy even the most ostentatious oil magnate. Pricing hasn’t been released yet; don’t expect a bargain.    "
10,Vue Storefront snaps up $20M to grow its open source-based ‘frontend-as-a-service’ e-commerce toolkit and platform,['@ingridlunden'],"March 23, 2023","The current slowdown in e-commerce growth, and in some pockets straight declines in spend, might not seem like the most opportune time to build an e-commerce tooling startup, let alone invest in one. But a startup out of Poland with a platform for front-end developers to build composable e-commerce sites has just raised $20 million on the back of strong interest in the market. Vue Storefront, which is building what it describes as “frontend as a service,” has closed a $20 million round, which it plans to use for R&D, to bring on more tools targeting B2B e-commerce businesses, and for business development after seeing revenues grow 300% in the last 18 months. It has some 2,000 customers, retailers and merchants, and is seeing quite a bit of growth at the moment in the U.S. The funding is being led by Felix Capital, a big player in e-commerce investing, particularly in Europe, with Philippe Corrot, founder & CEO of Mirakl; Nagi Letaifa, head of engineering at Mirakl; and previous backers Creandum, Earlybird and SquareOne also participating. Julien Codorniou, an ex-Facebook exec who is now a partner at Felix, is also joining the board. The company is describing this as a “Series A+,” with a Series A in 2022 bringing in $17.4 million. This is at a “slightly” higher valuation, so isn’t technically part of that round, although Vue’s CEO and co-founder Patrick Friday, and its investors, are not talking numbers on that front. Friday added that the reason for not calling this a Series B is also because the company wants to wait until the market settles down to raise what it believes will be a much bigger round at a much higher valuation. Rather disconcertingly, he thinks that won’t be for another two years, “at least.” The company’s roots are in open source, and it still runs a popular open source version of the software (the community for which has 19,000 members, it says) that helped it gain its initial popularity and traction in the market. The commercial version’s position is that using a composable framework — essentially by using APIs to pull in different tools built to improve functionality and usability to let them work together — to tackle the front-end is in line with how back-end development has been evolving. In all cases, this results in developers saving time, and in theory, producing front end interfaces that work better and can be more flexibly maintained to optimize purchasing conversions and engagement. Friday said it’s part of the trend of “detaching the monolith” in architecture. “For the last 20 years, people would just buy everything from one vendor, and that would be it. But now you might get a back end from one vendor, search from another, CMS from another, payments from another, and so on. The front end is the perfect place for integrations. We integrate with all of that and put the whole thing together.” Indeed, companies like Shopify and headless e-commerce platforms like Commercetools have changed the game for both smaller and larger merchants. The theory here is that Vue Storefront represents the next step on that trajectory, albeit one that others in the same space might also be looking to tackle in the longer term. All that is alongside other startups also focused on the front end, like Shogun in the U.S. The company has some 30 integrations as part of its commercial product, with hosting options and pre-built versions of some of the most popular components, alongside API orchestration tools to manage the different components that do get put together. Alongside the round, Vue Storefront is also announcing a new CTO, Tim Drijvers, who is coming on from Sendcloud (so perhaps we should expect to see more direct customer tools to add shipping and logistics into the front end mix?). Filip Rakowski, the other co-founder of Vue Storefront and had been its CTO, will be taking on a new role as “chief developer experience officer.” Felix has been focusing deeper into less developed markets in Europe as part of its strategy to tap less exposed and more emerging startups that others might not be looking at, and this investment underscores that as well as the idea of backing those who are helping e-commerce businesses do business in today’s market conditions. “E-commerce’s growth has slowed down, but everybody’s looking for solutions to improve customers’ experience and more importantly, conversion ratios,” Codorniou said. “Vue Storefront’s open source roots are also a big plus, as prospects can try before they buy and rely on a very active and vibrant community of developers and partners who contribute to making the product better every day.” Updated to clarify the name of the company, Vue Storefront not Vue Technology (which might take you here)."

12,Coinbase continues overseas expansion amid US regulatory pressure,['@jacqmelinek'],"April 20, 2023"," Chain Reaction has been nominated for a Webby award in the Best Technology Podcast category. Please take a few moments to vote here. Voting closes today, April 20. Welcome back to Chain Reaction. Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange in the world, has received its digital asset business license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, Bermuda Premier David Burt tweeted Wednesday night. Coinbase will open an offshore derivatives exchange there “as soon as next week,” according to a person close to the company, Fortune reported. This is the behemoth exchange’s latest expansion to grow internationally and expand its footprint, Coinbase shared in a series of tweets. Aside from the Bahamas, Coinbase has expanded in Abu Dhabi, Canada, Brazil and Singapore. It’s more than halfway through its eight-week international expansion drive, the company shared in a post. “As we have said previously, our approach globally will be consistent with our approach in the United States,” according to the company. These growth efforts point to the company’s attempt to expand its international business amid U.S. regulators cracking down on the crypto industry. Last month, Coinbase was issued a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Per a Coinbase SEC filing, the government agency’s staff has “advised the Company that it made a ‘preliminary determination’ to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company alleging violations of the federal securities law.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been an outspoken advocate for creating crypto regulation guidelines, but he’s criticized the U.S. regulators for regulating by enforcement. “Regulators should come up with the rules, tell everybody the rules and we follow them,” Armstrong said during a Twitter Spaces in March. “The current laws are not clear and we would like to get more clarity.” As the SEC charges Bittrex, there’s little evidence that it’s relaxing its regulatory posture The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Monday that it’s charging Bittrex, a crypto exchange, “for operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency,” among other things. In recent weeks we’ve seen the SEC take on Coinbase and Tron, not to mention Binance taking fire from a different American government agency (the CFTC). Suffice it to say that after lagging behind the crypto market’s growth, government regulators are stepping up to the plate. Despite regulatory concerns, the US is far from losing its venture crown (TC+) Coinbase is open to leaving the United States in the wake of a regulatory dispute with the government. A tone shift of that magnitude could have an impact on where the future of tech is being built and the opportunity of the global venture market ahead. But the Coinbase news doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Digital identities might be the best way to prove who you are online (TC+) One of the biggest drivers for digital identity is to be able to verify who you are and that what you’re saying is real amid the extreme (and somewhat scary) growth of artificial intelligence technology. While there’s a lot of hype around owning your own digital identity, there is a lot of growth that needs to happen to expand the sector and protect people. So you want funding for your NFT project? (TC+) The NFT market may be down from its 2021 peak, but founders, builders and collectors alike are still flooding into the space. And many are looking for fresh capital. Despite NFTs being a part of the web3 world, traditional business mechanics are unavoidable for founders in the post-boom market. Decentralized finance may be the answer to banking’s payment rails problem (TC+) Aging payment rails is not a new problem for the U.S. banking infrastructure, but Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse put it in the spotlight, especially for payment companies that had their payment rails with the bank. Some fintech founders say decentralized finance rails built on the blockchain could be a better answer. For this week’s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Jesse Pollak, the lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase. Base is an Ethereum-focused layer 2 blockchain launched by Coinbase in February of this year. Pollak previously led all retail engineering at Coinbase, including building Coinbase, Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Wallet. In a past life, Pollak started Clef, a 2FA mobile app and was an engineer at BuzzFeed. A number of crypto businesses, platforms, marketplaces and infrastructure firms have committed to building on Base. Those that plan to be involved include Blockdaemon, Chainlink, Etherscan, Quicknode, Aave, Animoca Brands, Dune, Nansen, Magic Eden, Pyth, Rainbow Wallet, Ribbon Finance, The Graph, Wormhole and Gelato, to name a handful. Of course, we talked a lot about Base and where it’s headed in the future, as well as how regulation could affect the blockchain and the timeline for its Mainnet launch; Pollak shared it’s aiming for 2023.

13,Netflix’s ad-supported plan comes to Apple TV after months of delay,['@laurenforristal'],"March 30, 2023","When Netflix launched its ad-supported plan four months ago, there were a few devices the plan didn’t support — Apple TV being one of them. Starting this week, the cheaper tier is available in the Netflix tvOS app. A Reddit user that goes by websgeisti noticed the update yesterday. The user noted that Netflix’s Basic with Ads plan is available on the latest version (2.3.0) of the Netflix app on Apple TV. Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that support on tvOS is now available for the ad-supported tier. Image Credits: TechCrunch Image Credits: TechCrunch Previously, Apple TV users were unable to access the ads tier and were instead asked to either upgrade to Netflix’s pricier plans or try on a different device. When TechCrunch reached out to Netflix back in November, the company told us that while the Basic with Ads plan isn’t available on tvOS at launch, it would be coming soon. The tier has yet to become available on Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra, PlayStation 3 and the Netflix app for Windows. Despite the delay in adding the supported devices, among other setbacks like fewer titles, Netflix previously shared how happy it was about the success of its new tier. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Netflix President of Worldwide Advertising Jeremi Gorman said there is a “broad swath” of advertisers on the platform. However, a month after it launched, analytics firm Antenna reported that only 9% of new Netflix subscribers in the United States signed up for the cheaper plan. Netflix rolled out its $6.99/month ad-supported plan in November 2022 to subscribers in the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Canada and Mexico. Ads are 15 to 30 seconds long, and there’s an average of four to five minutes of ads per hour. The Basic with Ads plan has a lower video quality of 720p HD and subscribers can only stream from one device at the same time. Around 5% to 10% of Netflix’s content catalog is unavailable due to licensing restrictions. Plus, subscribers don’t have access to offline viewing with the ad-supported plan.  "
14,‘Black Mirror’ Season 6 set to premiere in June,['@laurenforristal'],"April 26, 2023","“Black Mirror” is officially returning this June, Netflix announced today, bringing viewers a sixth season that will potentially make them feel like we’re all inching closer to a grim, tech-infused dystopian reality. Alongside the announcement, Netflix released the first teaser for season 6, featuring a space station in orbit, a haunting smiley face emoji that appears throughout the video — including on a smartwatch — and, of course, lots of gore and violence. The mind-altering season will have a star-studded cast, including Aaron Paul, Michael Cera, Salma Hayek Pinault, Rob Delaney, Himesh Patel, Annie Murphy, Rory Culkin, Kate Mara and Zazie Beetz, among others. “Black Mirror” creator Charlie Brooker hints that fans should expect the unexpected when watching this season as it’s shaping up to be the most surprising one yet. “Partly as a challenge, and partly to keep things fresh for both me and the viewer, I began this season by deliberately upending some of my own core assumptions about what to expect,” Brooker told Tudum, Netflix’s companion website. “Consequently, this time, alongside some of the more familiar Black Mirror tropes, we’ve also got a few new elements, including some I’ve previously sworn blind the show would never do, to stretch the parameters of what ‘a Black Mirror episode’ even is. The stories are all still tonally Black Mirror through-and-through — but with some crazy swings and more variety than ever before,” he added. If you’ve seen the show, then you know how insane the storylines can get. (Spoiler alert: The first episode of season 1 shows a prime minister forced to be with a pig on live TV in order to save a princess.) So, if Brooker says he’s going to push even further past those boundaries — you should probably believe him. Each episode of the satirical anthology series comments on society in some shape or form, such as the issues centered around webcam hackers, identity left, weird robotic dogs and the toxicity of social media. Some of us have even coined the phrase “living in a ‘Black Mirror’ episode” due to the brevity of strange events that have taken place in the past few years, including a businessman and reality TV star becoming the president of the United States, a global pandemic, Elon Musk taking over Twitter…just to name a few. “I’ve always felt that Black Mirror should feature stories that are entirely distinct from one another and keep surprising people (and myself) or else what’s the point? It should be a series that can’t be easily defined and can keep reinventing itself… I can’t wait for people to binge their way through it all and hope they enjoy it — especially the bits they shouldn’t,” Brooker added. Image Credits: Netflix Image Credits: Netflix After “Black Mirror” season 5 ended in 2019, fans were left waiting for another season. While viewers have grown accustomed to waiting long periods of time for the next “Black Mirror” season to drop, this four-year wait has been the longest so far. One explanation for the absence is an obvious one — COVID-19 flipped all our lives upside down in 2020, inevitability putting many productions on hold. However, the main reason “Black Mirror” stopped production is more complex than that. Brooker and his creative partner Annabel Jones left the production company House of Tomorrow in January 2020. They then began a new venture, founding Broke and Bones, in which Netflix invested. However, House of Tomorrow’s parent company Endemol Shine Group, which Banijay Group acquired, still had the rights to “Black Mirror.” Luckily, Netflix inked a licensing deal with Banijay so that the show could continue streaming on the platform. In May 2022, Variety reported that season 6 was greenlit and set to have more episodes than the season prior, according to Variety’s sources. The new episodes would also have longer runtimes and be “treated as an individual film,” the publication wrote. More recently, the Twitter account dedicated to “Black Mirror” decided to reemerge after years of silence. The account tweeted this week, “What have we missed?” sending a couple thousand fans into a frenzy. what have we missed? — Black Mirror (@blackmirror) April 25, 2023  Netflix’s Twitter account responded with, “Scientists are still creating robots that slowly harness more and more advanced AI like they haven’t watched a single episode of your show.” Brooker also hinted at the return, tweeting a thinking face emoji."
15,Betaworks’ new ‘camp’ aims to fund transformative early-stage AI startups,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 13, 2023","In a sign that the seed-stage AI segment is still alive and kicking, Betaworks, the startup studio and VC firm, is launching a new program that’ll award $500,000 in funding to approximately 10 companies working on AI. Scheduled to run from mid-June until mid-September, Betaworks’ program — the ninth of its kind — will provide startups access to benefits including a business-building curriculum and accelerated compute from companies including Hugging Face and Stability AI. That’s in addition to one-on-one mentorship time, events and activities, plus “collaboration opportunities” with other Betaworks cohort ventures. The program isn’t quite an accelerator; Betaworks describes it like a “camp.” Rather than writing a small check into companies across a range of categories, the firm’s looking at the “evolution” of technology and betting on a cohort that’s creating or defining a new category. “This is the biggest change in technology in my lifetime,” Betaworks CEO John Borthwick told TechCrunch in an email interview. “We’ve been building, accelerating and investing in and around machine learning for the last decade, and in the last 12 months, everything’s changed — the launch of generative visual models like [OpenAI’s] DALL-E 2 last year, the open and affordable access to these models with the availability of stability and GPT. AI has the potential to affect every sector, and every part of how we live, work, play and even die.” With the new “camp,” which is also being underwritten by Mozilla Ventures, Greycroft, and Differential Ventures, Betaworks is specifically looking to recruit companies creating AI tools that “augment the way humans behave, create, play, work and think.” For example, Borthwick says, this could be startups thinking about UIs that focus on the context of interactions over time, or ventures exploring the infrastructure required to allow for human collaboration alongside AI tools. “The AI stack hasn’t been fully defined yet,” Borthwick said. “Just like the early days of the internet, there will be extraordinary companies built, providing infrastructure and foundational tools, and there will also be middleware and applications that become embedded in our lives and augment pretty much everything we do.” When asked about the legal challenges facing some AI tech, particularly generative AI, and how it might affect the startups that Betaworks intends to fund, Borthwick didn’t shy away from answering. He expects copyright, intellectual property and attribution model ownership issues will play out over the next few years and ultimately not to have an adverse impact on startups in the space — or their business models. “Some laws and frameworks that we have today will apply and others will need to be made,” Borthwick added. “This is like the beginning of the internet where, for example, a ‘right to be forgotten’ rule hadn’t been considered yet because the technology hadn’t demanded it.” That might be optimistic. But Betaworks hasn’t let potential legal headwinds around AI get in the way before. The firm is funding Stability AI, which is currently embroiled in a legal battle over whether the company infringed on the rights of millions of artists by developing its text-to-image tools using web-scraped, copyrighted images. Stock image supplier Getty Images has also taken Stability AI to court for reportedly using images from its site without permission. Suffice it to say, Betaworks has an appetite for risk — and anticipates that the reward will be worth the struggle, apparently."
16,Reselling marketplace Kream’s valuation rises to $742M with $168M Series C,['@kateparknews'],"March 23, 2023","The funding environment for startups across the globe has been challenging for the past year, but some sectors are still attracting checks as if it was 2021. In Asia, one such sector appears to be the luxury fashion resale market, particularly for platforms that are seeing an uptick in users and sales. Kream, a reselling platform that lets people buy, sell and trade luxury goods like handbags, clothing and accessories, has raised a $168 million (220.6 billion won) in a Series C round that values it at about $742 million, more than double its previous valuation of $306 million in October 2021.  The new funding comes in the wake of a stellar couple of quarters at Kream: The company says its monthly active users have more than doubled to 5.3 million from 2.2 million last October, and its gross merchandise value shot up by 270% and 190% in Q3 and Q4, respectively, from a year earlier. Altos Ventures, a returning backer, led the Series C. Search engine and e-commerce giant Naver, SoftBank Ventures Asia, Mirae Asset Capital and new investors Samsung Securities and Axiom Asia also participated in the round. Kream was spun off from Snow, a camera app-focused branch of Naver, in January 2021. It has now raised a total of over $266 million.  The reselling platform has been making minority stake investments in its Asian peers, including Japan’s Soda, Thailand’s Sasom and Malaysia’s sneakers platform Shake Hands. The company will use the Series C funds to make more investments, mainly in Asia, chief business officer (CBO) Mingook Kim told TechCrunch, in line with its long-term goal of strategically connecting Asia-based reselling platforms so that its users can leverage Kream and its C2C resale affiliates to buy and sell luxury items.  Kream will also add more luxury items and emerging brands to its platform and expand its staff. It currently employs around 100 people.    Kream considers StockX and Hong Kong-based POIZON as its closest competitors. Its peers also include luxury goods resale platforms like Rebag, The RealReal, and Vestiaire Collective.   One of the biggest pain points for C2C reselling platforms is counterfeit goods, particularly for luxury items. Kim says Kream is working to implement an inspection program to eliminate that pain point for its users. After a seller lists their goods on the platform, the product will be sent to Kream’s inspection center, where it will be inspected for its authenticity. If their product passes internal inspection, the seller can go ahead and sell their product to the buyer. Once a transaction is completed between consumers, no refund is allowed, but the buyer can resell via the platform, a company spokesperson explained.  “Kream has tried to resolve the reliability of products and inconvenient transaction processes that customers felt most uncomfortable about while using C2C reselling platforms,” Kim said when asked about its differentiator. “Kream has secured the most data in South Korea to guarantee genuine products.” The luxury goods resale market was estimated to be worth $30 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow at 10% to 15% every year for the next decade, per a recent report by Mckinsey.

17,Yik Yak users are protesting the app’s makeover after acquisition by Sidechat,['@sarahintampa'],"April 3, 2023","Yik Yak users are enraged over the changes being made to the anonymous social app after its quiet acquisition by the similarly focused campus chat app, Sidechat. While Yik Yak had focused on anonymous posting within a local community, Sidechat is working to build private communities for colleges. Initially, Yik Yak had been pushing its users to migrate to the Sidechat app after the deal went through. But more recently, Yik Yak users tell us the company is pursuing a different strategy — instead of forced migrations, Yik Yak’s own app has been given a massive overhaul that effectively turns it into Sidechat. As Yik Yak user Aaron Payment, a student at St. John Fisher University, told us, the updated Yik Yak app is just “Sidechat reskinned now.” They also noted that if you sign up for Sidechat, you’ll see everything on your local Yik Yak because both apps appear to now be running on the same servers. “Not only did they change everything good about the app, but they made it so you have to use your college email to prove that you’re in college. That way, they can easily track you and share your data for marketing purposes,” Aaron explained. Before, Yik Yak only required a phone number to sign up. It’s not clear whether the company has plans to track its users or share their data, but it’s a valid concern for users of a previously anonymity-focused app, and an example of the difficulties any sort of anonymous app would have in finding an exit. Any changes that disrupt the app’s prior commitment to end users around protecting their identities are going to be met with skepticism, distrust  and anger. The latest changes were officially announced on Yik Yak’s Instagram account on Thursday where they soon received numerous complaints in the comments — many of which were receiving hundreds of likes, as well. In addition to users’ distaste for the updated Yik Yak, they were upset that the Android version of the app was also removed from Google Play. Yik Yak’s post, meanwhile, promised its revamp would include new features like images and polls, interest-based communities and fewer bugs. Image Credits: Yik Yak Instagram Image Credits: Yik Yak Instagram However, what wasn’t detailed in Yik Yak’s announcement was how the app’s functionality has also fundamentally changed. Before, users said they could save multiple locations so they could talk to various communities, but that’s now been removed. With the new Yik Yak, you are limited to communicating only with people in your school, and the five-mile radius option is gone. Some Yik Yak users were upset enough to start a petition, but so far it hasn’t reached its goal of 200 signatures, stalling out at around 182. The majority of those came in within the first 24 hours. Still, there are plenty of complaints to go around on Twitter and in the Yik Yak app itself, as users encounter the updated user interface and functionality. One group of users decided to try to spam the GIFs and messages to the app all at the same time in order to crash the servers, but the app remained up and running. Image Credits: Yik Yak screenshot Image Credits: Yik Yak screenshot Image Credits: Yik Yak screenshot Image Credits: Yik Yak screenshot Yik Yak itself acknowledged the backlash on Saturday, in a now-deleted tweet: “been a long week.” Plus, in a screenshot shared with Techcrunch by a Yik Yak user, Yik Yak PM Tom Zyzer posted some of the user complaints on his Story, joking “I love my fans and my fans love me!”     Image Credits: Yik Yak Twitter screenshot Image Credits: Yik Yak Twitter screenshot   Image Credits: Tzyer’s stories Image Credits: Tzyer’s stories This isn’t the first time Yik Yak has had a tumultuous exit. In 2017, the company closed its doors after Square (now Block) “acqui-hired” its engineers in a $1 million deal. It was a disappointing result for a company that had raised $73.4 million in venture funding and had once been valued at $400 million at its peak. The exit was a sign of the challenges ahead for a group of anonymous apps, where the ability to post without real-world consequences often lead to cyberbullying and abuse. Other apps, including Secret, also shut down or found their own ignominious exits. Some, like Sarahah, pivoted. But in more recent years, anonymous apps seemed to be making a return. After Snapchat banned anonymous Q&A apps from its platform, apps like Sendit, NGL and Slay took off by focusing on Instagram. Anonymous compliments app Gas sold to Discord. Even Sidechat now has competition from Fizz, an anonymous college-only app that was blowing up at Stanford. The current version of Yik Yak first launched in 2021, under new ownership — who also chose to stay anonymous. Sidechat’s owners haven’t revealed themselves, either, even when the app was profiled by The New York Times. However, an SEC filing for Sidechat’s parent company, Flower Ave., points to involvement from ex-Snap engineer Sebastian Gil and ex-Snap product designer Chamal Samaranayake. (We’ve confirmed this via sources to be accurate.) Per the filing, the company raised north of $10 million last summer, shortly after getting written up by various university press, like The Harvard Crimson and The Tufts Daily. Sidechat hasn’t returned requests for comment. From the looks of things, it doesn’t seem like the Yik Yak deal is paying off for Sidechat. The company was clearly hoping to boost its own user base with Yik Yak’s numbers in order to dominate the anonymous college-only app market. But if these angry users simply close their accounts and leave, then Sidechat may not have gained much of anything."
18,"Honey, I shrunk the revenue multiple",['@alex'],"April 24, 2023","With new leadership and a soon-to-be-thinned employee base, Lyft is going to look a heck of a lot different at the end of 2023 than it did at the start. After its co-founders said they’d relinquish their roles as CEO and president in March, the company last week said it intends to dramatically cut its staffing by as much as 30%. The changes were probably necessary. Lyft, as it turns out, is not nearly as valuable a company as its founders and backers once expected. That’s an odd thing to realize if your startup was able to raise billions while private and eventually price its public offering at $72 per share, raising more than $2 billion and commanding a fully diluted market cap of around $24 billion. Things have changed, though. Lyft’s shares ended last week at $10.44, up a solid 6% on the news of the impending layoffs. That helped it recoup some of its lost value, but the company is worth just $3.9 billion this morning. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. It’s somewhat strange to consider, but the ride-sharing company’s stock is trading near historic lows despite it reporting revenue of $1.18 billion in Q4 2022, its best single-quarter revenue result ever. The company lost around a third of its value after it forecast revenue for its first fiscal quarter below what analysts had estimated.  The lesson here is that quick revenue growth can make companies look like they’re excellent investments when capital is cheap, but it’s often hard for any firm to outrun the relative valuation range for its industry, even if it is tech enabled. Lyft is only the latest to join the group of public-market duds that have spent time as venture darlings. To pick only two examples: Allbirds has given up most of its historical value, and Warby Parker has shed around 80% of its peak valuation. The list is long and some of the most beat-up recent venture-backed IPOs share a quality today: Impressively low revenue multiples. We talk a lot on The Exchange about revenue multiples, mostly discussing what the value of one dollar of recurring, hosted software revenue is worth. We use this perspective frequently because software is the most common startup product and software as a service (hosted software, that is) is the most common business model."
19,"As tech slumps, SoftBank sells VC unit to Singapore-based firm led by Masayoshi Son’s brother",['@kateparknews'],"April 13, 2023","SoftBank is selling one of its venture capital arms, South Korea-based SoftBank Ventures Asia (SBVA), to The Edgeof, a Singaporean investment firm, according to the two companies.   The deal’s financial terms have not been disclosed, but the Singaporean VC firm aims to complete the acquisition this year.  Last month, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son’s younger brother Taizo Son and Atsushi Taira, managing director of Mistletoe, founded The Edgeof “with an aim to transform the startup ecosystem across Asia by creating a supportive environment for αStartups.” They define so-called “αStartups” as startups that have a mission to address fundamental problems in the world with advanced technology, according to the company’s statement.  The acquisition comes after SoftBank and its Vision Fund posted massive losses amid the tech slump and macroeconomic slowdown. In February, SoftBank said its investment vehicles posted a loss of nearly $6 billion in the quarter that ended in December, marking its fourth consecutive quarterly loss. Last May, the Japanese tech giant said in an earnings call that it would cut startup investments by 50-75% through March 2023.    SoftBank Ventures Asia has about $2 billion in assets under management (AUM) and has invested in a host of portfolios across Asia, including South Korea’s home interior app OHouse, Japan’s sneaker reselling platform SODA, Indonesia’s cloud kitchen startup Yummy and hyper-local social commerce company Super.   Some of the portfolio companies the Seoul-based VC firm invested in led to more considerable investments by SoftBank’s Vision Fund a few years later. These include Tokopedia, an Indonesia-based e-commerce platform that received funding from SBVA in 2014 and SoftBank’s Vision Fund in 2018; Iyuno, a provider of translated subtitles and other media localization services, which raised funding from SBVA and Vision Fund in 2018 and 2021, respectively; and Singapore’s cross-selling startup Carro, which also has picked up from SBVA and Vision Fund. Nigerian fintech Opay is another example that bagged capital from both SBVA and Vision Fund.  “We are excited to commence this new journey with The Edgeof,” JP Lee, CEO of SoftBank Ventures Asia, said in a statement. “By joining forces, SBVA will be able to leverage its expertise, insights, and network to support visionary entrepreneurs in their endeavours and enable them to make a lasting global impact that transcends Asia.” The two founders, Son and Taira, already established their venture capital firm, Mistletoe, in 2014, which invested in 250 startups worldwide. The existing VC firm will collaborate with The Edgeof to help discover “game-changing” startups, it says. The Edgeof will unveil a fresh brand identity once the acquisition deal is closed, according to the company.  “We are confident that our collective strengths and resources will ignite a new era of revolutionary technologies and solutions, establishing us as a prominent influence in developing and expanding αStartups worldwide,” Son said.

20,Fitbit will start prompting users to migrate to Google accounts this summer,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 11, 2023","Google and Fitbit have announced that existing Fitbit users will have the option to start logging in using a Google account this summer. Users aren’t required to move to a Google account immediately, but will need to do so by 2025. If you’re a new Fitbit user, you’ll be required to register with a Google account this summer. Today’s announcement isn’t surprising, given that the tech giant revealed last fall that it was going to require all Fitbit users to start logging in using a Google account in the future. Users will start seeing prompts upon opening the Fitbit app and will soon be able to get a jump start on the migration. Alternatively, users can also head over to the Settings menu. Google is positioning the new login requirements as being more convenient for users, even though it goes without saying that many users won’t be fond of the change. The company says that by moving away from Fitbit’s login system to its own, users will have unified privacy controls. Google also notes that users will also be able to see and manage where they are logged in across their Google account. “Moving to Google Accounts lets us build a great foundation for Fitbit’s future, while providing you with added benefits,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This is an important step to bring even more helpful updates and engaging experiences to you. There’s a lot more to come and we can’t wait to share more soon.” Besides the login experience, users shouldn’t expect any changes when accessing historical health and wellness stats. Google also reiterates that Fitbit health and wellness data won’t be used for Google Ads and will continue to be kept separate from Google Ads data. Ever since Google introduced the Pixel Watch last fall, the tech giant has been integrating Fitbit’s services and products into its own portfolio. Fitbit recently removed all adventures, challenges and open groups from its app. Prior to the company’s acquisition, Fitbit touted its social features as a bit part of its platform and community, so the change was a shock to users. By requiring users to eventually move to a Google Account, users will be moved even further away from the Fitbit experience they’ve become accustomed to over the past several years.  "
21,"Library e-book app OverDrive to shut down on May 1st, readers directed to Libby instead",['@sarahintampa'],"March 28, 2023","For over a decade, the OverDrive app has offered a service that allows institutions, including public libraries and schools, to lend their digital catalogs of e-books, audiobooks and other digital media to online users. Now, this longtime digital reading companion will be shutting down for good. After announcing its plans to sunset the app and removing it from app stores last year, the company now says that OverDrive will fully shut down on May 1, 2023. Readers will be directed to use the newer digital app Libby instead. The OverDrive app had been a part of readers’ workflows for many years, offering an easy way to access your digital library. But it’s fair to say the app was beginning to show its age in more recent years, requiring this shift. In August 2021, OverDrive first detailed its plans to transition users to its newer mobile app Libby and began the process of working with partnered institutions to guide their own respective user bases to make the switch as well. It suggested, for example, that libraries begin removing references to the OverDrive app from their websites and other promotional materials. Later, OverDrive app users were being asked to make the switch, too, with the goal of having most move to the newer Libby app by the end of 2022. Also last year, OverDrive removed the legacy app from the Apple App Store, Google Play and the Microsoft App Store so new users would not be able to find it and install it on their own devices. However, while the company had earlier shared its general plans around its sunset timeline for OverDrive, it only a few days ago announced the actual end-of-life date for the app as being May 1, 2023. Image Credits: OverDrive Image Credits: OverDrive At that time, OverDrive will be officially discontinued. To prepare for the transition, OverDrive has been offering libraries webinars and virtual training sessions, marketing kits and preparation checklists with best practices and recommended steps, among other things to help them prepare themselves and their patrons for the transition. While Libby is a newer app compared with OverDrive, it’s not really a “new” app. It was first released in 2017 as a modernized version of OverDrive, which incorporated feedback from OverDrive’s library partners and from book lovers. The app allows readers to enter their library card number, which is retained in the app, then browse their library’s catalog of e-books, audiobooks, magazines and other materials, and place items on hold. Once checked out, materials can be downloaded for offline reading or streamed to save space on your device. The app also supports multiple library cards, user-created book lists, adjustable font sizes, zoom for magazines and comic books, and the ability to send downloaded titles to the Kindle reading app in the U.S., among many other features. In addition, audiobooks can be streamed in-app or via Android Auto or CarPlay, with adjustable speeds. Image Credits: OverDrive Image Credits: OverDrive Some of Libby’s features weren’t ever available on OverDrive, including the support for multiple library cards and the unified bookshelf for all loans and holds. OverDrive also didn’t offer features like Libby’s ability to export notes and highlights, Sonos speaker integration or CarPlay. (OverDrive only supported Android Auto.) Libby also provides access to other entertainment resources, if supported by the library, like Kanopy, Craftsy, Universal Class, Indieflix and others. However, Libby will lack a few things found in OverDrive, including the “Recommend to Library (RTL)” feature, which is being discontinued across platforms with the app’s sunset. Instead, users are encouraged to use “Notify Me” to express their interest in titles not yet in their library’s collection. Libby is also not available on the Amazon Appstore. And it won’t support downloading audiobooks to a desktop computer — a feature once needed for transferring files to MP3 players. (For this niche use case, the legacy OverDrive apps for Mac and Windows will still be supported. ) The company says that winding down OverDrive will allow it to focus its resources fully on Libby. That’s something it may need to do, given the app has already experienced a few outages and issues this year, which rendered it inaccessible to users at times. The most recent outage occurred only yesterday, lasting for an hour and a half. It had impacted both Libby and Sora users. (The latter is another OverDrive-built app for students.) Ahead of May 1, OverDrive users on iOS, Android and Windows (8 and 10) will see a message in the app explaining why they’ll need to switch to Libby, which will link to a resource page about the transition. The page will explain how to sign into Libby and sync your OverDive wish list and answer general questions. Libby is available for iOS, Android and the web at libbyapp.com."
22,‘Game of Thrones’ fans are getting a new spinoff based on characters Dunk and Egg,['@laurenforristal'],"April 12, 2023","Among the many announcements during today’s Warner Bros. Discovery press event, the company revealed it greenlit a new Game of Thrones prequel called “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight.” A release date has yet to be announced, but the show will eventually debut on Max, WBD’s new streaming service. “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is based on George R.R. Martin’s series of “Dunk and Egg” novellas. The series will take place in Westeros and follow the adventures of a knight named Ser Duncan the Tall (Dunk) and young squire Aegon V Targaryen (Egg). Dunk is the future Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and Egg will one day become king. The spinoff occurs nearly 100 years before the events of “Game of Thrones,” when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne. It takes place in the same universe as “A Song of Ice and Fire.” Fans of the Dunk and Egg stories have waited years to hear more about the series since George R.R. Martin suggested the spinoff in a 2016 interview with Entertainment Weekly. More rumors of the “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” series circulated in 2020. The greenlit Max project is only the second Game of Thrones spinoff to make it to the streaming service. “House of the Dragon” generated an average of 29 million U.S. viewers per episode and is now in production for its second season. In addition to “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” WBD also announced many other exciting spinoffs derived from popular IP. This includes a Harry Potter series, the Batman spinoff series titled “The Penguin,” a drama series based on The Conjuring franchise, a comedy series based on The Big Bang Theory and more.  "
23,"Relativity Space’s first launch fails to reach orbit, but proves its 3D-printing rocket tech works",['@etherington'],"March 23, 2023","Relativity Space achieved a massively important milestone just before 11:30 PM ET on Wednesday, with the first ever flight of its 3D-printed rocket technology. Its Terran 1 rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, successfully clearing the pad and launch structure, and achieving ‘Max Q’ – or the point during the launch sequence at which the vehicle is under the most pressure in terms of atmospheric resistance and stress – and also succeeded at cutting off its main engines and separating its first stage as intended. The launch did not reach orbit, which is an extremely rare thing to happen on a new space launch platform’s first ever flight anyway. Relativity said during the launch that they encountered an anomaly with the second stage engines after main engine cut-off and stage separation, which meant Terran 1 didn’t continue on its intended path to low-Earth orbit. This test launch did not include a payload or fairing, but instead carried a demonstration weight in the form of an early 3D-printed part from the company’s rocket development process. Relativity Space’s first launch should definitely be counted as a success, as the company proved that its 3D-printed rocket body can withstand the extreme forces at play during that crucial ‘Max Q’ period. Basically, Max Q is the part of any launch when everyone in Mission Control holds their breath, because it’s when the odds are most stacked against the rocket surviving the various arrayed forces of physics. Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone founded Relativity Space in 2015, and the company has been iterating and scaling its 3D-printing tech ever since, expanding to larger and larger manufacturing facilities. The company announced a 1-million square foot rocket factory in 2021, where it intended to build its larger-capacity Terran R rocket, the bigger sibling to the small payload Terran 1 that launched on Tuesday.

24,A nine-figure raise in fintech? Oh my,['@bayareawriter'],"April 16, 2023","Welcome to The Interchange! If you received this in your inbox, thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you’re reading this as a post on our site, sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week, I’ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s my job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know. — Mary Ann Hi, since we had a little break last weekend, this edition of The Interchange is going to include news from the past two weeks. And there was a lot of it! But before we get there, let’s talk about something I haven’t had reason to write about for a long while: a nine-figure funding round. Clear Street, which says it is building “modern infrastructure” for capital markets, raised $270 million at a $2 billion valuation in the second tranche of a Series B raise. The extension was essentially raised at a flat valuation (the company was valued at $1.7 billion when it raised the first tranche of the round in May of 2022). Nonetheless, its ability to raise so much capital during such a challenging fundraising environment is impressive. Add to that the fact that it did not raise it at a lower valuation, and we’re doubly impressed (you can hear me, Alex, and Natasha riff more about that on the Equity Podcast here). A few things that are particularly notable about this: Anyway, it felt like a blast from the past to cover such a large raise and it only proves that my, how things have changed. After mentioning the shocking allegations against LGBQT+ focused fintech Daylight a couple weeks back, the company reached out to me with a statement from CEO and co-founder Rob Curtis, who struck back at former employees. Essentially, Curtis said the company “regrets” that “some former employees felt disappointed” that the company “would not go beyond the scope” of its mission and invest its “resources in addressing systemic, societal issues affecting LGBTQ+ people.” He added: “We’re equally sad that we could not meet their personal expectations of start-up culture and continue to wish them the best in the future.” He added: “Unfortunately, some of our former employees who were upset at being let go have since threatened the company with multi-million dollar settlement demands based on fabricated claims surrounding their employment. We disagree wholeheartedly with their negative characterization of our business, and Daylight is fully prepared to address these concerns in court.” It’s another case of he said/she said, which is sadly becoming all too common in fintech startup land. Another example of this, as reported by Banking Dive, involves Current, a New York City–based neobank that raised a $220 million Series D in 2021 (which TC’s Sarah Perez covered here) and “is being sued for sex, race and age discrimination by its former head of talent, who claims the fintech fired her shortly before she was set to return from medical leave.” Damn. Allegations of discrimination for any reason are not good. But in this case, Isabelle Mitura says she was discriminated against for multiple reasons. Not surprisingly, a spokesperson for the company told Banking Dive that the allegations in the lawsuit were “unfounded.” Seen on TechCrunch Reports Ivan Mehta: “Twitter has partnered with the investment platform eToro to show real-time information about stocks and crypto prices. This expands upon the social network’s Cashtag feature, which provided info about a limited number of stocks and crypto coins through TradingView data. The social media company first introduced the feature in December, letting users search for a ticker or coin symbol like $TSLA, $APPL or $ETH to get prices directly in search results.” More here. Reports Paul Sawers: “Visa is partnering with a host of financial service and payment companies for a new interoperable peer-to-peer (P2P) payment offering, one that allows people to transfer money to friends even if they use a different payment service. While digital payments have inarguably transformed the world of commerce, the sheer number of payment apps out there has hindered people’s ability to send money to other people without a little friction. If they’re both using PayPal, things work well. But if they’re not, then they either have to do a bank transfer or juggle multiple different P2P payment apps. Visa+, as Visa’s new service is called, is designed to solve that problem.” More here. As reported by me: “Redfin has laid off 201 employees, the third time the Seattle-based real estate company has reduced its workforce since June. The layoffs, which represent about 4% of its workforce, was first reported by GeekWire. A company spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and told TechCrunch in an email that the roles were primarily in ‘real estate support’ and were ‘due to the housing downturn and economic uncertainty.’” More here. Also in the world of proptech, TechCrunch learned last week that Austin-based Homeward conducted its third layoff since last August. The company said that this time 38 people, or 13% of the workforce, were impacted. Homeward had let go of 20% of its staff in August and then another 25% in November. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the first two cuts were “mainly about rightsizing” its operations team to reflect its “current contract volume with the changing housing market.” The rep added: “This time, though, we were primarily reorganizing our team to best support our new products, reduce redundancy and get closer to our goal of profitability.” TechCrunch covered Homeward’s 2021 $136 million Series B raise here. Reports Ingrid Lunden: “Stripe, the payments and fintech giant currently valued at $50 billion, sometimes feels like it has been forever on the brink of a public listing. But in the absence of any concrete IPO moves and the transparency that the listing process brings with it, it published an annual update with a few new numbers that paint a picture of where the company is standing right now.” More here. Meanwhile, Adyen also issued its 2022 annual report here. We didn’t get a chance to dive in there but Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot tweeted some interesting insights here. Reports Manish Singh: “Amit Jain, the former head of Uber’s Asia Pacific division, revealed his new venture, Zamp Finance, that aims to simplify the process for businesses to invest their excess capital in US Treasury bills to hedge against bank failures and other uncertainties. Zamp offers a treasury management platform that enables businesses worldwide to invest surplus cash in U.S. Treasury bills and notes, partnering with BNY Mellon Pershing, which manages over $2 trillion. The platform serves businesses of all sizes, it said.” More here. Reports Christine Hall: “When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed [in March], it sent massive waves across the banking and venture capital worlds, and beyond. Companies like Rippling, Brex and many others scrambled to secure funding to offset not being able to access funds, while companies on the payments side, like Etsy, worked to find alternative ways to process payments. Spend management company Airbase found itself straddling both of those worlds during the SVB crisis. TechCrunch+ spoke with CEO Thejo Kote about how Airbase not only had its funds with SVB but also was ‘the only spend management company that uses SVB as the payment rails for large parts of our platform.’” More here. Reports Manish Singh: “In a move reminiscent of its successful early bet on the government-backed UPI network seven years ago, PhonePe, India’s leading mobile payments app, is now setting its sights on the e-commerce sector. The Bengaluru-based startup, backed by retail giant Walmart, [earlier this month] launched a hyperlocal commerce app, called Pincode, that is powered by the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), an Indian government initiative striving to democratize the e-commerce landscape by offering a zero-commission platform.” More here. Reports Tage Kene-Okafor: “Verto, a London-based B2B cross-border foreign exchange (FX) and payments enabler for startups and small businesses, said it has acquired a quarter of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) customers from Africa and the MENA region. According to the startup’s own data, SVB had nearly 250 clients operating in both regions before its collapse — the American bank provided startups with venture debt, credit cards, and term loans. Thus, it is onboarding over 60 companies and venture firms (some with headquarters in the U.S. and Europe), including Jumia, Chipper Cash and Taptap Send.” More here. As reported by me: “The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Charlie Javice, the founder of student financial aid startup Frank, with fraud in connection with the $175 million sale of the company to JPMorgan Chase Bank in 2021.” More here. Reports Mike Butcher: “As unease spread amongst a handful of entrepreneurs, alarmed at radical “reforms” proposed by the Benjamin Netanyahu-led government regarding the independence of the judiciary, WhatsApp groups were fired up, and were quickly flooded with volunteers from the tech industry.” For months, the country has been home to protests, “many of which were directly coordinated by Israeli tech entrepreneurs and investors. The latter have collectively become a key driver in the movement against the government’s proposals, alarmed as they are that Israel’s hallowed ‘Startup Nation’ reputation was at threat if the sacred rule of law became questioned at home and abroad.” Read more here. A couple of weeks back, Haje Kamps wrote about how Smoakland was testing a loophole to sell cannabis by credit card. The test failed, apparently. As reported by Haje last week, Smoakland’s director of marketing and e-commerce Jeff Dillon told TechCrunch: “Upon further review, it has come to our attention that the way the process was described in the article could potentially be seen as bank fraud. As a result, our process partner has terminated our relationship,” More on that retreat here.

25,Push Security raises $15M to help SaaS users lower their online vulnerability,['@ingridlunden'],"April 3, 2023","To keep a company secure in today’s digital universe, it takes a village — specifically, all the company’s employees, who have to be on their guard pretty much all the time to avoid phishing, credit stuffing and other kinds of common attack vectors and techniques that lead to their data and that of their businesses being compromised. A London startup called Push Security believes it can help in that effort — not by blocking online activity and app usage, but by monitoring when users are making iffy choices with web-based apps and showing how to fix them. Today it’s announcing $15 million in early-stage funding to expand that effort. The Series A is being led by GV (Google Ventures), with Decibel and a number of angels participating. (The individuals include Duo Security co-founders Dug Song and Jon Oberheide.) The funding follows a $4 million seed and some notable signs of early traction. The startup says that since it launched in July 2022, its tools have been adopted by “hundreds” of teams and some 50,000 users, with customers including Reachdesk, Upvest and Tray.io (whose founder and CEO Rich Waldron is also an angel investor in this round). Adam Bateman, the co-founder and CEO of Push Security, said that he came up with the idea for Push after years of working as an ethical hacker and observing a lot of the most common errors and practices among employees. One thing that came up time and again was the fact that no matter how strong a company’s security policies were — and no matter how much it invested in firewalls, endpoint solutions and the rest — human actions around bad password choices, inadvertently clicking on dodgy links and unknowingly sharing things they’re not supposed to often proved to be the first chink in the armor. Push’s starting point is to accept that there are certain behaviors that will be second nature to people: Namely, they will want to use web-based apps at work that help them work better, even if those tools have not been provisioned by IT. That has exploded as a trend, especially in the last couple of years, with more people working remotely and cloud-based architectures becoming the norm for them. Push’s approach follows a few different tracks: It watches how those apps are used and then automatically “pushes” suggestions to employees when it spots them using those apps in less secure ways — say, by choosing easy-to-guess passwords; it “pushes” notifications to security and IT teams to give them summaries of activity so that they are kept in the loop; and it then adds the app to a dashboard for those teams to monitor and flags when those apps pose a danger because they in themselves may have security issues and bars those that might be downright dodgy. Image Credits: Push Security Image Credits: Push Security The key is that Push tries to be friction-free by not barring activity, but it enables better practices by pushing better suggestions to everyone. Bateman likens its approach to that of Grammarly. “You don’t have to but it can stop you from making mistakes,” he said in an interview. “It’s the same with us. Push keeps you safe. A lot of work we do on the human level is not to be the enforcer, to be the guard rail not a gate.” So while there are hundreds of companies in the market offering password management, app management, desktop management, firewalls, blacklists and whitelists, and more, what’s caught investors’ attention here is the idea of a tool that lets people continue to work as-is. “The global workforce is moving toward greater freedom and flexibility with SaaS applications, which introduces new security complexities and challenges,” says Karim Faris, general partner at GV, in a statement. “That trend presents a critical need for better, simpler tools that engage employees and take the burden off centralized IT to manage SaaS sprawl. GV is excited to partner with the Push team as they help modern security teams navigate the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.” All of this operates currently for employees who are already using Office 365 or Google Workspace emails to manage their log-ins to apps they use for work, Bateman said. If someone tries to sign up for a work app using a non-work email, that too is flagged. Push Security is designed just to work on desktops and laptops — not mobile. That’s because mobile device management, which typically includes apps and other mobile usage, is already a very well-covered area. More murky are desktops where people can download SaaS from the internet very easily. The growth of SaaS has opened up a new world of productivity for workers, but it’s also opened up a can of security worms. Given that a lot of apps ask to “access your contacts” and other data in order to work most effectively (which is why so many log in with their work credentials in the first place), it creates a potential data leak if those accounts are not subsequently managed responsibly. In Push’s research, it found that 23% of Microsoft integrations, and 17% of Google integrations monitored through its platform “granted access to high risk assets and data such as email, calendar, and shared drives” and as a measure of how many places people are using these credentials, among Microsoft app integrations, only one-third were approved by IT via OAuth. (The other two-thirds, Push said, were provisioned “directly by employees with no IT oversight or visibility.”) It didn’t provide corresponding data for Google-based app integrations. Push says it has added close to 500 SaaS apps to IT dashboards since it was launched less than a year ago. In other words, beyond the most popular, or approved apps used by its customers, there have been another 500 collectively picked up organically by employees across that customer base, representing a potential leakage nightmare."
26,Spotify is testing new card-style user profiles focused on discovery,['@sarahintampa'],"March 29, 2023","At Spotify’s Stream On event this month, the company introduced a redesigned app with TikTok-like discovery feeds, an AI DJ and other tools for artists and podcasters. But the app’s changes may not be stopping there. The company confirmed it’s now testing a revamp of its user profiles, which includes a card-style layout that lets users establish more of a social identity on the platform in addition to providing easy access to Spotify’s unique features — like its personalized recommendations, Blend playlists, co-listening experiences and more. The changes were first spotted by Chris Messina, who shared screenshots of the tests on Twitter. He noted the additional cards on profiles and how the new layout was directing users to tap a button to “discover more features.” Some Spotify users, however, said they’ve had the updated profiles for some time. But that’s only because the feature has been in live testing in multiple markets. These profiles are not fully rolled out to all users. This is big! Spotify is previewing a new profile design! 👤 It appears that more profile cards will be coming soon. It recommends discovering ""more features"" to ""get the most of your listening experience"".#NewSpotify pic.twitter.com/Qcctw3PJU7 — Chris Messina (chrismessina@mastodon.xyz) (@chrismessina) March 28, 2023  Spotify did not commit it would make the feature available for everyone at any particular time. Often, the company’s new ideas are tested in public, then modified based on user engagement and feedback before a global rollout. Or, in some cases, they’re scrapped entirely. That said, it’s not as likely that this one would be dropped, given how well it fits with the new Spotify redesign which puts greater emphasis on discovery. “We routinely conduct a number of tests,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch when asked about the new profiles. “Some of those tests end up informing our user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don’t have anything further to share at this time,” they added. Image Credits: Chris Messina via Twitter
(opens in a new window) Image Credits: Chris Messina via Twitter
(opens in a new window) Among the notable changes in this version of the user profiles is the new heading at the top of the screen that looks more like something you’d see on a social network. Currently, Spotify user profiles are fairly bare-bones. The person’s name as well as their follower and following counts are displayed above lists of their playlists and recently played artists. The new profiles, by comparison, include other details about the person like which Spotify plan they’re subscribed to, how long they’ve been a Spotify member, their general location (like the U.S.), in addition to their follower and following counts, a button that lets you follow them and another for profile edits. There’s also a fun feature that apparently lets you set a “vibe” above your name, to give your profile a little pizazz. Image Credits: Chris Messina via Twitter
(opens in a new window) Image Credits: Chris Messina via Twitter
(opens in a new window) The new profiles still feature sections for your playlists and artists, but these now appear as cards and there are more interactive features available next to these options. For instance, you can now click a button to create a new playlist right from your profile, or use buttons beside each playlist to share them with others. Next to each artist’s name, there also are buttons that let you follow the artist on Spotify — before, you’d have to click into the artist profile to do so. This could be particularly useful if you had visited someone else’s profile and were discovering new artists through their activity. Under the “Discover more features” section on the new profiles, users are pointed to other things they can do on Spotify — like find live events, “like” more songs to improve their recommendations, create Blends with friends, check out Spotify’s new audiobooks and more. The profiles also include a message at the bottom that reads “View more cards,” which indicates there will be future additions coming to this space beyond the playlists and recently played artists. But this feature isn’t fully built out yet — Messina told us that, when clicked, the in-app message reads “there’s nothing to see here yet” and informs users that Spotify is “busy building more content for you — coming soon.” (May we suggest incorporating podcast recommendations into this experience, please?) These changes would make sense as part of Spotify’s broader focus on discovery that’s driving its most recent app updates. That is, instead of just showcasing a user’s basic information and activity, these redesigned profiles would allow people to explore more of what Spotify has to offer while also making it easier to find and enjoy new artists and music directly from someone else’s profile with fewer clicks."
27,James Murdoch’s fund slashes investment in Reliance-backed Viacom18,['@refsrc'],"April 14, 2023","James Murdoch’s venture fund Bodhi Tree slashed its planned investment into Viacom18 to $528 million, down 70% from the committed $1.78 billion, the two said late Thursday as the weakening global economy hammers investors’ appetite. Viacom18, a joint venture between Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance and Paramount Global, did not say why Bodhi Tree slashed its pledged investment. The planned investment was initially scheduled to close by October last year, according to an earlier statement. Murdoch announced Bodhi Tree with his long-time collaborator Uday Shankar last year. Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar, is the largest investor in Bodhi Tree. Bodhi Tree pledged an investment of $1.78 billion into Viacom18 in the fund’s maiden backing in April last year. Reliance, which owns a majority of Viacom18, said in a statement that it’s contributing $1.32 billion to the media giant, up from the planned $216 million. “The partnership will enable Viacom 18 to innovate and disrupt the M&E sector, with Uday Shankar and James Murdoch providing strategic and operational guidance to Viacom 18, leveraging their track-record of building iconic media businesses. Uday Shankar has been appointed to the Board of Viacom18,” Reliance said in a statement. As part of the investment, Viacom18 said last year that it will supercharge JioCinema, an on-demand video streaming service owned by telecom giant Jio Platforms. Reliance and Viacom18 have made the streaming of the IPL cricket tournament free to anyone with an internet connection in India in a push to court customers away from Disney, whose Hotstar app won over 50 million subscribers on the back of wild popularity of cricket content.   Viacom18 — a venture between Ambani’s Reliance and Paramount — recently outbid Disney to secure five years of IPL’s streaming rights for the Indian subcontinent region with a sum of $3 billion. In a joint statement, Murdoch and Shankar said last year that they seek to “reshape the entertainment experience across more than 1 billion screens.” The duo earlier ran a fund called Lupa that invested in a number of Indian startups, including short-video platform and news aggregator DailyHunt and edtech DoubtNut. Shankar began working with Murdoch when he was overseeing News Corp’s Asia business. The Indian entrepreneur left Disney in late 2020 after spending two years as its president for the Asia-Pacific region and chairman of its India operations. He helped the struggling Indian television network in 2007 into becoming one of the nation’s largest media groups. Alongside Ajit Mohan, who has since moved to the leadership position for Snap in Asia, the duo helped the firm enter the streaming business with Hotstar, which has since amassed hundreds of millions of users and is a crown jewel in Disney’s streaming play."
28,Google Authenticator can now sync 2FA codes to the cloud,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 24, 2023","Google Authenticator just got an update that should make it more useful for people who frequently use the service to sign in to apps and websites. As of today, Google Authenticator will now sync any one-time two-factor authentication (2FA) codes that it generates to users’ Google Accounts. Previously, one-time Authenticator codes were stored locally, on a single device, meaning losing that device often meant losing the ability to sign in to any service set up with Authenticator’s 2FA. To take advantage of the new sync feature, simply update the Authenticator app. If you’re signed in to a Google Account within Google Authenticator, your codes will automatically be backed up and restored on any new device you use. You can also manually transfer your codes to another device even if you’re not signed in to a Google Account by following the steps on this support page. Some users might be wary of syncing their sensitive codes with Google’s cloud — even if they did originate from a Google product. But Christiaan Brand, a group product manager at Google, asserts it’s in the pursuit of convenience without sacrificing security. “We released Google Authenticator in 2010 as a free and easy way for sites to add ‘something you have’ 2FA that bolsters user security when signing in,” Brand wrote in the blog post announcing today’s change. “With this update we’re rolling out a solution to this problem, making one time codes more durable by storing them safely in users’ Google Account.” Of course, Google hasn’t always maintained an abundance of transparency around Authenticator’s roadmap. The app began as an open source project, but later became proprietary; the official open source forks of the Android, iOS and BlackBerry apps haven’t been updated in years. Fortunately, if Authenticator doesn’t float your boat, there are loads of alternatives for 2FA. Authy is among the most popular, but Duo is another popular choice — and, for what it’s worth, The New York Times’ top pick."
29,OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation,"['Jagmeet Singh', 'Ingrid Lunden']","April 28, 2023","Updated to note that the Microsoft investment closed in January. The money from VCs reported here, part of a tender offer, is separate to that. OpenAI, the startup behind the widely used conversational AI model ChatGPT, has picked up new backers, TechCrunch has learned. VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion – $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft’s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source. If all this is accurate, this is the closing of the tender offer the Wall Street Journal reported was in the works in January. We confirmed that was when discussions started, amid a viral surge of interest in OpenAI and its business. We have reached out to the investors named here, as well as to OpenAI, for comment and will update this story as we learn more. OpenAI declined to comment on the tender offer, which is separate to the Microsoft investment that closed in January. While Microsoft’s investment comes with a strong strategic angle — the tech giant is working to integrate OpenAI’s tech across a number of areas of its business — the VCs are coming in as financial backers. From what we understand, the term sheets have been signed by investors and the money’s been transferred; still to come is countersigning from OpenAI. The plan was to make this investment public next week. Altogether, outside investors now own more than 30% of OpenAI, the source said. According to PitchBook data, it appears that Peter Thiel had already been a backer but it seems this is the first time Founders Fund will be investing; K2 Global, a firm with just one partner, Ozi Amanat, and Thrive are also first-time backers of the startup. From PitchBook data, it looks like Sequoia and A16Z had been earlier investors in the company. A number of firms, including Sequoia, have had some knocks as a result of the financial crisis the tech sector has seen in the last year; in general, a number of VCs have massively slowed down their investing pace, sitting on so-called “dry powder” waiting for a better climate, and maybe better opportunities. So at a moment when investors are on the hunt for interesting AI startups to back, OpenAI is likely seen as the kind of opportunity that looks good right now. “They’re probably trying to use this [funding] to say hey, look, we found a golden apple,” a source said of the decision to back OpenAI here and now. “Venture is a very strange place where anything can happen. You can go big to broke to big again, at any time.” OpenAI has an army of technical teams working across a range of areas, but the area that has attracted a lot of attention of late is GPT, short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which is OpenAI’s family of large language models used by third parties by way of APIs. There is also ChatGPT, the generative AI service that OpenAI released at the end of November 2022 based on GPT that lets anyone type out a natural question and get a cogent, detailed answer. ChatGPT has been a certifiable hit, with more than 1 billion visitors to its website in February, says SimilarWeb — and that’s not including those using that tech via third parties. Generative AI is very much all the rage right now, but OpenAI has its controversies, too, with many focused on that buzzy, consumer-facing ChatGPT product. People have questioned whether it lies, whether it is a “virus“, how it handles privacy, if it can be manipulated to be toxic, or commit libel; and in the wake of so many more rushing into AI development, even the very nature of how “open” OpenAI’s GPT branding will be longer term has come up for discussion. In fairness, OpenAI has acknowledged the work that still needs to be done, and meanwhile it’s continued to develop services and iterate. In February, the startup introduced a paid version of ChatGPT, called ChatGPT Plus with a faster user experience. It was upgraded with multimodal LLM GPT-4 in March.   Key to the proposition, OpenAI’s valuation, and the likely interest of investors is that, alongside the technology, there is also a rapidly developing ecosystem around that tech. In addition to the hundreds of millions of people who have played around with ChatGPT, hundreds of businesses large and small have started deploying GPT and ChatGPT into their products and services. That has also been a fillip to other big tech companies speed up the roll out of their own efforts in generative AI. Google has launched Bard and Meta also introduced LLaMA to take on GPT with its proprietary LLM. OpenAI, however, has some undeniable gravity amidst the competition, not least because of its singular focus on the AI space since its founding in 2015. That’s been even as it has gone through some significant changes — including shifting from its original non-profit model. We don’t really know if AI will precipitate the seismic shift that many say it will, but as one person put it: OpenAI may be the closest thing we have to a winner in the space right now. “We’ve been working on it for so long, but it’s with gradually increasing confidence that it’s really going to work,” co-founder and CEO Sam Altman said at an AI conference earlier this month. “We’ve been [building] the company for seven years. These things take a long, long time. I would say by and large in terms of why it worked when others haven’t: It’s just because we’ve been on the grind sweating every detail for a long time. And most people aren’t willing to do that.” In addition to ChatGPT, OpenAI has its AI-based image-generation tool called Dall-E that received a significant update in July last year. It also has speech recognition model Whisper AI. Microsoft’s efforts have included integrating OpenAI’s APIs with its Azure infrastructure to support the computational requirements of the models. It also in March announced a GPT-4 integration to supercharge Bing, part of Microsoft’s longstanding efforts to make a dent in the dominance of Google’s search services. Updated to remove Tiger from this story; it did not participate in this share sale but is an investor in OpenAI.    "
30,"Casetify launches iPhone cases that look like Crocs with Jibbtiz. Yes, for real.",['@sarahintampa'],"March 27, 2023","Have you ever wanted an iPhone case that looks like a pair of Crocs? You know, the ugly-but-comfy slip-on shoes covered in holes that you can optionally decorate with colorful push-pins? You haven’t? Well, apparently some designer at smartphone case maker Casetify saw a pair of Crocs and thought to themselves, wow, that would make for a great iPhone case!! No, we’re not kidding. Casetify this month launched a new series of iPhone cases that look exactly like Crocs shoes, complete with their trypophobia-inducing holes and sets of pushpin decorations that allow you to personalize your phone case with things like flowers, rainbows, smiley faces and…uhhh…a stick of butter. A piece of toast. A snail. A motel keychain?? I’m sorry, but what the actual **** is going on here? These cases are selling for $52! While TechCrunch doesn’t typically cover smartphone cases or accessories, when we saw this new product line we knew we had to make an exception because of its truly oddball nature. Is this press release a prank? Is this an early April Fool’s? Vaporware? Have we time-traveled to the 1980s for new product ideas? We regret/are happy to inform you that these cases are real. We have them in hand and have put them through their paces. Here’s what we can report. The cases themselves come in black, lavender, cream and pink. They’re soft and flexible with their silicone finishings, as described. They also have bumpers on the corners and the promised raised bezel to help protect the screen. Casetify says they provide up to 4 feet of drop protection. But of course, no one is buying these cases for their protection capabilities. They’re buying them for the “aesthetic” if they’re buying them at all. Available only for iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, the cases have either 13 to 14 holes designed to hold the pushpins. These are sold in sets of five pins that sell for $22 — this is not a cheap joke to participate in! Image Credits: Casetify Image Credits: Casetify At launch, there are four main sets available: a “cottage core” set with a mushroom, snail, strawberry, flower and duck; a “retro west” set with a Dalmatian-spotted cowboy hat, matchbox, cowboy boot, motel keychain and 70s-looking happy-faced flower (no, I don’t know how the flower is western either); a “diner breakfast” set with the aforementioned butter and toast, a smiley face, checkered heart and the text “thank you!” as you’d find on your diner check; and the “peace love earth” set with a teddy bear, heart-shaped world, happy-faced daisy, yin yang symbol and happy rainbow. Image Credits: Casetify Image Credits: Casetify There is also a Limited Edition “Barbie” set with pink Barbie pushpins like Barbie’s face, brand, jacket, heart-shaped glasses and the year “1959.” That one sells for $82! Eighty…two…dollars.  I don’t even…why?!?… We asked Casetify how it came up with this um, “unique,” idea. The company told us that it’s designed many innovative products over the past few years, like its mirror cases, pillow cases and bounce cases, and it thought these new pushpin cases would simply offer its customers “new ways to express themselves with their everyday tech.” “The first pin sets we’ve produced were developed with our best-selling prints in mind, and also taking into account trending products among Gen Z and millennials,” a spokesperson said. When we asked what was the deal with the butter, they noted, “might be shocking to know that food-related items sell really well haha!” Image Credits: Casetify Image Credits: Casetify Okay, but butter? Really? Is that because of that viral butter bench? Have phone cases now tied themselves to niche TikTok trends? Plus, there’s the cottage core set that’s also seemingly inspired by the internet trend that romanticizes country life and living in harmony with nature — an aesthetic that grew in popularity thanks to TikTok’s subcommunities driven by its personalized algorithms. Now it’s jumped from the screen into your pocket. In any event, despite having giant pins sticking out of the back of the case, it wasn’t too hard to shove the decorated case into your pocket or pull it out. The cases and the pins are fairly smooth, so while they tug a little on your clothes, it ends up not really getting any more stuck than, say, your Popsockets grip, for example. Meanwhile, actually decorating the case with pins wasn’t too difficult either. Pushing the pins in did require a little effort, particularly on the bottom row for some reason, but once in they felt fairly secure. The pins can be mixed and matched based on your mood, Casetify says, but the debut selections were fairly limited. Of course, we had to try jamming some Crocs Jibbitz (aka Crocs pins) into the holes of the case just to see. After all, if the cases supported Jibbitz, that would have opened up a wide array of customization options! But sadly, the rounded-backed Jibbitz we had on hand — these sparkly Hello Kitty charms — were just too large. Bummer. Casetify says it’s planning to release more pin sets and cases in the future, including through upcoming brand collaborations, like the one it did a few months ago with Barbie, which precipitated the Push-In case line. We don’t know which aesthetic community will be next to get the pushpin treatment, but there are plenty of “-cores” to choose from."
31,Saildrone takes the wraps off its Voyager autonomous research vessel,['@techcrunch'],"March 28, 2023","Saildrone has quickly risen to the surface of the growing field of autonomous seagoing vehicles — a category you could be forgiven for not knowing about but that is increasingly important across numerous industries. Its latest vessel, the Voyager, strikes a balance between its shorter Explorer and large-scale Surveyor, and they’re already making one a week. The Voyager is a 33-foot uncrewed surface vehicle, or USV, intended for near-shore maritime operations like coastal and lake mapping. In addition to the expected sonar equipment, each craft is equipped with traditional cameras, radar, and “sub-surface passive acoustics” to help build a picture of the sea or lake bed down to a depth of 900 feet. It also integrates other improvements, like more power and a more consistent data uplink. You can imagine how useful it would be to send one of these things around every month to provide up-to-date metrics on your harbor or channel. In addition to the ordinary changes that come with tidal action and redistribution of silt and soil, it could identify illegal dumping sites, drifting trash like tangles of fishing equipment, and other unwelcome developments. Naturally there are security applications as well: “illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing” is a huge problem, especially given the fragile state of marine ecosystems right now. And more traditional law enforcement operations like combating smuggling would also benefit from a bit of all-hours surveillance. It doesn’t just have to be a floating cop, though. The data provided by autonomous platforms like Saildrone’s is useful for research purposes. The various sensors on board can detect wave action, salinity, water temperature, and lots of other metrics that oceanographers, meteorologists and the like can’t get enough of. Image Credits: Saildrone Image Credits: Saildrone And as near-shore industries like seaweed farms and fisheries multiply in the new blue economy, this data contributes to a more accurate picture of the ever-changing ocean. Saildrone vessels don’t need people on them, of course, which means they can spend lots of time at sea or at inhospitable locations like polar waters. The Voyager has been undergoing testing since February of last year when the first prototype went into the water, and it has been revised several times since — the company said it is really always in development mode as new technologies and use cases become available. Saildrone is now moving into full production mode. The company has built 100 of its smaller Explorer craft since it was founded years ago, but now it is ready to pump out a Voyager a week. To do so, it must outsource manufacturing of the wing, keel, and hull to partners Janicki Industries and Seemann Composites, though the final vessel will be assembled and serviced at Saildrone’s main space in Alameda, California."
32,TikTok ban backup plan? ByteDance-owned Instagram rival Lemon8 hits the US App Store’s Top 10,['@sarahintampa'],"March 28, 2023","As U.S. lawmakers move forward with their plans for a TikTok ban or forced sale, the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance is driving another of its social platforms into the Top Charts of the U.S. App Store. ByteDance-owned app Lemon8, an Instagram rival that describes itself as a “lifestyle community,” jumped into the U.S. App Store’s Top Charts on Monday, becoming the No. 10 Overall app, across both apps and games. Today, it’s ranked No. 9 on the App Store’s Top Apps chart, excluding games. This is a dramatic move for the little-known app and one that points to paid user acquisition efforts powering this surge. Prior to yesterday, the Lemon8 app had never before ranked in the Top 200 Overall Charts in the U.S., according to app store intelligence provided to TechCrunch by data.ai. The firm confirms that such a fast move from being an unranked app to being No. 9 among the top free apps in the U.S. — ahead of YouTube, WhatsApp, Gmail and Facebook — implies a “significant” and “recent” user acquisition push on the app publisher’s part. Unfortunately, because the app is so new to the App Store’s Top Charts, third-party app analytics firms don’t yet have precise data on Lemon8’s U.S. installs, or how those installs have recently changed over the past few days. But given the app was launched globally back in March 2020, what’s most likely is that it was quietly released on the U.S. App Store, but only for testing purposes. Then, sometime over the past few days it was more “officially” launched, meaning it was accompanied by this clearly sizable spend on paid discovery or app install ads. Image Credits: Lemon8 Image Credits: Lemon8 According to app intelligence provider Apptopia’s data, Lemon8 debuted on both iOS and Android in March 2020 and has since gained 16 million global downloads, with Japan as its top market, accounting for 38% of its total installs. While the firm also doesn’t have a figure for its U.S. installs, it was able to estimate the app currently has 4.25 million monthly active users. Apptopia noted it didn’t yet see Lemon8 having spent on paid search on either the App Store or Google Play, but cautioned it may have paid install campaigns that just haven’t populated in its system yet or spend that’s on networks it doesn’t have insight into. However, we believe ByteDance might simply be leveraging one of its own channels to drive app installs: TikTok. Over on TikTok, we noticed a number of creators recently began posting about Lemon8, with many new videos appearing in just the past 24 hours. Concerningly, many of their reviews are extremely positive but are not marked as sponsored content. For example, says one creator, Gabrielle Victor speaking to her 435.3K followers, “it’s so f***ing cute. Aesthetically pleasing. It’s like Pinterest and Instagram came together and had a baby.” Another creator, Passion Willems (73.9K followers) recommends, “if you haven’t heard of it, I recommend you run over to the App Store and download it!” Other creators, though, are more suspicious about the TikTok community’s sudden interest in the new app. Ponders Alexandrea Brumfield, “is it a conspiracy that I’ve seen so many of these [Lemon8] videos back to back to back with the TikTok ban being in the news right now?” Her concerns may not be unfounded. Last month, Insider reported that ByteDance was quietly rolling out Lemon8 in the U.S. and U.K. and had been paying creators to post on the app to seed its initial U.S. content. The influencers had shared with the news outlet the steps they needed to take to receive payment for their posts. It wouldn’t be surprising if some of these new, overly positive TikTok videos about Lemon8 were also a form of paid influencer marketing on ByteDance’s part. What makes us think that — beyond the timing, of course — has to do with the language the creators in the Insider story were using to describe Lemon8 — for example, calling it a mix of Pinterest and Instagram. Now, that exact same description is being regurgitated by the TikTok creators who are publishing these overly positive videos. In addition to the example quoted above, a scroll through videos matching a Lemon8 keyword search on TikTok has creators repeating the phrase “Pinterest meets Instagram” or “like Instagram and Pinterest had a baby,” while describing the app as “sooo cute.” None of the creators we found posting these positive reviews disclosed if they had been paid to publish their videos. After searching for the keyword “Lemon8” and then filtering for videos published in the last 24 hours, we encountered over 350 videos that matched the search term. A large number of them were positive reviews that push users to download the app. In fact, some creators even said they’re getting the app in case TikTok gets banned. Of course, Lemon8 may not be a viable backup plan for a TikTok ban, as lawmakers could consider a wide-ranging set of restrictions on Chinese tech, including on mobile applications far beyond TikTok alone. But ByteDance is not above leaning on creators to make its case — the company sent influencers to Washington ahead of last week’s congressional hearing to lobby on behalf of TikTok. But even beyond efforts with its direct involvement, a number of creators are frustrated with the national ban proposed by U.S. lawmakers — not to mention the clear lack of technical understanding demonstrated by the House reps questioning TikTok’s CEO. Currently, the Lemon8 hashtag has 2.3 billion views on TikTok; however, this includes a lot of non-U.S., non-English language content from over a larger period of time. The New York Times recently reported the #TikTokBan hashtag had grown to 1.7 billion views on TikTok as of yesterday, with many objecting to the ban."
33,Pinterest is testing new ways to shop in Shuffles collages,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 26, 2023","Pinterest is testing ways to integrate Shuffles collage content into Pinterest, starting with shopping. Shuffles, which is Pinterest’s collage-making app, launched to the general public last November. Now, the company is testing the integration of Shuffles shopping capabilities on the Pinterest platform. Shuffles will now have all of the shopping capabilities as regular pins. Users will be able to tap individual cutouts used in collages and see the brand, price, and other product metadata along with similar products to shop. Pinterest notes that unlike typical product exploration, Shuffles bring an interactivity that makes the experience fun. The company says Gen-Z is curating fresh, relevant content, which is quickly making for a marketplace of trendy, shoppable ideas. Pinterest believes the high-density nature of Shuffles, which can include layers of product cutouts from multiple Pins, allows consumers to dig deeper and also connect to other Shuffles that include the same Pins. “Pinterest makes online shopping feel natural and fun because it’s a core experience on the platform,” said Pinterest CEO Bill Ready in a statement. “As we continue to make it easier to shop what you see on Pinterest, we’re offering fresh new ways for consumers to browse, curate and discover products perfectly tailored to their taste.” Image Credits: Pinterest Image Credits: Pinterest Pinterest is also exploring a new takeover feature for advertisers called “Pinterest Premiere Spotlight” that prominently showcases a brand on search. The company says the feature is designed to give advertisers a new way to reach users on Pinterest. The company says 97% of top searches on Pinterest are unbranded, which means users typically don’t type a brand name into their searches on the platform. This gives brands the opportunity to be discovered as they help consumers go from discovery to decision to purchase, Pinterest says. In the coming months, the company plans to offer additional ways to help brands connect with shoppers. Pinterest also shared some new stats about its Catalogs offering, which lets brands upload their full catalog to the platform and turn their products into dynamic Product Pins. The company says it has seen a 66% increase in retailers setting up shop by uploading or integrating their digital catalogs on its platform, along with 70% growth in active shopping feeds year-over-year globally. As part of its most recent earnings release, Pinterest revealed that its platform now has 450 million monthly active users globally, a 4% jump year-on-year. Pinterest has been focused on enhancing the shopping experience on its platform over the past few years, and said during its earnings call that it wants to make every pin shoppable, including videos.

I’m excited to host a TechCrunch Live event with Persona co-founder and CEO Rick Song, one of the early movers in the space, about how his company identified ID management as an opportunity. This TechCrunch Live event takes place on Wednesday, May 10, 2023, at 12:00 p.m. PDT. Register here for Hopin access, where viewers can ask questions and network with other attendees. Along with Rick, Index Venture’s Mark Goldberg is speaking at the event, too. Mark made a prescient move to spot and back Persona during its Series B fundraise and backed the company again for its $150 million Series C. Rick Song co-founded Persona with Charles Yeh in 2018, and according to PitchBook, the company’s valuation is $1.5 billion as of Persona’s Series C in 2021. Since its founding, the company’s goal has remained the same: provide users with a verification system to protect and secure identity from theft and fraud. The company raised a Series B in 2021 after seeing revenues jump 20x while users increased 5x. In late 2022, Persona introduced new services, expanding beyond identify verification with the launch of à la carte tools, including a risk assessment engine, an identity workflow tool, a graph database aimed at link analysis and fraud detection, and a marketplace for external developers to help connect their business tools to Persona’s identity tools. I hope you can join this TechCrunch Live event. Rick and Mark are set to provide actionable insights on how companies can better protect users, and how founders, building such services, can stand out among their competitors.

35,Mark Cuban’s streaming platform Fireside confirms $25M Series A at $138M valuation,['@sarahintampa'],"April 26, 2023","Fireside, the Mark Cuban-backed interactive entertainment app, has now confirmed its $25 million Series A, valuing the business at $138 million, post-money. The company had been rumored to be raising at a $125 million valuation last year, after attracting a number of high-profile creators to its streaming platform for live and virtual shows. The funding and valuation were confirmed through Fireside’s recent investor update, obtained by TechCrunch, which also mentions new strategic investors like Paris Hilton and others, and offers a first look at its interactive streaming technology for smart TVs. The latter is made possible through last year’s acquisition of the streaming TV platform Stremium. At the time, Fireside confirmed the deal would help it to accelerate its plans, saying it would be the “only platform that turns creators, celebrities, brands and IP owners into the studio, networks and streaming services of the future.” The company hopes to soon bring its interactive technology to smart TVs, Fire TV, Apple TV and Roku, where viewers could watch content on the big screen and engage via their phone, while their comments would display on the TV. Image Credits: Fireside Image Credits: Fireside Reached for comment, Fireside confirmed the investor update’s accuracy but said it has nothing more to add at this time. The update confirms the earlier reporting that Fireside’s Series A had closed, which it had yet to officially announce. It also confirms the newly added strategic investors, including Paris Hilton, Tim Connors from PivotNorth, Zeke Bronfman + Evan Abraham, Redbeard Ventures and David DeVoe. Though Fireside had once been compared to other live platforms like Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse, those comparisons weren’t at all accurate. Not only does Fireside differentiate itself with its focus on streaming interactive videos, the shows on its platform can also be recorded, saved or even simulcast to other social networks. Plus, the app includes a number of audience engagement tools and other features to aid creators with promotion, editing, measurement, distribution, monetization and audience growth, which are part of its end-to-end content production experience. Co-founded by Cuban, early Yammer employee Mike Ihbe (who has since departed) and former Googler, YouTuber and Node co-founder Falon Fatemi, who sold her last company to SugarCRM, Fireside has attracted high-profile creators, including Jay Leno, Michael Dell, Melissa Rivers, Craig Kilborn and screenwriter and “Entourage” creator Doug Ellin. In the investor update, the company also references popular Hollywood medium Tyler Henry as one of its creators, saying his network has grown to “tens of thousands of members globally” who connect with him “multiple times per month.” The startup is also going to have a Hollywood moment of its own, as reality TV star Heather Dubrow from Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Orange County will launch a lifestyle network, the HD Network, on Fireside on May 9. That’s given Fireside a bit of a promotion as part of The Real Housewives of Orange County Season 17, where both Fatemi and Cuban will appear. Also thanks to its integration with Stremium, Fireside will be onboarding other partners to its platform. The deal brings “over 100 new networks” with “24/7 broadcasting live interactive programming.” This includes names like USA Today, ArtFlix Movie Classics, Billiard, Boxing, Ted Talks, Docurama, English Football, eSports, Global Fashion Channel, InspireFlix, Law & Crime, MMA and others. These channels will have an “On Now” indicator in the Fireside app, allowing users to watch alongside other audience members and react and comment. Image Credits: Fireside Image Credits: Fireside This technology is something that’s been popular in other streaming apps outside the U.S., like Rakuten’s Viki, which allows users to watch and react to shows in real time. More recently, a new streaming service Mansa, focused on Black culture, added a similar feature. The investor update also mentioned that talent, brands and IP owners can make a minimum of $35 million in annual recurring net new revenue stream in their first year on Fireside. The company said it’s now seeing a “minimum of $100K” within the first hours of a stream’s launch. It didn’t provide a source for this data or speak to how many streams were able to achieve these figures.  Fireside previously tested monetization by allowing creators to sell tickets or insert advertising. The company had also explored web3 technologies, like NFTs — though those were not referenced in this latest update. The company now focuses on having creators sell subscriptions.  In addition to Cuban himself, other investors in Fireside include the Chainsmokers, HBSE, Goodwater, Animal Capital, NFL stars Larry Fitzgerald (retired) and Kelvin Beachum, and former NBA star Baron Davis. The company says it’s aiming to reach profitability this year and is being evaluated for a Series B where it will look to include international strategic investors in order to expand globally.  "
36,"Orb, which helps B2B companies price their products, raises $19.1M",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 29, 2023","Alvaro Morales and Kshitij Grover were working together as engineering leaders at Asana for five years, during a time when the company underwent major changes to pricing and packaging. The initiatives were painful for both the engineering and finance departments, they say — which is when the pair realized that they wanted more flexibility over how software-as-a-service (SaaS) products were billed and monetized. “We found it counterintuitive that billing tools often constrain and dictate what teams can try out,” Morales told TechCrunch in an email interview. “They should, instead, enable the flexibility to meet customers where they are.” To achieve this flexibility (or at least try), Morales and Grover co-founded Orb, a pricing platform that helps companies automate a range of different billing types — usage-based, subscriptions or a mix of both. Orb today revealed that it’s raised $19.1 million across Series A ($14 million led by Menlo) and seed ($5.1 million led by Greylock) rounds to date, which Morales says is being put toward customer acquisition, go-to-market and R&D efforts. “The trend towards usage-based pricing has accelerated in recent years, and so has the hype around it. [But] there’s no one-size-fits all approach to pricing,” Morales, who serves as CEO, said. “We like to think of Orb as marrying an analytics product and a billing product to create a new approach that provides flexibility and enables experimentation. Orb gives companies a single source of truth that can connect every unit of product usage to revenue.” To Morales’ earlier point, it’s true, certainly, that more SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based pricing. In a 2021 survey from OpenView, 45% of SaaS companies said that they’re using usage-based pricing, up from 34% in 2020. Twilio, Strip and Plaid are among big middleware companies charging by usage, while Shopify, Slack and HubSpot are among the major application companies that have opted for the model. Orb handles a range of billing tasks, including collecting and metering product usage data, invoicing customers and generating revenue reports. Within the platform, users can model out alternative pricing plans and orchestrate changes in real time, drawing on product usage insights to find revenue opportunities. Orb’s pricing engine provides tools to test new strategies and analyze usage data. Image Credits: Orb Orb’s pricing engine provides tools to test new strategies and analyze usage data. Image Credits: Orb Orb can be used to schedule future price changes for customer cohorts or contract renewals. Meanwhile, on the invoicing side, it lets companies directly embed draft invoices into product billing portals — surfacing past-due invoices and attempting to recover failed payments automatically. “Orb gives companies the control and flexibility to monetize with any pricing model, without the cost of building it in-house,” Morales said. “We aim to have pricing move at the pace of product innovation.” Orb competes with several other players in the SaaS billing automation space, like Zenskar, which offers a platform for companies to generate bills for a variety of different pricing plans. There’s also Metronome, a startup developing billing and data infrastructure to process data at scale, and m3ter, which focuses on usage-based customer scenarios. For its part, Orb, which publicly launched today, claims to have high-profile customers, including Airbyte, Dune and Materialize. Morales wouldn’t reveal the size of Orb’s customer base or any revenue figures, but — evidently anticipating growth — he said that Orb plans to double its 14-person workforce by the end of the year. “There are players who have emerged as point solutions that specialize in usage-based metering, but point solutions present an operational challenge because revenue data gets fragmented across multiple systems,” Morales continued. “The end users include the multiple stakeholders at each company who touch pricing and billing, with engineers, product managers, revops, and finance controllers using Orb actively to drive business decisions.” Saam Motamedi, a general partner at Greylock who led Orb’s seed round, had this to add via email: “SaaS companies must drive sustainable and profitable growth and need solutions that deliver value without requiring additional seats or active usage. When combined with the AI- and machine learning-driven automation revolution, cloud economics are in a state of rapid flux. The speed with which software businesses can evolve monetization will differentiate the winners. We see Orb as a key to unlocking the value for the next major wave in software.” San Francisco–based Orb’s other investors include base case capital, Scribble Ventures, South Park Commons, FOG Ventures, Essence VC, Data Community Fund, the Cannon Project and SV Angel, as well as individual angel backers."
37,Lyft layoffs to affect 26% of workforce,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 27, 2023","Lyft said Thursday it will cut 26% of its workforce, or about 1,072 people, as part of a restructuring plan aimed at rebuilding its core ride-hailing product and boosting profits. The company also said in a regulatory filing Thursday that it decided to scale back hiring plans and will eliminate 250 open job positions. Last week, Lyft’s newly appointed CEO David Risher told employees in an email that the company would significantly reduce its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. Risher said the restructuring would be part of Lyft’s plan to “better meeting the needs of riders and drivers.” With an emphasis on ride-hailing, workers and industry watchers have speculated other departments such as its bike-sharing service will sustain the deepest cuts. Lyft did not disclose if the layoffs would focus on certain departments. Lyft is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings results May 4."
38,Google’s free Assured Open Source Software service hits GA,['@fredericl'],"April 12, 2023","About a year ago, Google announced its Assured Open Source Software (Assured OSS) service, a service that helps developers defend against supply chain security attacks by regularly scanning and analyzing for vulnerabilities some of the world’s most popular software libraries. Today, Google is launching Assured OSS into general availability with support for well over a thousand Java and Python packages — and while Google didn’t initially disclose pricing when it first announced the service, the company has now revealed that it will be available for free. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google Software development has long depended on third-party libraries (which are often maintained by only a single developer), but it wasn’t until the industry got hit with a number of high-profile exploits that everyone (including the White House) perked up and started taking software supply chain security seriously. Now, you can’t attend an open source conference without hearing about Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), artifact registries and similar topics. It’s no surprise then that Google, which has long been at the forefront of releasing open-source products, launched a service like Assured OSS. Google promises that it will constantly keep these libraries up to date (without creating forks) and continuously scan for known vulnerabilities, do fuzz tests to discover new ones and then fix these issues and contribute these fixes back upstream. The company notes that when it first launched the service with around 250 Java libraries, it was responsible for discovering 48% of the new CVEs for these libraries and subsequently addressing them. “As organizations increasingly utilize OSS for faster development cycles, they need trusted sources of secure open source packages,” said Melinda Marks, senior analyst, ESG. “Without proper vetting and verification or metadata to help track OSS access and usage, organizations risk exposure to potential security vulnerabilities and other risks in their software supply chain. By partnering with a trusted supplier, organizations can mitigate these risks and ensure the integrity of their software supply chain to better protect their business applications.” Developers and organizations that want to use the new service can sign up here and then integrate Assured OSS into their existing development pipeline.

39,Have startup valuations fallen enough to feel sane again?,['@alex'],"April 10, 2023","Welcome to the new week. While recording Equity this morning, I noted with surprise an interesting bit of data that got me wondering about the current premium that venture investors are paying for startup shares, and if we can see anything new compared to 2022 data, especially given that complaints about YC startup prices are once again news. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. What follows is a somewhat numerate consolidation of several pieces that The Exchange put out last week. Read on if you have a minute and a fresh coffee, and thank you as always for your patience. One way to think about startup valuations is to bucket them by their venture stage, using median results to create a mental market map. To pick a recent example, Carta bucketed median pre-money valuations for Series A, B and C startups into $40 million, $90 million, and $173 million buckets, respectively. Each figure is down from recent highs: $49.4 million for Series A in Q1 2022; $161 million for Series B in Q1 2022; and a staggering $416 million for Series C rounds in Q2 2021. Those valuations, however, are imperfect. First, Carta doesn’t have insight into every deal out there, as it can only see the ones that its startup customers raise, so there’s some very understandable data completeness issues in its very useful dataset. Second, just looking at the sticker price isn’t enough. We need more data than just the trailing median price range to really understand how startup valuations are earned. Why do we need all that data? We also want to know what the startups in those Series buckets have under the hood: the why behind the what. That’s why Point Nine Capital’s SaaS napkins, which provide time-bounded data on the inputs that yield the valuations, have become a staple for us data nerds who track the startup fundraising game. And the historical record of SaaS napkins — basically all the data concerning software startup fundraising that can fit on a small piece of paper — lets us compare and contrast norms across time. It’s helpful."
40,Missouri trans ‘snitch form’ down after people spammed it with the ‘Bee Movie’ script,['@morgan_sung'],"April 21, 2023","A Missouri government tip site for submitting complaints and concerns about gender-affirming care is down after people flooded it with fanfiction, rambling anecdotes and the “Bee Movie” script. The Missouri Attorney General’s office launched an online form for “Transgender Center Concerns” in late March, inviting those who’ve witnessed “troubling practices” at clinics that provide gender-affirming care to submit tips. The site didn’t ask users to name patients or healthcare providers, but encouraged users to complete the form “in as much detail as possible.” Before the form was taken down, people spammed it with raunchy fanfiction and rambling anecdotes. Image Credits: Missouri Attorney General (screenshot) Before the form was taken down, people spammed it with raunchy fanfiction and rambling anecdotes. Image Credits: Missouri Attorney General (screenshot) But after days of TikTok and Twitter users spamming the site with gibberish, the tip line has been removed from the Missouri government site entirely. Instead of the online form, the link to the tip line now says that the page no longer exists. Madeline Sieren, press secretary for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, blamed “far left activists” for breaking the site. She said the tip line is down temporarily. “Rather than standing on their supposed science to back up their facts, they’re resorting to trying to hack our system to silence victims of the exact network we’re attempting to expose,” Sieren told TechCrunch in an email. “In order to ensure the integrity of a government website, the page is temporarily down while we investigate these matters.”  Sieren did not clarify what the “hack” entailed.  Bailey said his office set up the tip line for parents to submit concerns about the gender-affirming care their children received from transgender youth centers. He also issued an emergency rule severely restricting access to gender-affirming care.   PROMO, a Missouri LGBTQ advocacy organization, said Bailey “fanned the flames of hate” in issuing the emergency rule.  “The Attorney General’s claims are maliciously cherry-picked and come from unverified sources that allow him to promulgate disgusting, obstructive, and misleading information into an emergency rule,” PROMO said in a statement. “It should be clear to anyone paying attention that the real threat to Missourians is the attorney general himself.” Social media users on TikTok, Twitter and Tumblr ensured that Bailey’s office would have plenty of evidence to sift through for the investigation, flooding the site with fake complaints and other ephemera. When the online form first launched, it lacked a CAPTCHA, which savvy Twitter users quickly used to their advantage by using bots to spam the site. Users also employed a generator to churn out fake names and fake Missouri addresses. Others just dumped text into the complaint form, ranging from the entire script of the “Bee Movie,” to Billy May’s OxiClean sales pitch, to Walter White’s introductory monologue in “Breaking Bad.” TikTok users said they submitted the “most raunchiest fanfic from AO3” and “a saucy love story of Mario and Luigi.”  an honest mistake!!!🏳️‍⚧️ #greenscreen #softscorpio #transrights #missouri ♬ Original Mii Channel Theme – VideoGameOST  “I knew those weird fanfics I read at 3am would come in handy,” one TikTok commenter said.   Many submitted elaborate anecdotes of woke moms taking their kids “to the corner gender clinic to get transed” and complaints of “too many men getting gender affirming care via viagra.” Another tip referencing “The Crucible” joked, “I saw goody proctor injecting estrogen with the devil.” The tip form added a CAPTCHA on Thursday, but that alone wasn’t enough to deter the trolls. The form was removed from the attorney general’s site by Friday morning.  Spamming tip forms, colloquially referred to by detractors as “snitch lines,” isn’t new. Texas’ abortion whistleblower site was shut down in 2021 after activists flooded it with Shrek porn. Amid mass protests following the death of George Floyd in 2020, activists spammed law enforcement agency tip lines with K-pop fancams and videos of police brutality against protestors. Relentless trolling has become a form of protest against draconian surveillance. pic.twitter.com/dY7AVTFhE8 — 𝙟𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙚 𝙬𝙚 𝙣𝙚𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙤 𝙘𝙤𝙤𝙠 (@notthediz) April 19, 2023  The tip line is part of a larger “investigation” that Missouri’s attorney general is using to target the state’s trans community. Earlier this month, Bailey announced an emergency directive that severely restricts access to gender-affirming care in the state. The new restrictions, which will go into effect on April 27, will require patients to attend 15 sessions of therapy over the course of 18 months before they can receive puberty blockers, hormonal medication or gender-affirming surgery. In the emergency ruling, Bailey referenced the state’s consumer protection law, and claimed that he is “charged with protecting consumers, including minors, from harm.” The emergency rule cited a disputed whistleblower report alleging that a transgender youth center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital rushed patients into gender-affirming care without informed consent. The ACLU of Missouri argues that Bailey’s emergency rule is based on debunked claims, not scientific evidence.  “Gender-affirming care is critical in helping transgender adolescents succeed in school, establish healthy relationships with their friends and family, live authentically as themselves, and dream about their futures,” the ACLU of Missouri tweeted. “This emergency regulation will have a drastically negative impact on transgender youth, compounding the prejudice, discrimination, violence, and other forms of stigma they continue to face in their daily lives.”"
41,What the new EPA tailpipe regulations mean for investors,['@tdechant'],"April 14, 2023","If there was any question as to whether the Biden administration is serious about the electrification of the U.S. economy, this week’s announcement of new automotive emissions regulations should put that to rest — along with any doubts investors have about where they should direct their investments. The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing new rules that would take effect in 2027 and pave the way for a new vehicle market dominated by EVs. By 2032, two-thirds of car and light truck sales will have to be zero emitting along with 46% of medium-duty vehicles like delivery vans, half of all buses and one-quarter of all heavy-duty trucks. The regulations are technology agnostic, meaning that green hydrogen vehicles would qualify, but in reality, the vast majority of those sales will be battery powered. The climate impacts promise to be significant. Just the light-duty emissions limits alone will slash 15.5% of U.S. carbon pollution, the EPA estimates. The new regulations set targets that are significantly more stringent than those put forth in Biden’s 2021 executive order, which calls for 50% of light-duty vehicles to be electric by 2030. The other difference is the relative stickiness of the two. Executive orders can be easily rescinded by future administrations. EPA regulations, though, are harder to roll back once they’ve been implemented. States’ attorneys general and future administrations might try to sue or scale them back, but well-written, already implemented regulations are much harder to overturn. The EPA was no doubt emboldened by actions taken in recent years by states and other countries to ban fossil fuel vehicles in the not-so-distant future. By 2035, polluting light-duty vehicles will be banned in several U.S. states and at least 20 countries, representing 25% of worldwide light-duty vehicle sales. (The agency literally devotes two paragraphs of the proposal to the trend.) In other words, automakers have to be prepared regardless of what the EPA does. So why not make the move now so they have more certainty and are better positioned for success?"
42,"Alibaba Cloud, Avalanche partner to deploy metaverses on the blockchain",['@jacqmelinek'],"May 4, 2023","Alibaba Cloud, the digital technology and intelligence division of Alibaba Group, has partnered with layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, the companies exclusively told TechCrunch ahead of an announcement at the Avalanche Summit II conference. The partnership will provide Alibaba’s clients with a launchpad, Cloudverse, that aims to help businesses customize, launch and maintain their own metaverse spaces on Avalanche’s blockchain. There’s also a third partner, MUA DAO, which is the service layer that will help implement the integration and customization for metaverses, John Wu, president of Ava Labs, told TechCrunch. “For [Alibaba Cloud], their partners are asking to be a part of web3,” Wu said. “So we will be dedicating resources to make it easy for them to make their own SDKs on top of ours.” Avalanche has subnets, short for “subnetworks,” which are a set of nodes (or validators) that can be built on top of the blockchain. Subnets are application-specific blockchains that can be customized to fit one’s needs on top of a blockchain. This infrastructure will also aim to help create customizable blockchain solutions through the Cloudverse. The ability to launch metaverses quickly and easily could open doors for enterprises that don’t have the time or resources to launch these platforms, but want exposure to the space. “You and I can create a metaverse right now. Within 15 minutes, the chain is up; within hours the wallet is up and the turnkey is up,” Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of Ava Labs, said. The technology has been made “very easy” and all of the tools are open source, he added. Builders on the Cloudverse will receive support for visuals, metaeconomics, interactive functions, events, continued operations and more, the companies said. Each metaverse space can be ready for business in about a month after initial outreach, they added. This isn’t the first time the two organizations have gotten together. In December, Alibaba Cloud began providing infrastructure and tools to help Asia-based users launch validators on the Avalanche network. That original iteration provided plug-and-play and node-as-a-service initiatives to help expand blockchain adoption in Asia, the companies said. Alibaba Cloud has about 4 million customers and 10 million developers, according to John Wu, president of Ava Labs. “It’s a great way for Asian users to manage and validate nodes, and now we’re extending this partnership with Cloudverse.” From Alibaba’s perspective, one of the ways to get the Asian enterprise ecosystem into web3 is through the metaverse, Wu said. “For us, it’s a great way to get access to 4 million potential builders, and when they come through [Avalanche], there will be tons of transactions on the chain.”"
43,"Autotech Ventures’ new $230M mobility fund adds fintech, circular economy to its investment strategy",['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 20, 2023","Autotech Ventures will use its newly closed $230 million fund to expand beyond its foundation of early-stage ground transportation startups and invest in what the firm believes are the next big opportunities in automotive and mobility. Fintech, logistics, supply chain and the circular economy are at the top of the list. The $230 million fund, its third since launching in 2017, will be used to invest in seed through Series C mobility-related startups, according to the company. A mixture of financial and corporate LPs, including Allison Transmission, American Axle, Iochpe-Maxion and Shell participated in the fund. “We’re still a ground transportation-focused firm and we have a very similar strategy [with this fund],” Alexei Andreev, Autotech Ventures managing director told TechCrunch. “On a high-level, it’s same as Fund 1 and Fund 2. However, one of the fastest areas of growth is SaaS-enabled fintech. Auto commerce is inefficient and there are large pockets of profit to capture.” The firm is particularly interested in transportation-related fintech ventures that are poised to grow during a recession. “We made a prediction that sooner or later there will be a recession and we identified areas that benefit when the economy softens, Andreev said, noting that this latest fund invested in Yendo, a Dallas-based startup (formerly known as Otto) that lets customers borrow against their vehicles at the same interest rate as standard credit cards. Autotech Ventures’ previous fintech investments include U.K.-based buy now, pay later startup Bumper and Carpay, a buy here, pay here loan servicing SaaS platform for car dealers. Andreev said the firm is also investigating investment opportunities in the circular economy, a nascent industry focused on finding ways to reuse materials and products. Circular economy startups have garnered an increasing amount of attention and investment as automakers transition away from gas-powered vehicles and towards EVs. Autotech Ventures is also cautiously wading into generative AI, although Andreev was quick to note that the company has not made any investments in that area. Autotech has more than $500 million under management and has invested in more than 40 companies. Some of the firm’s investments include computer vision startup DeepScale (which was acquired by Tesla), Lyft, used vehicle marketplace operator Frontier Car Group, Drover, Outdoorsy, Swvl, parking app SpotHero and Xnor.ai, which Apple acquired in January 2020. Five of those startups have gone public, including indie Semiconductor and Volta Charging."
44,"Lucid to lay off 1,300 employees in restructuring",['@kirstenkorosec'],"March 28, 2023","Lucid Group, the U.S. automaker that produces the luxury all-electric Air sedan, is cutting its workforce by 18% as part of a restructuring, the company disclosed in a regulatory filing. The layoffs, which will affect 1,300 employees, will be completed by the end of the second quarter. Lucid expects to incur about $24 million to $30 million in charges connected with its restructuring plan, namely due to severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. The layoffs will be across the organization and will include executive positions. CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson said in an email to workers that the restructuring is the result of its “evolving business needs and productivity improvements.” He said the move is aligned with a cost-reduction announcement made in late February. While the company has reduced costs, it was not enough to avoid layoffs, according to the email. “Consequently, we’ve made the painful but necessary decision to let some of our talented team members go,” Rawlinson wrote, adding that impacted employees will be offered a severance package that includes access to career resources, Lucid-paid healthcare coverage continuation and acceleration of equity. “We are also taking continued steps to manage our costs by reviewing all non-critical spending at this time,” he wrote. Rawlinson said the decisions are designed to position the company to be “more resilient and agile” and strengthen the company for the long-term. He also said that Lucid still intends to launch the Gravity SUV in 2024. Last month, Lucid reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings that missed Wall Street expectations. The company also lowered its 2023 annual production target to 10,000 to 14,000, roughly half of the 20,000 to 22,000 deliveries analysts had expected for the year. That was the third time in a year that the company lowered its production goals. In August, Lucid Motors slashed its annual production guidance in half due to what Rawlinson described as “extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges.” Lucid lowered its production guidance from 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles to 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles for 2022. That’s just a quarter of the 20,000 luxury Air sedans the company initially planned to produce in 2022. In February 2022, Lucid adjusted that loftier goal down to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles."
45,Why Halo is betting on a remote-operated car-sharing service,['@strngwys'],"May 5, 2023","Driverless cars are often marketed as a safe and convenient means of travel that allows customers to watch movies, scroll through TikTok or nap — all without worrying about taking over control. Whether it’s in a personal vehicle (which to remind everyone, there are currently no personal autonomous cars for sale) or ride-hailing service like Cruise or Waymo, the big sales pitch is you don’t have to drive. Halo has a different approach. The Las Vegas car-sharing startup is working toward fleet vehicle autonomy. The rub is that customers will not have access to self-driving features. Instead, the technology is only being used as a valet service for people looking for a short-term rental. Halo is like Car2go, ZipCar, Gig Share and other car-sharing services with the extra benefit of the vehicle being delivered to a customer’s destination via a teleoperations system that lets a human pilot the vehicle through city streets from a remote location. Image Credits: Halo Image Credits: Halo Well, eventually. Currently, most vehicles in the fleet are being delivered to customers by human drivers. But the company is testing its remote-driver system with a small subset of vehicles in Vegas and hopes to expand that pilot to customers in June or July of this year. (The company had previously planned to remove the human safety operator from behind the wheel and only use its remote driver system by the end of 2022.) To handle human-free (sort-of) deployments Halo has built its own remote driving system. A person back at the office pilots a vehicle in a rig similar to what high-end iRig gamers use but with a real car at the other end that has a top speed of 25 miles per hour. Self-driving vehicles have been the core of many failed endeavors. One of the largest disasters was when Uber invested heavily in the technology before eventually selling off its autonomous division to Aurora. Autonomous Ubers were supposed to be the path to profitability for the company. Instead, it proved too difficult and costly. Halo CEO founder Anand Nandakumar is under no illusion that the tech is right around the corner. “What I found was autonomous (technology) is going to take another 15 years to be commercially ready as a real, commercial-ready viable product,” Nandakumar told TechCrunch. Delivering EVs to customers is less about showcasing what the company can do and more about streamlining the business over the long term. Currently, a driver handles about four to five in-person deliveries a day. Once these drivers go remote, that number jumps to 10 deliveries a day. The idea is that Halo will lose money while delivering the vehicle, but then recoup those losses and more when the customer drives the car around for $12 an hour. That’s cheaper than offerings from Uber or Lyft and delivery times should be on par with those ride-hailing services. By distributing its vehicles around a metropolitan area (in partnership with local authorities) Halo aims to deliver a car to a customer in six to seven minutes. After that, “the car is kept by the customer for several hours. So we make a good chunk of margin in the time the customer keeps the car,” Nandakumar said. At that point, the vehicle can be remotely navigated to where it’s needed next or deployed to a parking space. In the future, to bring Halo even closer to ride-hailing services it hopes to introduce one-way rentals. Currently, all rentals are round trip. Delivery and pick-up happen in the same location. Picking up the vehicle in one spot and dropping it off at another means the customers don’t need to find parking. They can theoretically just get out of the car and let it drive off on its own. “What we’re saying is people don’t mind driving their own cars,” Nandakumar said. Halo is attempting to grow while avoiding some of the pitfalls — like runaway costs and parking restrictions — that have plagued other ride-hailing and car-sharing companies. Nandakumar notes that the company has been running lean since its inception four years ago. They have a small crew and instead of expanding quickly, Halo has been laser-focused on making sure what they’re selling works well in Las Vegas. The remotely piloted vehicles will be deployed in downtown Vegas with a small fleet. Nandakumar believes Halo can launch with a fleet that’s 1/10th the size of what a traditional car-sharing company needs. It’s also working closely with the city to secure parking spaces — a seemingly small but critical detail that has upended the ambitions of car-sharing companies in the other cities. And don’t expect Halo to evolve into a self-driving ride-hailing service. The company’s revenue comes from customers driving the vehicle on their own. Nandakumar notes that a robotaxi business plan wouldn’t be profitable. Instead, the self-driving and remote-driving tech can be used to move the vehicles remotely around the city for optimal deployment. A quick ride in one of the company’s remotely piloted Kia Niro EVs is mostly uneventful. Sitting behind the wheel communicating with the actual driver in Las Vegas, Nandakumar only takes control once to navigate around a bollard. With a self-imposed top speed of 25 miles-per-hour for all remotely piloted vehicles, it’s a mostly very slow, very boring experience. The EV itself is outfitted with six cameras mounted to the roof delivering a 360-degree view of the world. The front of the vehicle uses five cameras for a 210-degree view of the world. Essentially, the remote driver can see more of the world than the people inside the SUV. Everything is bolted on including the antennas from three of the major cellular networks. The idea is to have network redundancy. If one connection goes dark, there are two more to fall back on. Halo has also partnered with T-Mobile to give the vehicles higher-priority access to the carrier’s network. This should — in theory — help keep the vehicles running during moments of high network usage. Halo plans on adding the Chevy Bolt to the fleet. Of course, it’ll need to hurry since GM has decided to end production of that vehicle at the end of the year. As for future vehicles, Nandakumar talks about adding EV pickups. Most people only need the hauling capability of a truck for a few hours, he mused. Why not offer them one that’s delivered to their house and then drives away after the trip to Home Depot? What’s really interesting is that all these hardware additions to the vehicle can be removed. No wires are cut, and there’s no drilling involved. Essentially Halo’s EVs can be returned to their original condition without much fuss, allowing Halo to sell the vehicles when they’re done with them. Another way in which Halo is being fiscally responsible in a highly volatile market. All of these car-related businesses have been a gamble. Halo’s approach is using what works now instead of waiting for what’s on the horizon. Plus, if you’re going to gamble on car-sharing, it might as well happen in Vegas."
46,Hex lands another $28M as data collaboration platform continues to gain traction,['@ron_miller'],"March 23, 2023","Many companies are struggling to get funding these days in an increasingly tight investment environment. It seems the days are gone when VC firms approach promising startups about funding instead of the other way around, but Hex, a data collaboration startup, has defied the odds. Company co-founder and CEO Barry McCardel says he wasn’t looking for funding when Sequoia came knocking on his door. The company ended up landing another $28 million from Sequoia, with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify and Snowflake. McCardel says he still hasn’t touched the $52 million he had in the bank from his previous funding round last year. “We weren’t raising, and didn’t need the money — we hadn’t touched a dime of the last round. But Matt Miller at Sequoia approached us preemptively with an offer that gave us very little dilution, and let us put another 2-3 years of runway in the bank,” McCardel told TechCrunch. “This felt like a no-brainer coming into a time when we want to be investing deeply in our product and team, especially around the AI opportunity,” he said. One of the reasons for the investor interest is that the company has been growing at a rapid clip since its funding last year. “We’ve been on a tear. I think from a top line business perspective, we’ve grown revenue by 4x and the size of the business by 4x in one year, which has been great. We 10xed our user base because we launched a tier that just opened up access to a ton more people.” “So just the raw number of people using the product in the last year has been great. And I think that obviously caught the eye of new investors,” he said. The company now has 450 paying customers including Brex, Notion, Toast and Chegg. He believes that the collaborative approach to data and the growing recognition that AI is transforming workflows are the biggest reasons for the product’s growing popularity. Most recently, the company added a tool called Hex Magic, a generative AI approach to interacting with the data with plain language by asking questions about the data, or asking Hex to undertake a task like auto-completing a join, and the software responds to the requests. He sees this as a way to expand the user base beyond folks like data scientists and people who know SQL or Python. “Our product uniquely allows collaboration across different data personas. I think that’s also really powerful. And I think the AI stuff is just accretive to that. You don’t necessarily have to know how to write the perfect syntax in Python to do something because Hex can help you do that. So I think that’s a pretty powerful thing that we’ll just see become more and more important in terms of opening up [the platform] to more people,” he said. Hex was founded in 2019 and has now raised more than $100 million dollars in just four years, per Crunchbase data. With the most recent round of funding. McCardel says he should have five years of runway, setting his company up to ride out whatever economic uncertainty may be out there, while giving him the freedom to grow the platform as needed."

The hope was to avoid the problems of iOS 16, an ambitious update that suffered from missed deadlines and a buggy start. But later in the development process, the strategy changed. The iOS 17 release is now expected to boast several “nice to have” features, even if it lacks a tentpole improvement like last year’s revamped lock screen. The goal of the software, codenamed “Dawn,” is to check off several of users’ most requested features. It’s possible that Apple may allow sideloading apps with iOS 17, which means users wouldn’t be dependent on the App Store for app downloads. A Bloomberg report from last December revealed that Apple was preparing to allow alternative app stores on its iPhones and iPads in order to comply with European Union requirements coming in 2024. As with Apple’s previous software updates, iOS 17 will likely be revealed at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, alongside Apple’s other OS versions like watchOS 10, tvOS 17 and macOS 14. Apple is also expected to unveil its long-awaited mixed-reality headset at WWDC. Gurman says Apple internally demoed the headset to Apple executives at Steve Jobs Theater last week, which suggests that a public unveiling of the product could be coming soon. The new device could look like a pair of ski goggles, based on a report from The Information. It will feature several cameras so that the device can track your movements in real time and see what’s happening in the real world.  "
49,Opera launches Opera One browser with a new tab grouping concept,['@indianidle'],"April 25, 2023","Opera has launched a new browser called Opera One, which will eventually replace its flagship browser. The Norway-based company said that this new browser has elements that will make it ready for a “generative AI-based future” without specifying what it means. The core feature for Opera One, which is being launched as a developer preview, is a new tab grouping concept called “Tab Islands.” It automatically groups tabs based on context. For instance, if you are looking for dinner places, tabs with different menus and locations will be clubbed together. If you are working on a bunch of Google docs, they will be grouped together as well. Tab Island representation. Image Credits: TechCrunch Tab Island representation. Image Credits: TechCrunch Each island (or group) is represented by a vertical colored pill, which you can expand and collapse with a click. There is a handy tooltip feature for collapsed islands, which can help you find the correct tab group. Joanna Czajka, product director at Opera, said that this new approach is “a natural way of arranging your tabs into contextual groups without disturbing your flow.” However, Opera is not the only browser maker trying to approach tabs in a new way. Startups like the Browser Company and SigmaOS have focused on creating different workspaces and opening/finding tabs through a taskbar. The company added that Opera One uses Multithreaded Compositor, which helps in rendering different complex web animations smoothly through the GPU. Czajka said that this helps in better performance with tab island and other upcoming features like a redesigned address bar. In terms of AI-centric features for the new browser, Opera didn’t give many details. But specified that ChatGPT and ChatSonic integrations it introduced to the flagship browser in March will be turned on by default. Opera said that this is the first iteration of Opera One, and later this year it will replace the company’s flagship product on Windows, MacOS, and Linux."
50,We all contribute to AI — should we get paid for that?,['@cookie'],"April 21, 2023","In Silicon Valley, some of the brightest minds believe a universal basic income (UBI) that guarantees people unrestricted cash payments will help them to survive and thrive as advanced technologies eliminate more careers as we know them, from white-collar and creative jobs — lawyers, journalists, artists, software engineers — to labor roles. The idea has gained enough traction that dozens of guaranteed income programs have been started in U.S. cities since 2020. Yet even Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and one of the highest-profile proponents of UBI, doesn’t believe that it’s a complete solution. As he said during a sit-down earlier this year, “I think it is a little part of the solution. I think it’s great. I think as [advanced artificial intelligence] participates more and more in the economy, we should distribute wealth and resources much more than we have and that will be important over time. But I don’t think that’s going to solve the problem. I don’t think that’s going to give people meaning, I don’t think it means people are going to entirely stop trying to create and do new things and whatever else. So I would consider it an enabling technology, but not a plan for society.” The question begged is what a plan for society should then look like, and computer scientist Jaron Lanier, a founder in the field of virtual reality, writes in this week’s New Yorker that “data dignity” could be an even bigger part of the solution. Here’s the basic premise: Right now, we mostly give our data for free in exchange for free services. Lanier argues that in the age of AI, we need to stop doing this, that the powerful models currently working their way into society need instead to “be connected with the humans” who give them so much to ingest and learn from in the first place. The idea is for people to “get paid for what they create, even when it is filtered and recombined” into something that’s unrecognizable. The concept isn’t brand new, with Lanier first introducing the notion of data dignity in a 2018 Harvard Business Review piece titled, “A Blueprint for a Better Digital Society.” As he wrote at the time with co-author and economist Glen Weyl, “[R]hetoric from the tech sector suggests a coming wave of underemployment due to artificial intelligence (AI) and automation.” But the predictions of UBI advocates “leave room for only two outcomes,” and they’re extreme, Lanier and Weyl observed. “Either there will be mass poverty despite technological advances, or much wealth will have to be taken under central, national control through a social wealth fund to provide citizens a universal basic income.” The problem is that both “hyper-concentrate power and undermine or ignore the value of data creators,” they wrote. Of course, assigning people the right amount of credit for their countless contributions to everything that exists online is not a minor challenge. Lanier acknowledges that even data-dignity researchers can’t agree on how to disentangle everything that AI models have absorbed or how detailed an accounting should be attempted. Still, Lanier thinks that it could be done — gradually. Alas, even if there is a will, a more immediate challenge — lack of access — is a lot to overcome. Though OpenAI had released some of its training data in previous years, it has since closed the kimono completely, citing competitive and safety concerns. When OpenAI President Greg Brockman described to TechCrunch last month the training data for OpenAI’s latest and most powerful large language model, GPT-4, he said it derived from a “variety of licensed, created, and publicly available data sources, which may include publicly available personal information,” but he declined to offer anything more specific. Unsurprisingly, regulators are grappling with what to do. OpenAI — whose technology in particular is spreading like wildfire — is already in the crosshairs of a growing number of countries, including the Italian authority, which has blocked the use of its popular ChatGPT chatbot. French, German, Irish and Canadian data regulators are also investigating how it collects and uses data. Margaret Mitchell, an AI researcher who was formerly Google’s AI ethics co-lead, tells the outlet Technology Review that it might be nearly impossible at this point for all these companies to identify individuals’ data and remove it from their models. As explained by the outlet: OpenAI would be better off today if it had built in data record-keeping from the start, but it’s standard in the AI industry to build datasets for AI models by scraping the web indiscriminately and then outsourcing some of the clean-up of that data. If these players have a limited understanding of what’s now in their models, that’s a daunting challenge to the “data dignity” proposal of Lanier. Whether it renders it impossible is something only time will tell. Certainly, there is merit in determining some way to give people ownership over their work, even if that work is made outwardly “other” by the time a large language model has chewed through it. It’s also highly likely that frustration over who owns what will grow as more of the world is reshaped by these new tools. Already, OpenAI and others are facing numerous and wide-ranging copyright infringement lawsuits over whether or not they have the right to scrape the entire internet to feed their algorithms. Either way, it’s not just about giving credit where it’s due; recognizing people’s contribution to AI systems may be necessary to preserve humans’ sanity over time, suggests Lanier in his New Yorker piece. He believes that people need agency, and as he sees it, universal basic income “amounts to putting everyone on the dole in order to preserve the idea of black-box artificial intelligence.” Meanwhile, ending the “black box nature of our current AI models” would make an accounting of people’s contributions easier — which would make them more inclined to stay engaged and continue making contributions. It might all boil down to establishing a new creative class instead of a new dependent class, he writes. And which would you prefer to be a part of?"

The new redesign moves the navigation to the left side with options for TV, Movies and My Stuff. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the updated interface began rolling yesterday. It will be available across all supported connected TV devices in the coming months, including Android TV devices as well as Chromecast, LG smart TVs, Samsung smart TVs, Vizio SmartCast TVs and more. Cord Cutter News was the first to report the new interface. Users that have seen the update were welcomed with a message from Hulu that writes, “Over the next few weeks, Hulu’s navigation menu will move to the left side of the screen on living room devices. Press ‘back’ to open the menu for easy access to TV, Movies, My Stuff, and more.” The update makes it easier for TV users to navigate to these destinations. Previously, viewers had to scroll all the way up to the top of the page. Users can now click on the remote’s back button to access the menu. Image Credits: TechCrunch Image Credits: TechCrunch The streaming company’s last major redesign push for the big screen was in 2020 when it introduced categories like “TV,” “Movies” and “Sports” through top navigation. Last October, the streaming service raised its prices from $6.99 per month to $7.99 per month for the ad-supported plan and from $12.99 per month to $14.99 per month for the ad-free plan. Disney’s ad-supported bundled plan with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu also went from $13.99 per month to $14.99 per month. In December, Hulu also hiked the Live TV bundle prices from $69.99 per month to $74.99 per month for the Basic plan, which offers Hulu Live TV and ESPN+ with ads and Disney+ with no ads. The premium plan got a raise from $75.99 per month to $82.99 per month, which offers Hulu + Live TV and Disney+ with no ads and ESPN+ with ads."

53,"AI-powered search engine Perplexity AI lands $26M, launches iOS app",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 4, 2023","A search startup raised $26 million recently to offer an AI-powered rival to Google. Perplexity AI, which bills itself as a “conversational search engine,” closed a Series A funding round led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from Databricks Ventures and angel investors including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun. The fresh tranche comes as Perplexity reports that it had 10 million monthly visits and 2 million unique visitors in February alone. That’s a far cry from the estimated 89 billion visits Google had in May 2022. But Perplexity is betting heavily on its AI tech to set it apart from the incumbents. Perplexity was founded in 2022 by Aravind Srinivas, Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho and Andy Konwinski, engineers with backgrounds in back-end systems, AI and machine learning. Yarats was a staff machine learning engineer at Quora for several years before joining Meta as an AI research scientist, while Srinivas interned at DeepMind and Google and later joined OpenAI as an AI researcher. Ho worked as an engineer at Quora, then a quantitative trader on Wall Street, and Konwinski was among the founding team at Databricks. Unlike a typical search engine, Perplexity offers a chatbot-like interface that allows users to ask questions in natural language, to which its AI responds by citing sites and sources from around the web. Users can ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into a particular topic and Perplexity will respond based on the context of its earlier responses. It’s not a new concept. The AI-powered ChatGPT and Bing Chat, similarly, let users get answers to questions on any number of topics by asking conversationally. But Perplexity’s founders claim that their tech performs better, overall, when it comes to accuracy. (Today’s chatbots are notorious for “hallucinating,” or just plain making up, answers to questions.) “We’ve built a first-of-its-kind conversational answer engine that’s grounded in providing accurate and relevant information through citations,” Srinivas said in a press release. “When people search online for answers to their questions, they’re presented with endless lists of links that can be manipulated by advertisers and search engine optimization. Individuals are then tasked with sifting through those websites and distilling the information, much of which may not be accurate in the first place. With Perplexity AI, we aspire to fix all of that.” Image Credits: Perplexity AI Image Credits: Perplexity AI That’s an ambitious mission. But Perplexity is forging ahead, releasing an iOS app in recent days that introduces features like user sign-in for personalization, persistent search history and social sharing. Srinivas says that the funds from the Series A will be put toward Perplexity’s growth and expansion plans, including “optimizing the application’s knowledge database.” “This is a first step in our mission of building the world’s most transparent information service and maximizing the knowledge and productivity of the average consumer,” he added. Perplexity is only the latest startup in the generative AI space to attract outsize investor attention. Just last month, Character.ai, a personalized chatbot platform, closed a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation. According to a PitchBook report released in March, VCs have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022."
54,Flipping is much easier than walking,['@bheater'],"April 27, 2023","I wrote about half of last week’s Actuator on Wednesday in an empty office at MassRobotics after meeting with an early-stage startup. I’m not ready to tell you about them just yet, but they’re doing interesting work and have one of the wilder founding stories of recent vintage, so stay tuned for that. Also, shoutout to Joyce Sidopoulos for being a very gracious host to a reporter stuck between meetings in Boston for a few hours. I would leave a five-star Airbnb rating if I could. From MassRobotics, I headed to Cambridge to have a nice long chat with Marc Raibert at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute. The newly founded institute is headquartered in the new 19-floor Akamai building, directly across the street from Google’s massive building and a stone’s throw away from the MIT lab where the seeds of the entire Boston Dynamics project were planted. Akamai is currently leasing at least four of the building’s floors, owing to some really unfortunate timing. The construction project was completed toward the end of 2019, which meant the space had a few good months before all hell broke loose. In May 2022, Akamai announced that it was offering permanent work from home flexibility to 95% of its 10,000 staff. Obviously not everyone who is allowed to work from home does, but in the wake of the pandemic, it’s safe to assume that many or most will. All the better for Raibert and the institute, I suppose. With a massive infusion of cash from Boston Dynamics parent, Hyundai, the organization is ready to take on some of robotics’ and AI’s toughest problems. But first, growth. Raibert tells me a sizable chunk of his day is spent interviewing candidates. There are currently something like 35 job listings with more on the way. And then there’s a listing under the title “Don’t see what you’re looking for?” with the description, “If you do not see a job posting for a role that matches your experience/interest, please apply here. We are still interested in hearing from you!” Nice work if you can get it, as they say. Currently the space looks like that of a standard startup, which could be a source of frustration for an organization looking to really lean into the laboratory setting. I get the sense that the next time I’m afforded the opportunity to visit, it will look very different — and be a lot more full. What it does have currently, however, is a whole bunch of Spot robots. There’s basically a doggy day care full of them off to one side. Raibert notes that the Spots were purchased and not given to the institute, as it and Boston Dynamics are separate entities, in spite of the name. Along another way are artists’ conceptions of how robots might integrate into our daily lives in the future. Some are performing domestic tasks, others are fixing cars, while others still are doing more fun acrobatic activities. Some of the systems bear an uncanny resemblance to Atlas and others are a bit more out there. Raibert says his team suggested the scenarios and the artist took them in whatever direction they saw fit, meaning nothing you see there should be taken as insight into what their robot projects might look like, going forward. The tasks they’re trying to solve, on the other hand, may well be represented in the drawings. Digging through some old MIT Leg Lab photos. Check out this shot of Boston Dynamics' Marc Raibert (right) on the set of the Connery/Snipes/Crichton flick, Rising Sun circa 1992. pic.twitter.com/DGtugbDaY1 — Brian Heater (@bheater) April 26, 2023  In front of these are several dusty robots from Raibert’s Leg Lab days that were “rescued” from their longtime homes in the MIT robot museum. That’s since taken me down a real rabbit hole, checking out the Leg Lab page, which hasn’t been updated since 1999 but features a pre-Hawaiian shirt Raibert smiling next to a robot and three dudes in hazmat suits on the set of 1993’s Rising Sun. Also, just scrolling through that list of students and faculty: Gill Pratt, Jerry Pratt, Joanna Bryson, Hugh Herr, Jonathan Hurst, among others. Boy howdy. Thursday was TechCrunch’s big Early Stage event at the Hynes Convention Center. For those who couldn’t make it, we’ve got some panel write-ups coming over the next week or so. I made sure the TechCrunch+ team published one of mine an hour or two ago, because I wanted to talk about it a bit here. The panel wasn’t explicitly about robotics, but we covered a lot of ground that’s relevant here. The role of the university post-research is a topic I’ve been thinking and writing a fair bit about over the past few years. It was a subject I was adamant we devote a panel to at the event, given that Boston’s apparently home to a school or two. My coverage has tended to approach the subject from the point of view of the schools themselves, asking simply whether they’re acting as a sufficient conduit. The answer is increasingly yes. Not to be too crass about it, but they’ve historically left a lot of money on the table there. That’s been a big piece of historical brain drain, as well. Look at how much better CMU and Pittsburgh have gotten at keeping startups local. Pae Wu, SOSV & CTO at IndieBio (SOSV) talk about “How to Turn Research Into a Business” at TechCrunch Early Stage in Boston on April 20, 2023. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch Pae Wu, SOSV & CTO at IndieBio (SOSV) talk about “How to Turn Research Into a Business” at TechCrunch Early Stage in Boston on April 20, 2023. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch You would be hard pressed to find someone with a more informed perspective on the other side of the equation than Pae Wu, general partner at SOSV and CTO at IndieBio. A bit of context is probably useful here. Last week’s event primarily featured talks from VCs targeted at an audience of early-stage investors. Wu spent part of her talk discussing how “recovered academics” can be successfully integrated into a founding team. But not every professor wants to embrace the “recovered bit.” I should say that I’ve experienced plenty of scenarios where professors appear to walk that line well. Just looking at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, you’ve got Ken Goldberg and Pieter Abbeel who are currently on the founding teams for Ambi Robotics and Covariant, respectively. “There are some sectors where it can work very well to have members of your founding team who remain in academia,” Wu says. “We see this all the time in traditional biotech and pharma. But in other types of situations, it can become, frankly, a drag on the company and problematic for the founders who are full-time. This is a very tough conversation that we have quite frequently with some of our committed academics: Your stake in this company isn’t really aligned with your time commitment.” Wu points to scenarios where the professor remains in a leadership role, while going on autopilot for the day-to-day. The issue, she explains, is when they frequently pop their heads in for suggestions divorced from the very time- and resource-intensive work of running a company. “Academics really love to say, ‘Well, I’m actually really good at multitasking, and therefore I can do this,’” she explains. “The majority of the time, the academic founder will come in and out and provide their sage wisdom to the full-time founders who have committed their lives and risked everything for this company. It starts to create challenges in getting the company to move forward. It creates interpersonal challenges as well for the founding team, because you have to be a special kind of saint to say, ‘I’m working 100 hours a week, I don’t make any money, and my whole financial future rests on the success of this company. And this guy keeps coming in to tell me some random thing that he read on the Harvard Business Review.’” Wu also offers a word of caution about university involvement at the early stage: If you want to be a VC-backed startup, beware the helpful university stuff. It might feel very, very comfortable. They do a great job of incubating companies, but I don’t know that they do a great job of accelerating companies. You get a lot of ‘free stuff,’ and [people often say] ‘Oh, this is a convenient EIR (education, innovation and research) program to work with, and this guy started 15 companies before.’ But this guy started 15 companies in sectors that have absolutely nothing to do with what you’re trying to do. You would absolutely be better off finding somebody who actually cares about your mission, isn’t paid by the university, but is incentivized to care deeply about your company. You can read (and agree or disagree with) the full article over on TechCrunch+. Image Credits: Tufts Image Credits: Tufts Friday, coincidentally, turned out to be university day for me. I didn’t manage to see much research on my last trip top Boston, so I made sure to carve out a day this time. The morning kicked off with a trip to Tufts. The last time I visited the school was in 2017. Human-Robot Interaction Lab director Matthias Scheutz told the video crew and myself about training robots to trust. Scheutz and I sat down again for a separate — but related — discussion. Before taking up the professor role, he received a joint PhD in cognitive science and computer science from Indiana University and another PhD in philosophy from the University of Vienna. It’s an unlikely combination that informs much of the work he does. With all of the ethical and moral detours during our conversation, I couldn’t stop thinking that it would have made a good podcast. At the heart of the interview is the team’s efforts to develop a shareable knowledge set between robots. In a subsequent demo in the nearby lab, one team member asked a Fetch research robot to assemble a screw caddy, but it doesn’t have the requisite knowledge. The human coworker then instructs the robot how to perform the process, step by step — “Execute while learning,” as they put it. Once it gains the knowledge, it runs through around 100 simulations in quick succession to determine the probability that it will perform the task correctly. Another team member asks a nearby Nao robot whether the Fetch knows how to perform the tasks. The two robots communicate nonverbally. Fetch runs through simulations again and shares the information with the Nao, who then communicates it to the human. The demo offers a quick shorthand for how networked robots can pass along the information they learned through a kind of network in the cloud — or a sky net, if you will. I’ve excerpted some of the more interesting bits from our conversation below. On Wednesdays, we use fetch to locate screws 🤖 #TryTech pic.twitter.com/Vbx3T2X6rV — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) April 27, 2023  [I’m told the above is a Mean Girls reference.] Distraction vs. overload If I can detect that you’re distracted, maybe what I need to do is get your attention back to the task. That’s a completely different interaction you want from one where you’re overloaded. I should probably leave you alone to finish the thing. So, imagine a robot that cannot distinguish between the distraction state, which should be very engaged and get the person back on task, compared with the person being overloaded. In that case, if the robot doesn’t know it, the interaction might be counterproductive for the team. If you can detect these states, it would be very helpful. Shared mental models One of the videos we have up on our web page shows you can teach this one robot that doesn’t know how to squat, how to squat, and the other one can immediately do it. The way to do it is to use the same shared mental model. We can’t do this. If you don’t know how to play piano, I cannot just put that in your head. That’s also part of the problem with all these deep neural nets that are very popular these days. You cannot share knowledge at that level. I cannot implant in your neural network (this goes for people, too) what I have been trained over many years of practicing piano. But if you push the abstraction a little bit higher, where you have a description that is independent of how it’s realized in the neural network, then you can share it. On multitasking The hot stove is a good example. The moment [the touch is issued by the brain], you may already realize it’s on, but it’s maybe too late. There’s a level of abstraction where I can intervene consciously and cognitively with the sequencing and I can alter things. There’s a level of discrete actions where sequencing occurs, also automatically. For example, years ago, when I was at Notre Dame, I drove to campus, but I didn’t want to go to campus. But I was thinking about work, and so this automatic system of mine drove me, and the next moment I was in a parking lot. I can talk to you and prepare food, no problem. But it needs to be rehearsed. If the activity is not rehearsed, you can’t do it. We have a layer in the [robotic] architecture that does that automatic sequencing. That’s the level at which we can share more complex actions. Your Roomba doesn’t know you exist There’s a fine line, where you need to have these mechanisms in place, because otherwise harm will follow if they’re not in place. You get this with autonomous cars; you get this in a lot of contexts. At the same time, we don’t want to prevent all robots, because we want to use them for what they’re good for — what they’re beneficial for. They need to have more awareness of what’s happening, what they’re being used for. It’s not a problem with a Roomba because it doesn’t even know you exist. They have no notion of anything. But if you look at YouTube, you will find videos of Roomba shoving pets under the couch. They have no awareness of any person or any thing in the environment. They don’t even know they’re doing a vacuuming task. It’s as simple as that. At the same time, you can see how much more massively sophisticated they would have to be in order to actually cognitively comprehend all the eventualities that could happen in an apartment. When robots say no Years ago, we had this video of a robot saying no to people. In some cases, people may not be aware of the state the robot is in, give it an instruction, and if the robot carried out that instruction, it would be bad for the robot or a person. So the robot needs to say no. But it can’t just say no and nothing else. It needs to tell you why not. If the robot just doesn’t do it, that’s not good. You won’t trust that robot to do something again. Editorial interjection here. The “no” video caused a bit of a stir for its perceived violation of Asimov’s second law, “A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.” Obviously there’s a clause baked into that second law that says the robot should not obey an order if doing so will injure a human (first law). But Scheutz doesn’t stop there. He paints a scenario in which a robot is carrying a box as it was told to do. Suddenly a different human tells the same robot to open a door, but doing so would cause it to drop — and damage — the box. In this case, the “no” isn’t about protecting a human, but it is about following orders. Immediately following the second order effectively negates its ability to carry out the first. It’s here, then, that the robot is required to say, “No, but don’t worry, I got you once I get this box where it needs to go.” Image Credits: MIT CSAIL Image Credits: MIT CSAIL After our chat, I head back to Cambridge for my first time back at MIT CSAIL since the pandemic started. Due to a last-minute change of plans, I wasn’t able to reconnect with Daniela Rus, unfortunately. I did, however, get a chance to finally speak to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) assistant professor Pulkit Agrawal. As it happened, I had recently written about his team’s work to teach a quadruped to play soccer on difficult surfaces like sand and mud. When I arrived, I commented on the Intel RealSense box in front of me. I’ve been looking for any reason to discuss the move away from LiDAR I’ve been seeing among roboticists of late, and this was a great in. Again, some highlights below. On why more roboticists are moving away from LiDAR Right now, we are not dealing with obstacles. If [the ball] does go away from the robot, it does need to deal with it. But even dealing with obstacles, you can do it with RGB. The way to think about this is that people wanted depth because they could write programs by hand of how to move the robot given a depth recording. But if we are going to move toward data-driven robotics, where I’m not writing my own program, but computers are writing it, it doesn’t matter whether I have depth or RGB. The only thing that matters is how much data I have. On grippers Why do people use suction cups? Because they’re like five bucks. It’s broken, you replace it. Even to get them to use a two-finger gripper, it’s $100. Even Amazon doesn’t want to put more sensors. Suppose you go to a company and say, “I want to add this sensor, because it might improve performance.” They’ll ask how much the sensor is going to cost and multiply it by the volume of how many robots they have. On “general purpose” robots Suppose you have one target, say, lifting boxes and putting them on the conveyer belt, and then there was pick and place and then loading them on the truck. You could have constructed three different robots that are more efficient at three different tasks. But you also have different costs associated with maintaining that different robot and integrating those different robots as part of your pipeline. But if I had the same robot that can do these different things, maybe it costs less to maintain them, but maybe they’re less performant. It comes down to those calculations. When I made reference to the Mini Cheetah robots the team has been working with, Agrawal commented, “It actually turns out flipping is much easier than walking.” “Speak for yourself,” I countered. He added, “What is intuitive for humans is actually counterintuitive for machines. For example, playing chess or playing go, machines can beat us. But they can’t open doors. That’s Moravec’s paradox.” Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch As promised, another question from our recent TechCrunch+ investor survey. Following the lead of robot vacuums, how long will it take before additional home robot categories go truly mainstream? Kelly Chen, DCVC: Medium-term, at best. Alphabet’s folding of Everyday Robots goes to show how even large resources cannot make home service robots viable today. The home is a highly unstructured environment. Going beyond the relatively simple exceptions that existing vacuum robots need to learn, the rest of the home is much more difficult. Additional tasks are in 3D, which may mean more sensors, actuators, manipulation, different grippers, force control, and much less predictability. We are not there yet in making this reliable and economical. Helen Greiner, Cybernetix Ventures: Five years for lawn mowers in the USA, based on vision-based navigation (combined with GPS) coming out. No setup wires and better UIs will drive demand. The network effect (neighbors copying neighbors) will drive demand after initial adoption. Thirteen years for a humanoid helper, based on Agility and X1 cost reduced and smarter. Paul Willard, Grep: It has already started. Labrador robots help mobility-challenged folks fetch and carry things around the house. So medication is always handy and taken on time, grocery delivery from the front door can be carried to the fridge and pantry to be put away, and dinner can be carried from the stove to the dining table while the customer has their hands full perhaps with a walker, a cane or a wheelchair. There will be more as the hardware that makes up the robots gets less expensive and more capable, simultaneously. Cyril Ebersweiler, SOSV: Most robotics companies eyeing B2C have moved to B2B over the years. The time, scale and amounts of money required to launch such a brand these days isn’t exactly what VCs are looking for. Image Credits: Robust.AI Image Credits: Robust.AI Had a chance to catch up with Rodney Brooks again (we have to stop meeting like this). This time he was joined by his Robust.AI co-founder and CEO, Anthony Jules. The startup’s work was shrouded in mystery for some time, leading to this fun headline from IEEE. We’ve got a much better handle on what the team does now: It makes a robotic cart and software management system for the warehouse. Brooks was understandably a bit hesitant to jump back into the hardware game. Jules told me: We started off trying to be a software-only company. We started looking at the space and decided there was a great opportunity to really create something that was transformative for people. Once we got excited about it, we did very standard product work to understand what the pain points are and what it was that would really help people in this space. We had a pretty clear vision of what would be valuable. There was one day I literally said to Rod, ‘I think I have a good idea for a company, but you’re going to hate it, because it means we might have to build hardware.’” Late last week, Robust announced a $20 million Series A-1, led by Prime Movers Lab and featuring Future Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, JAZZ Ventures and Playground Global. That follows a $15 million Series A announced back in late 2020. A Veo Robotics setup in a human-robot co-working environment.

Safar Partners and Yamaha Motor Ventures participated, but the most notable back is Amazon through its $1 billion Industry Innovation Fund. It’s easy to view these investments as a kind of trial run for potential acquisitions, though the company has largely denied that it uses the money as an on-boarding process. That said, it is certainly a vote of confidence and, at the very least, probably an indication that the company will begin piloting this technology in its own workspaces — assuming it hasn’t already. “The newest generation of intelligent robotic systems work with people, not separately from them,” says co-founder and CTO Clara Vu. “Unlocking this potential requires a new generation of safety systems — this is Veo’s mission, and we’re very excited to be taking this next step.” Veo develops a software safety layer for industrial robots, allowing them to operate alongside human co-workers outside of the cages seen on many floors.

55,Germany accuses Twitter of failing to remove illegal hate speech,['@riptari'],"April 4, 2023","In an early FAFO test for Elon Musk, Germany could be set to fine Twitter for repeatedly failing to comply with a social media hate speech takedowns law, aka the NetzDG, which requires swift removal of illegal content like hate speech. The Federal Justice Office (BfJ) announced the move in a press release today — saying it’s instigated a proceeding under the country’s Network Enforcement Act (aka, NetzDG) after establishing there are “sufficient indications of failures” in the platform’s complaint management processes. Under the NetzDG, social media platforms must response to user reports of illegal content, checking what’s been reported and removing content if it confirms it’s illegal, within seven days — or 24 hours for the most obviously illegal stuff. What’s illegal is governed by Germany’s criminal code, which includes hate speech, abuse and threats, and antisemitism. “Numerous pieces of content was reported to the BfJ that was published on Twitter, which the authority considers illegal and, despite user complaints, was not deleted or blocked by the provider within the legally stipulated periods. The fine proceedings initiated are based on this,” the BfJ said in a statement (which we’ve translated from German with machine translation). “In the case of individual violations by providers of social networks, of the inspection and deletion obligations in the NetzDG, it cannot generally be assumed that there is no effective procedure for dealing with complaints about illegal content. However, a systemic failure of complaint management is subject to fines, which occurs when violations of the relevant specifications of the NetzDG occur repeatedly in a timely manner and in a manner that is relevant to the subject.” The Office said the content it’s acting against Twitter over is “closely related in terms of time and substance” — indicting a “systemic failure in the provider’s complaint management”. “They were published on Twitter over a period of around four months and reported to the provider of Twitter as illegal by users,” it added. “All content contains similar, unjustified, defamatory statements of opinion, all directed against the same person. According to the BfJ, they constitute an offence.” On paper, Germany’s NetzDG law allows for fines up to €50 million for breaches of the regime. However, up to now, the government has not sought to enforce the law for content moderation violations — and, let’s face it, no social media firm can claim a perfect record on this front — so it’s interesting to see Musk’s Twitter needling the Justice Office into action at long last. (NetzDG came into force all the way back in October 2017, when Musk was more busy hyping Hyperloop and The Boring Company than beating Twitter to death.) The messaging platform Telegram was hit with NetzDG fines totalling €5.125 million last year. But that was for failing to provide users with tools to report illegal content and not setting up a legal entity in Germany to receive official comms from regulators — rather than for breaches of the takedown rules themselves, which is what Twitter appears to be facing here. We emailed Twitter’s press office for a response to the BfJ initiating a proceeding over system content moderation failures and it responded with an automated reply that contains the poop emoji — something Twitter’s press email account has been doing since late last month. (Musk previously liquidated Twitter’s comms department, paving the way for his remaining “hardcore” engineers to replace intelligent comms staff with a dumb algorithm.) Since Musk carried a sink into Twitter HQ at the end of October — to signal the start of his reign/flushing the platform down the drain — he’s set to slashing headcount and dismantling resources that had previously been directed into content moderation. Yet despite running a wrecking ball through the platform’s ability to respond to user reports of hateful content he has claimed to be reforming and improving its approach to moderation — making a big show of expanding an existing crowd-sourced fact-checking feature, called Community Notes. He’s suggested this is his preferred route to delivering decentralized and fair speech moderation, via a system to supplementary notes that may be appended to ‘bad speech’ rather than taking it down (combined with some penalties like removing the offending tweets from algorithmic recommendation). Thing is, Musk’s argument is not only disingenuous — outsourcing content moderation while gutting internal resource is not an improvement however you want to spin it — it’s also blind to the legal risk his decisions set the company up for in countries like Germany where there is no crowdsourced debate to be had over illegal content since the law requires prompt removal of illegal tweets. Hence the NetzDG offers an early test of Musk’s approach/claims/appetite for fines, as we reported last year. (NB: The European Union’s Digital Services Act also places legal requirements on how digital services need to approach content governance — and that regulation is coming into force across the EU for all digital services from early 2024; although a subset of larger platforms, so called VLOPs, are expected to be compliant sooner, likely from this fall, and it’s possible Twitter could hit the VLOP threshold. Fines under the incoming EU regime, meanwhile, can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover.) Back to Germany: Twitter appears to have a chance to steer out of what could be a multi-million-dollar NetzDG fine if it engages with the federal government over concerns about illegal content — as the BfJ says it’s giving the company the opportunity to comment on the alleged systemic failure of complaint management. If Twitter fails to do that, or — say — it sends a response that has as much substance as a poop emoji, the BfJ will move to the next stage of the proceeding by concluding that its allegation of illegal behavior remains justified — and apply to the Bonn District Court for the initiation of preliminary ruling proceedings. NetzDG requires a judge to rule on the illegality of the complained about content, prior to any fine being issued for a takedown failure, so it would be up to the District Court of Bonn to do that. If the court upholds the BfJ’s view of the content’s illegality the Office would then be empowered to hit Twitter with a fine. So there’s still time to stock up on popcorn for this one. If that wasn’t enough FAFOing in Germany, Musk’s Twitter is also facing a separate illegal content challenge over illegal content: Back in January, a holocaust denial hate speech lawsuit was filed by HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students who are seeking to establish whether companies with T&Cs that prohibit antisemitism have a contractual obligation to uphold their terms. The litigants are taking a different tack (vs NetzDG) — and, if their suit prevails, it could set a precedent that would apply more widely than just Twitter. So Musk’s tenure atop the bird could have wider significance for free speech than even he suspects.    "
56,3 takeaways from Substack’s newly released financial results,['@alex'],"April 7, 2023","I got excited — very excited — when I found out that Substack’s equity crowdfunding effort would result in it releasing financial results. Sadly, due to rules and the timing of the fundraise, Substack is not required to detail its financials for 2022, and so the startup released hard data for 2020 and 2021 along with certain user-specific metrics for last year. This provides an interesting, if incomplete, picture of the company’s health. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. I expected to spend some time this morning weighing in on the morality of Substack’s choice to not share its audited 2022 results, but Dan Primack nailed that argument this morning in Pro Rata. Since I can’t improve on his words, we can leave that point to Axios and instead focus our fire on parsing the data. So to kill time while we nurse our post-Y Combinator Demo Day hangovers, let’s dig into Substack’s growth model (inclusive of its most recent nonfinancial data), ponder over the company’s current financial health, and then compare its upcoming capital raise to its potential cash needs. This will be fun. Think of it like a quick look at a partial S-1 filing but for a Series B company. Sound good? To work! You can read all of Substack’s released financial results here in case you want to play along. To start, let’s note that the company raised lots of money through 2021 to invest in its platform and grow its user base. So while we consider its results through 2021, it’d be wise to remember that the company was growth-oriented at the time. How did that work out? Substack’s gross revenue scaled by over 400% to $11.9 million in 2021 from $2.4 million in 2020. That’s precisely the sort of top-line expansion that venture backers want to see from a startup in its investing cycle. The company had announced its massive $65 million Series B in early 2021, meaning that it had access to that cash in the year."
57,US investors slash Byju’s and Swiggy valuation,['@refsrc'],"March 31, 2023","Some of the biggest Indian startups are taking a haircut in their valuations, at least in the eyes of their investors, as some backers adjust their estimates amid the weakening global economy. BlackRock has cut the valuation of Byju’s, which is India’s most valuable startup at $22 billion, by nearly half to $11.5 billion, according to filings seen by TechCrunch. Indian news outlet The Arc first reported about the valuation cut. Swiggy, India’s most valuable food delivery startup at $10.7 billion, has been marked down to a valuation of about $8 billion by Invesco, according to disclosures by the U.S. fund seen by TechCrunch. Byju’s raised capital last year at a valuation of $22 billion and has topped up more financing in recent quarters on a convertible note with the previous valuation set as the cap, according to people familiar with the matter. BlackRock made the disclosure about its valuation adjustment on the Indian edtech giant in its 2022 annual report to shareholders. Swiggy climbed to $10.7 billion valuation in a round led by Invesco itself in January 2022. By the end of October, the Atlanta-headquartered firm had slashed the value of its Swiggy holdings and valued the firm at about $8 billion, filings showed. The valuation cuts add a new dimension to the impact of the dwindling market conditions on the Indian startups. Funding activity in the Indian startup ecosystem slowed down last year, but because many of the larger startups raised capital on convertible notes (and hence pushed the price discovery to a later date) or did not raise capital at all, their last valuations have largely remained unchanged. Masayoshi Son, founder and chief executive of SoftBank Group, alluded to this trend last year when he cautioned that the funding winter for startups may continue for longer because some unicorns were unwilling to accept lower valuations in fresh funding deliberations. It’s important to note nonetheless that investors value equity of their existing portfolio startups in different ways and one backer’s value adjustment, however noteworthy, does not necessarily represent the views of other investors — and sometimes those of the startups themselves."
58,New accounts now have to wait only 30 days for Twitter Blue,['@indianidle'],"March 24, 2023","Twitter has changed many things related to its subscription program, Twitter Blue, in the last few hours. The company has made the paid plan available for purchase globally, and also reduced the time new accounts must wait to be eligible for a Twitter Blue subscription to 30 days from 90 days. When Elon Musk first launched the Twitter Blue plan through which users could sign up for verification checkmarks, a ton of accounts started impersonating brands, politicians and celebrities. The company quickly rolled back the paid plan. To avoid this kind of mishap upon relaunch, Twitter added a condition that new accounts had to wait for 90 days before they could subscribe to Twitter Blue. “New subscriptions to Twitter Blue are available globally on web, iOS, or Android. Not all features are available on all platforms. Newly created Twitter accounts will not be able to subscribe to Twitter Blue for 30 days. We may also impose waiting periods for new accounts in the future at our discretion, and without notice,” the Twitter Blue page reads. Musk & co. are also killing off legacy verification checkmarks from April 1. Under previous management, these Blue marks highlighted notable people like politicians, activists, journalists, and other public figures. Notably, Twitter’s service to verify organizations currently costs $1,000 per month, with an additional $50 fee for every additional account associated with the organization. Musk noted that these affiliates will be verified automatically."
59,"In the new normal for VC, builders will win",['@whrobbins'],"April 9, 2023","Though this may be a tough pill for some investors, we are never going back to the days where venture capital firms can win by being the only term sheet on the table — the industry has raised too much capital for that to be possible, even for the most exceptional startups. As VCs continue to financialize themselves as the hedge fund and private equity industries did in decades past, VC firms must win with information advantage or by building the power and founder relationship to beat competitors head-on. Offering startups more money at higher prices was recently a popular way to secure allocations in desirable companies, but whether such decisions were backed by rigorous and compelling data was often questionable. Regardless, there are indeed legitimate, hard-earned info asymmetries that lead to unique deal access: exceptionally intimate founder relationships, superior sourcing processes, the capability to synthesize clear-eyed theses and so on. There are also ways to win in purely competitive scenarios where VCs have material information that their peers don’t, but I wouldn’t bet on the vast majority of firms getting much more than the marginal allocation left over by a16z, Sequoia and other large, sophisticated firms. In any case, it seems clear that the winners in venture over the next decade will be full-stack firms that continue to financialize the industry and boutique firms that successfully leverage specific networks or knowledge bases. Looking deep to the vision and initiative of each founder is the only way forward. So, how are firms evolving with this in mind? Sequoia innovated with their scout program years ago. In hindsight, it feels obvious that plugged-in operators tend to get the first look at founders spinning out to build a company. But at the time, this deal-flow strategy was rather unique. These days, as most firms have either copied or considered copying the scout program structure, deal flow becomes more commoditized. We’re approaching the limit on how much firms can offer scouts in terms of carry or check sizes. There’s limited loyalty, and deal flow often finds itself quickly propagating around anyway. The advantage is no longer in the concept of a scout program, but rather in new ways to find more deal flow than an internal team could ever source on their own. AngelList has done a wonderful job with Rollup Vehicles (everyone can be an angel), SPVs (everyone can be a GP) and funds/subscriptions (everyone can be an LP). The data gathered by owning this infrastructure is nearly unparalleled, and enabling this functionality makes a difference to those that use it. Firms that consistently write small LP checks in emerging managers have also done a great job of “buying” deal flow at large scale. For example, a16z systematically evaluates the investments made by angel, “micro,” and seed funds they back. What an excellent way to get a scoop on future rounds before any formal processes are run by founders! These examples represent two extremes: Tools like AngelList “arm the masses” of the tech world, while a16z’s strategy works well for those with billions to invest. I expect firms to be highly intentional and experimental in finding new ways to organize external sourcing networks with new incentive structures."
60,Spera raises $10M for its identity security posture management platform,['@fredericl'],"March 29, 2023","Spera, a Palo Alto-based security startup that provides businesses with the tools to proactively protect themselves from identity-driven threats, today said it has raised a $10 million seed funding round led by YL Ventures, with participation from a number of prominent angel investors and serial entrepreneurs. The company’s founders, Dor Fledel (CEO) and Ariel Kadyshevitch (CTO), argue that an organization’s identity surface is now the number one attack vector, yet as companies increasingly rely on an ever-growing number of third-party services, that’s also becoming increasingly hard to manage with legacy tools. That often means that employees get access rights to tools they don’t actually need to do their job and unnecessary high privileges in other tools — or that accounts of employees who have left the company may remain active on some third-party services. Image Credits: Spera Image Credits: Spera “Without visibility, these risks cannot be effectively measured, prioritized and remediated,” the company explains. “Attackers use this chaos to their advantage, despite the continued investment of security teams in IAM, Zero Trust programs and other identity security and risk management solutions.” With Spera, businesses get a single end-to-end tool that allows them to manage all aspects of identity security, be that visibility and context to prevent attacks, or remediation when things go awry. In the current market, where many businesses are looking to cut costs, a service like Spera also serves a purpose that goes beyond security: it helps companies lower their license costs, as it allows them to find dormant accounts that can be turned off. Image Credits: Spera Image Credits: Spera The company says that getting started on its platform is a relatively quick process thanks to its agent-less integration with existing identity providers and cloud- and on-prem applications. “Spera clearly zeroed in on one of today’s main CISO priorities and pain points, given the remarkable number of customers they’ve closed while still in stealth,” said John Brennan, senior partner at YL Ventures. “We’ve been bullish on the identity space for a while now, in light of the consistent feedback from our network that despite a massive allocation of budget to IAM solutions, existing IAM tools failed to deliver on their promise. Spera is changing the industry’s entire approach to identity, delivering a platform that is a single source of contextualized identity-related risk.”"
61,Disney cuts metaverse division as part of broader restructuring,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 27, 2023","Walt Disney Co. has eliminated its metaverse division as part of staff cuts that promise to reduce head count by around 7,000 across the company over the next two months, reports The Wall Street Journal. CEO Bob Iger said Monday that those layoffs would begin this week. Disney’s next-generation storytelling and consumer experiences unit, the small division that was developing metaverse strategies, looks like it’s one of the first to go. The metaverse division is headed by Mike White, who was promoted to the role from SVP of consumer experiences and platforms in February 2022 and charged with getting Disney deeper into the web3 space. The unit aimed to find ways to tell more interactive stories in immersive formats using Disney’s extensive library of intellectual property, according to WSJ. Aside from the Disney we all know and love, that extensive library includes Pixar, Marvel and all of the Star Wars movies and shows. All 50 or so members of the team have lost their jobs, sources told WSJ. White will remain at the company, but it’s not clear in what capacity. The company could not be reached for comment. Disney’s former CEO, Bob Chapek, brought White on last year with the goal of creating “an entirely new paradigm for how audiences experience and engage with our stories,” according to an internal memo. Chapek also described the metaverse as “the next great storytelling frontier” and a “perfect place to pursue our strategic pillars of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus.” The hiring of White and the creation of the new metaverse unit came a few months after Facebook rebranded to Meta in an attempt to identify with the futuristic technology into which CEO Mark Zuckerberg had been pouring billions of dollars. Iger took over for Chapek in November and, despite recent developments, seems to be bullish on the metaverse. He invested in and joined the board of Genies Inc. last year, a startup that lets users create online avatars for use in metaverse applications. The metaverse is still many years from going mainstream, which has frustrated many big tech companies that invested large sums on new entertainment formats. Despite Meta’s billions spent on the Oculus headset and building out the metaverse, there has been low user demand and general confusion among users about how to use the new technology for anything but gaming. Last month, Disney said it would make $5.5 billion in cuts and cut 7,000 jobs as part of a broader restructuring. Like many other large conglomerates, Disney is feeling the pressure to bring costs down, and that often means cutting out expensive moonshot projects that aren’t bringing in any near-term revenue. It’s not yet clear if Disney will continue to work on metaverse applications via other teams, since it’s a long-term bet. Zuckerberg has repeatedly asked investors to trust him, be patient and play the long game."
62,DBeaver takes $6M seed investment to build on growing popularity,['@ron_miller'],"April 11, 2023","When DBeaver creator Serge Rider began building an open source database admin tool in 2013, he probably had no idea that 10 years later, it would boast more than 8 million users. The open source product proved so popular that he launched a company to support it in 2017, and began building a commercial product for users with enterprise requirements. That commercial product has over 5,000 paying customers today, and the company decided that the time was right to take a $6 million seed investment to build on the product’s growing popularity. What is this product that so many people are using? CEO Tatiana Krupenya says that it’s an administrative tool that allows anyone to access data from a variety of sources. “DBeaver provides a GUI interface that connects to all data sources and stores, enables special extensions for big data databases, and includes supplemental features like a data viewer, an editor, mock data generator, metadata browsing and visual query builders, enabling users to dynamically access all of their databases while working within one environment,” according to the company. Krupenya says this capability puts data administration in reach of not just the most technical data engineers, but also people in other lines of business roles, who normally might not have access to tools like this. “So DBeaver is the universal database management tool, and we do everything that people need to do with data…Most of our users are very deep technical people like database administrators or developers, but at the same time, we have data analysts, different kinds of managers, financial analysts and machine learning specialists. So actually anyone who needs to work with data can use DBeaver,” she told TechCrunch. For the first few years, Rider just put up a website and people discovered the open source tool, but when he put it on GitHub in 2016, it really took off and quickly grew to a community of more than 300,000 users. By the time Krupenya and Rider started the company in 2017, it was becoming difficult to manage the needs of a community that large and have a full-time job, and it was at that point they launched the company officially. When they released the commercial version, they sold their first license the following day because people in the community wanted to support them financially. The main difference between the commercial and open source is how the product tends to get used. For an individual developer connecting to a database, the open source product is probably enough, but if you’re working for a larger organization with infrastructure in the cloud and with security requirements, the commercial version is probably better suited to your needs. Paying customers include IBM, Samsung and Moody’s (and some other big names she couldn’t share publicly). Today, the company has 40 employees, and it intends to remain lean. Part of the advantage of having an engaged community of developers involved with the open source product is that they can help add features to the product like translating it into different languages. She says building a diverse company is one of the core values and they have a diverse team across all aspects of the organization. Today’s $6 million seed was led by Headline with participation from PTV."
63,AI-powered supply chain startup Pando lands $30M investment,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"May 3, 2023","Signaling that investments in the supply chain sector remain robust, Pando, a startup developing fulfillment management technologies, today announced that it raised $30 million in a Series B round, bringing its total raised to $45 million. Iron Pillar and Uncorrelated Ventures led the round, with participation from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners, Chiratae Ventures and Next47. CEO and founder Nitin Jayakrishnan says that the new capital will be put toward expanding Pando’s global sales, marketing and delivery capabilities. “We will not expand into new industries or adjacent product areas,” he told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Great talent is the foundation of the business — we will continue to augment our teams at all levels of the organization. Pando is also open to exploring strategic partnerships and acquisitions with this round of funding.” Pando was co-launched by Jayakrishnan and Abhijeet Manohar, who previously worked together at iDelivery, an India-based freight tech marketplace — and their first startup. The two saw firsthand manufacturers, distributors and retailers were struggling with legacy tech and point solutions to understand, optimize and manage their global logistics operations — or at least, that’s the story Jayakrishnan tells. “Supply chain leaders were trying to build their own tech and throwing people at the problem,” he said. “This caught our attention — we spent months talking to and building for enterprise users at warehouses, factories, freight yards and ports and eventually, in 2018, decided to start Pando to solve for global logistics through a software-as-a-service platform offering.” There’s truth to what Jayakrishnan’s expressing about pent-up demand. According to a recent McKinsey survey, supply chain companies had — and have — a strong desire for tools that deliver greater supply chain visibility. Sixty-seven percent of respondents to the survey say that they’ve implemented dashboards for this purpose, while over half say that they’re investing in supply chain visibility services more broadly. Pando aims to meet the need by consolidating supply chain data that resides in multiple silos within and outside of the enterprise, including data on customers, suppliers, logistics service providers, facilities and product SKUs. The platform provides various tools and apps for accomplishing different tasks across freight procurement, trade and transport management, freight audit and payment and document management, as well as dispatch planning and analytics. Customers can customize the tools and apps or build their own using Pando’s APIs. This, along with the platform’s emphasis on no-code capabilities, differentiates Pando from incumbents like SAP, Oracle, Blue Yonder and E2Open, Jayakrishnan asserts. “Pando comes pre-integrated with leading enterprise resource planning (ERPs) systems and has ready APIs and a professional services team to integrate with any new ERPs and enterprise systems,” he added. “Pando’s no-code capabilities enable business users to customize the apps while maintaining platform integrity — reducing the need for IT resources for each customization.” Pando makes a best effort to automate processes around the supply chain. Image Credits: Pando Pando makes a best effort to automate processes around the supply chain. Image Credits: Pando Pando also taps algorithms and forms of machine learning to make predictions around supply chain events. For example, the platform attempts to match customer orders with suppliers, customers through the “right” channel (in terms of aspects like cost and carbon footprint) and fulfillment strategy (e.g. mode of freight, carrier, etc.). Beyond this, Pando can detect anomalies among deliveries, orders and freight invoices and anticipate supply chain risk given demand and supply trends. Pando isn’t the only vendor doing this. Altana, which bagged $100 million in venture capital last October, uses an AI system to connect to and learn from logistics and business-to-business data — creating a shared view of supply chain networks. Everstream, another Pando rival, offers its own dashboards for data analysis, integrated with existing ERP, transportation management and supplier relationship management systems. But Pando has a compelling sales pitch, judging by its momentum. The company counts Fortune 500 manufacturers and retailers — including P&G, J&J, Valvoline, Castrol, Cummins, Siemens, Danaher and Accuride — among its customer base. Since the startup’s Series A in 2020, revenue has grown 8x while the number of customers has increased 5x, Jayakrishnan said. Asked whether he expects expansion to continue well into the future, given the signs of potential trouble on the horizon, Jayakrishnan seemed fairly optimistic. He pointed to a Deloitte survey that found that more than 70% of manufacturing companies have been impacted by supply chain disruptions in the past year, with 90% of those companies experiencing increased costs and declining productivity. The result of those major disruptions? The digital logistics market is estimated to climb to $46.5 billion by 2025, per Markets and Markets — up from $17.4 billion in 2019. Crunchbase reports that investors poured more than $7 billion in seed through growth-stage rounds globally for supply chain-focused startups from January to October 2022, nearly eclipsing 2021’s record-setting levels. “Pando has a strong balance sheet and profit and loss statement, with an eye on profitable growth,” Jayakrishnan said. “We’re are scaling operations in North America, Europe and India with marquee customer wins and a network of strong partners … Pando is well-positioned to ride this growth wave, and drive supply chain agility for the 2030 economy.”"
64,"Hyundai, GM partner with Korean battery makers to build US plants",['@rebeccabellan'],"April 25, 2023","Hyundai Motor Group and General Motors announced separately Tuesday plans to build electric vehicle battery plants in the U.S. in partnership with South Korean battery manufacturing firms. Hyundai will set up a $5 billion battery cell production joint venture in the U.S. with SK On, the company that is also working with Ford to set up battery plants. GM will partner with Samsung SDI to jointly invest $3 billion in an EV battery plant. The partnerships come as EV battery competition heats up in the U.S., with automakers foreign and domestic racing to build battery supply chains nationally in order to be eligible for the Biden administration’s EV tax credit. New battery sourcing rules went into effect in April that restrict the full $7,500 tax credit to vehicles with battery materials procured and processed in the U.S. or by trade agreement partners. The announcements also come as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol travels to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden. South Korean automakers have pushed back against the administration’s new rules prohibiting vehicles built outside the U.S. from receiving the credit. Hyundai’s partnership with SK On follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding in November 2022. Both companies will hold a 50% stake in the $5 billion investment, according to Hyundai. The Hyundai-SK JV will establish a battery cell plant in Bartow County, Georgia, which is close to Hyundai’s U.S. production facilities in Alabama and Georgia. Hyundai says the plant will start manufacturing battery cells in the second half of 2025 with annual production capacity of 35 GWh, which should support the production of 300,000 EVs.     Hyundai Mobis, the automaker’s parts and services arm, will assemble battery packs with cells from the plant and supply them to the automaker for use in upcoming Hyundai, Kia and Genesis EV models. SK On has previously worked with Hyundai to build batteries for models such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and Genesis GV60. The GM-Samsung factory is expected to start production in 2026, and will have more than 30 GWh of capacity. This should bring GM’s total U.S. battery cell capacity to about 160 GWh. The automaker is building out four other battery factories in the U.S. It’s not yet clear where this new plant will be built. GM said the production lines at its new plant will build “nickel-rich prismatic and cylindrical cells.” Prismatic and cylindrical cells are two of the three types of EV battery cells. GM’s Ultium battery platform currently uses the third style — pouch — for most of its vehicles.  "
65,YouTube TV says it’s experimenting with picture quality enhancements,['@laurenforristal'],"April 24, 2023","YouTube TV users have long complained of poor picture quality, low bitrate and other issues that impact the streaming experience. The company finally addressed the issues, including an increased bitrate for some live content, a fix for the 5.1 surround sound syncing issue and a major upgrade for the YouTube TV app for Apple TV. After subscribers experienced a steep price hike of $72.99/month, it’s crucial that YouTube TV ensures a smooth viewing performance for its users to enjoy. In a Reddit post on the YouTube TV subreddit last week, the company revealed that it’s testing transcoding changes, which will increase the bitrate for live 1080p content. A higher bitrate means better video quality. From a livestreaming perspective, however, this also means the video requires more bandwidth — which may lead to buffering issues. It’s crucial that viewers have a strong internet connection in order to have a quality streaming experience. This is likely why the picture quality improvement will only target devices that support the VP9 codec with high-speed internet connections, according to the post. The test will roll out over the next few weeks. If everything goes to plan, YouTube TV will make the change permanent by the summer. The company didn’t mention any plans to upgrade 720p content. The Reddit post also mentions that YouTube TV found the cause of a 5.1 audio/video sync issue and is currently working on a solution. In June 2022, a few Reddit and Twitter users reported audio sync issues after YouTube TV’s 5.1 audio update. While the company didn’t specify what exactly caused the sync issue, the fix will likely be a great relief to some subscribers. YouTube TV then outlined several recent bug fixes to the YouTube TV app for Apple TV. This includes 4K playback issues, YouTube TV’s HDR implementation and users seeing a black screen when opening up the app or switching between content. The company also said that it’s trying to find a solution for app crashes on the Apple TV 4K (1st generation). After announcing its multiview feature last month, YouTube TV said in the recent Reddit post that it’s continuing to experiment with upgrades ahead of the NFL season. Plus, users can now sign up for NFL Sunday Ticket subscriptions at a discounted presale price until June 6.    "

68,The 2025 all-electric Ram 1500 Rev has an absolutely massive battery,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 5, 2023","The electric trucks war has prompted automakers to throw all kinds of technological and EV-inspired bells and whistles into their pickups in hopes of pulling in new buyers and capturing a greater slice of the market. This one-upmanship has also led to increasingly bigger battery packs in a bid to offer industry-topping range. It’s a phenomenon that seemed to peak with the GMC Hummer EV and its 212.7 kilowatt-hour capacity battery pack, which at 2,983 pounds weighed the same as some small cars. Then Ram showed up to the party. The Stellantis brand revealed Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show more details and specs on the 2025 Ram 1500 REV — its first all-electric pickup truck set to go on sale in 2024 — including an optional 229 kWh battery pack with a targeted range of up to 500 miles. The EV is part of parent company Stellantis’ bid to sell 75 BEVs globally, with a specific U.S. product offensive of more than 25 all-new BEVs by the end of the decade. Buyers will have a lot of choices once the the 2025 Ram 1500 REV comes to market, including five trim levels with a new one called Tungsten sitting at the very top of the lineup. But one choice that promises to deliver a jump in weight and cost will be the battery. Buyers will have two battery options: a 168 kWh battery pack with a targeted range of up to 350 miles and the optional upgrade to the 229 kWh pack with 500 miles range. (Note the figures are not EPA estimates yet.) If those targeted ranges prove out, they would surpass rival EV trucks, the Ford F-150 Lightning and the GMC Hummer EV. Both are industry-topping sizes. And Ram says that both battery options can add up to 110 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes with 800-volt DC fast charging at up to 350 kW. And if one can believe it, Ram teased an XR edition to the new all-electric truck that will have “class-shattering range.” Could an even bigger battery pack be on its way? The Ford F-150 Lightning has a 98 kWh battery pack or an optional 131 kWh extended range version and the Rivian has a 105 kWh battery pack in its dual motor truck as well as a 135 kWh pack for its quad motor version. Rivian is popping that up even more with its highly anticipated max pack, which will have 181 kWh of capacity when it eventually comes to market. Notably, Ram has not shared the weight, the EPA estimated range or the kilowatt-hours used per 100 miles for the vehicle. Those last two items are particularly important because battery size doesn’t translate directly to more range. The efficiency of the battery combined with the aerodynamics of the vehicle can deliver more (or less) range. 2025 Ram 1500 REV Tungsten interior. Image Credits: Ram 2025 Ram 1500 REV Tungsten interior. Image Credits: Ram The Ram 1500 REV made its debut last month in a Super Bowl ad and did share a few specs and, of course, lots of beauty shots. Now, the brand is releasing a lot more details, except for the pricing and those EPA estimated range numbers. The Ram 1500 REV will be built on the new STLA Frame body-on-frame architecture designed specifically for full-size electric vehicles. Ram says the new EV truck’s powertrain will be able to produce 654 horsepower and 620 pound-feet of torque that allows the vehicle to travel from 0 to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. Yeah, that’s a helluva of a lot of get up and go to push a heavy truck with a massive battery in it. Ram is also targeting a 14,000 pounds towing and a maximum payload capacity of 2,700 pounds. Ram, of course, is all about off-roading, and the REV won’t be any different. The Ram 1500 REV is equipped with dual 250-kilowatt electric drive modules (EDMs) that combine the motor, gearbox and inverter along with all-wheel drive capability. There is one EDM on the front axle with an automatic wheel-end disconnect. That’s important because it allows the front wheels to spin freely in certain conditions, maximizing efficiency. Another 250-kilowatt EDM is positioned on the rear axle available with an electronic-locking rear differential. The vehicle also comes with several other features that aim to leverage its battery power. The Ram 1500 REV will offer vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid bi-directional charging, according to the company. Like other automakers in the truck war, these features are marketed to buyers keen on powering tools and sending power to their home during a blackout, or, as Ram puts it, “run the tailgate party or provide power at the camp or jobsite.” An on-board power panel in the bed can also provide up to 7.2 kW while an available on-board power panel in the frunk provides up to 3.6 kW. 2025 Ram 1500 REV Tungsten interior. Image Credits: Ram 2025 Ram 1500 REV Tungsten interior. Image Credits: Ram Moving inside, the Ram 1500 REV (and particularly the new Tungsten trim) is certainly pushing the bounds of truck luxury. The Tungsten trim even comes with its own interior colors described as indigo sea salt. The trim has platinum patina textured metal accents with diamond knurling and suede wrapped headliner, A- and B-pillars and visors. The quilted leather front driver and passenger seats can be heated and ventilated and also moved in 24 different ways. And yes, there is a massage function, power lumbar support and four-way powered headrests. The vehicle comes with a Klipsch Reference Premiere audio system with 23 speakers, all-new dual wireless chargers and a metal pedal kit. And over in infotainment land, Ram steps it up with loads of screens. The Uconnect 5 infotainment starts with a14.5-inch touchscreen at the center. The driver also has a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a heads-up display that projects speed and navigation on the windshield. Notably, the Ram 1500 REV will have a 10.25-inch passenger screen that will let the user access navigation, entertainment (via HDMI) and the ability to view the exterior vehicle cameras."
69,How brands can stay ahead of the e-commerce curve,[],,"The e-commerce industry has undergone rapid and transformative changes in recent years, with new technologies, consumer trends, and business models emerging at an unprecedented pace. Retailers, who experienced a surge in demand from customers due to the pandemic, dedicated the last three years to strengthening their capacities in fields such as human resources, finance, and technology. However, the changing economic environment means e-commerce providers now have to reevaluate their strategies for attracting and retaining customers. E-commerce traffic in North America declined 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, according to the New York Times. Conversion rates dropped 12 percent during the same period. This has led to retailers prioritizing one thing: efficiency.  Automating the business processes and workflows has become a key way for brands to cut costs amid the challenging e-commerce environment. But to move the needle in online shopping, brands must be aware of the trends influencing consumers’ expectations and leverage them. They’ll need the right analytical insights to navigate through the highly competitive e-commerce landscape and identify the most valuable opportunities for their growth. By collaborating with an established e-commerce platform like Shoplazza, brands can discover a quicker and more effective way to achieve their e-commerce goals and meet customer expectations.   Launching a digital store requires more than business skills and venturing into e-commerce can be a steep and costly learning curve for entrepreneurs. Since the customer journey is affected by every facet of the business, it’s essential for e-commerce brands to concentrate on multiple factors when evaluating their customers’ journey. Customers today are looking for brands and products that cater to their unique needs, which is why investing in personalization can yield a revenue growth of up to 30 percent. To provide something a customer might be interested in, companies need to use more sophisticated recommendation algorithms to offer complementary products or services instead of just the things the shopper has already browsed or bought. But implementing personalization strategies can be expensive and time-consuming. Shoplazza has built out a robust infrastructure for fast data retrieval to provide merchants with insights into their customers’ needs and preferences without exhausting their financial resources. Having reliable analytics data about customers’ preferences and where they’re likely to face obstacles can help brands prevent user frustration and smooth over any confusion in the customer’s journey. Besides personalization, navigating the waters of shipping speed can be challenging for even the most experienced brands. Around three in four shoppers say that product shipping is key to their overall shopping experience and they are much less likely to make a repurchase from a brand if they encounter delivery issues. Shoplazza has dedicated an entire team to tackle the issue and to link vendors with shipping companies such as FedEx or UPS to negotiate on their behalf and secure the most favorable express shipping rates. Shoplazza looks at each merchant as a unique case study to provide a set of customized services and analytical insights, with a real person available to answer questions and offer immediate assistance. “Our experience in dealing with merchants across the globe has allowed us to gain a deep understanding of their pain points throughout the business cycle,” says Luk Chan, Shoplazza’s Associate Director of Global Key Accounts. “Our goal is to provide customized, human-centric services to our clients and strive for long-term sustainability for their business.”   Machine learning has become critical for e-commerce firms to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of data they accumulate. This helps brands identify customer behavioral patterns and fine-tune their marketing campaigns to suggest similar products that cater to the needs of individual shoppers. Shoplazza has leapt to the forefront of this trend by leveraging its ML-powered algorithm to optimize pricing for brands that can’t always track competitors’ rates. By generating a graphical representation of price fluctuations, brands can visualize market dynamics and make informed business decisions. This enables companies to stay competitive by dynamically adjusting their pricing based on the market demand and competition.  “We operate in a fast-changing business environment where trends can shift rapidly, sometimes on a quarterly basis. This is a big challenge for some of our clients,” Luk Chan says. “The continuous stream of information bombs we receive on our desktops and phones can make it challenging for brands to discern which trends are applicable to their business.” Shoplazza is currently developing over 56 free building applications that clients can download and install to meet specific needs and provide merchants with tangible tools that can streamline their operations.   In the U.S. alone, social commerce retail earnings are predicted to reach nearly $80 billion by 2025. The line between e-commerce and social media is fading, and as more social media platforms incorporate e-commerce features. As a result, merchants will need to develop strategies to seamlessly analyze data from various channels to streamline customer analysis. Shoplazza is addressing this trend by connecting merchants with popular platforms like TikTok and Pinterest, and enabling them to track customer data across platforms. Another big trend making its way into e-commerce is augmented reality. The world of AR shopping may seem like futuristic sci-fi, but in reality, businesses are already using AR to sell products. Augmented reality allows customers to virtually try on and test products through an electronic device such as a smartphone or virtual reality headset. While still in its early stages, Shoplazza is researching how they can incorporate AR into their platform and allow for an immersive shopper experience.  Shoplazza is also researching the potential of voice commerce, which allows customers to make purchases using voice commands. This could be through a voice assistant such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, or a chatbot. Ultimately, the evolution of e-commerce calls for a blend of strategies, each one unlocking a different advantage for brands as they seek their competitive edge. By partnering with an industry leader like Shoplazza, brands can stay nimble, flexible, and responsive to market changes. “Being adaptive and open minded are crucial to today’s commerce landscape,” says Shoplazza COO Alyson Zhang. “Our effort in automation aligns seamlessly with the current AI momentum that continuously increases efficiency, reduces costs, and improves the customer experience — ultimately leading to increased sales and revenue.”   CTA: Download Shoplazza’s Social Commerce Playbook 2023 for more valuable insights on key e-commerce trends."
70,Rwazi to scale its market intelligence platform backed by $4 million seed funding,['@annienjanja'],"March 23, 2023","In emerging markets like Africa, offline channels dominate retail sales, which are often driven by informal trade and cash transactions. This makes sourcing data on markets, consumer behavior and products a herculean task. Yet, local and international brands require data about market size and value, consumer profiles and their purchasing power, and penetration of their competitors’ products to establish their presence or expand into such markets. To save brands from entering emerging markets blindly, Rwazi, a market intelligence startup, is out to bridge this gap by providing market insights backed by data collected directly from consumers. Rwazi’s co-founder and CEO Joseph Rutakangwa told TechCrunch that unlike larger research firms, which make inferences based on sample information, the startup seeks unit-level data like the products bought, frequency of purchases and geographic location of the consumers. Launched in 2021, the startup is now scaling in emerging markets, including in Africa, where it claims to already have a presence in 40 countries. Rutakangwa also says they are available in other markets like South Asia and Latin America. Its expansion plans and planned product launches are backed by a $4 million seed funding round that was led by Bonfire Ventures and saw participation from Newfund Capital and Alumni Ventures. “We are rolling out new products this year that support different languages, because this has been a barrier to our growth in these regions,” said Rutakangwa, who co-founded the startup with Eric Sewankambo. The startup says supporting multiple languages will help them scale in their existing markets and broaden the demographics of the consumers they get data from. Rwazi gets users to log their purchases through a web or mobile app, and after their submissions are verified, compensates them for the effort. The startup decided to source data directly from consumers after several ineffective iterations that had it using agents and sales teams. “By using Rwazi, multinationals access data on who is buying what, for how much, from where, when and why, to help them drive revenue and expand. Because brands are getting data from the horse’s mouth and can see how consumers are making purchasing decisions, they can do hyper-local messaging, pricing and packaging,” said Rutakangwa. Rwazi collects data such as product usage, frequency of consumption, and household budgets and income. What data the startup collects is based on the needs of its customers who use its SaaS product. Rutakangwa says they launched Rwazi because they had to try to obtain timely market insights in their previous jobs, which helped them understand how frustrating the process could get and how valuable that information could be. He says most available data, often collected by state agencies, is either outdated or focuses on general trends, and lacks the granularity that is needed to make accurate decisions. Rwazi, which was part of the Techstars Los Angeles accelerator program last year, currently has a network of 50,000 consumers. Its customers include 18 multinational corporations that track more than 200 different products across sectors including fast-moving consumer goods, healthcare, telecommunications, and financial services. Some brands are using its platform to determine locations for expansion or where to invest to boost their competitiveness. “Others are looking for new markets that are growing and have good demographics — regions where they can start establishing themselves to be able to capture future sales,” he said.

71,A 12% decline in global smartphone shipments is what passes for stability these days,['@bheater'],"April 18, 2023","At a certain point, the market will, indeed, stabilize. It has to. Demand for new smartphones has been consistently down for some time now, but the phones themselves are, obviously, here to stay. This is how we arrive at surveys that suggest people would give up shampooing or lose a finger rather than go without a handset (shakes fist “millennials!!). But macro climates are gonna macro climate. And these new figures from Canalys feel awfully like numbers from the last several quarters. Q1 2022 saw a 12% year-over-year drop in global smartphone shipments. It’s the fifth straight quarter of decline for the category. So why does something like that warrant a Canalys headline like, “Global smartphone market shows signs of stability with a 12% decline in Q1 2023”? “Stability” is, of course, a relative thing. Perhaps there’s a sense in which continued decline is stable — or at very least predictable. But that’s not what the firm is talking about here. Instead, it’s signals in the noise that point to some reason to be hopeful. “However, we have noticed some signs of moderation in the continued decline,” says analyst Toby Zhu. “There have been improvements in demand for certain smartphone products and price bands. Furthermore, some smartphone vendors are becoming more active in production planning and ordering components. Canalys predicts that the inventory of the smartphone industry, irrespective of channel or vendor, can reach a relatively healthy level by the end of the second quarter of 2023.” Image Credits: Canalys Image Credits: Canalys Stability here means that, assuming a lot more things don’t suddenly go sideways for the world (not a bet I’d necessarily be willing to make at this point), things could start turning around for the market as soon as the end of this quarter. Embracing my tendency to embrace cheery optimism, I’ll point out that things have had a tendency to pile up lately. Declines pre-dated the pandemic and were ultimately accelerated by it. Then there were supply chain issues and then macroeconomic struggles. Knock-on effects upon knock-on effects. From where I sit, here’s the primary reason to be positive: phones are commodities now. Sooner or later, people are going to need to upgrade. Phone manufacturers haven’t done a great job priming that pump — and the industry has yet to agree on a 6G standard — but at a certain point, devices slow down, batteries stop holding their charge and the time comes to buy a new one. We’re three years into this global pandemic, and that time is probably right over the horizon for a lot of folks who have been holding off for various reasons. I suspect Apple having its hand forced on USB-C adoption will ultimately have a positive impact on iPhone 14 sales, as well. This time out, however, Apple hit second, at 21% of the market to Samsung’s 22. Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five."
72,Saudi’s Savvy Games Group to acquire mobile games company Scopely for $4.9 billion,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 5, 2023","Savvy Games Group, a games and esports company that is part of the Saudi government’s Public Investment Fund, has agreed to acquire mobile games studio Scopely for $4.9 billion. Founded in 2011, Scopely is known for several popular mobile games including Yahtzee With Buddies, Star Trek Fleet Command, Marvel Strike Force, Stumble Guys and Scrabble Go. The Los-Angeles based company had a $3.3 billion post-money valuation in 2020 after raising a $340 million funding round. Scopely has grown over the past few years with a number of notable acquisitions. In 2020, Scopely acquired Disney’s FoxNext Games, and in 2021, the company acquired Sony Pictures Entertainment’s GSN Games for $1 billion. “Scopely is one of the fastest-growing games companies today, and we have long admired their ability to build loyal, engaged player communities,” said Savvy Games Group CEO Brian Ward in a press release. “At Savvy Games Group, our mission is to invest in – and grow – the global games community by inviting the best minds to join us.” Scopely will operate as an “autonomous company” under the Savvy umbrella, which includes esports firms ESL and Faceit. The company will continued to be led by co-CEOs Walter Driver and Javier Ferreira. “As part of the Savvy Games Group portfolio, we will continue to build one of the world’s most diversified mobile-first games companies,” said Scopely co-CEO Javier Ferreira in a press release. Our technology platform, market-leading studio ecosystem, and world-class team have always enabled us to stay one step ahead of the rapidly growing games industry, delivering long-lasting franchises that delight players around the world. We look forward to reimagining the future of play with Brian and the Savvy team.” Savvy says the acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, will strengthen its ability to deliver new products for the global gaming community. The company also says the acquisition will build on Scopely’s cross-platform approach to extend its live services expertise to new segments like PC, console and more. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the Saudi Arabian government is betting $38 billion to become the next hub for the video-game industry, and that Savvy is looking to develop and acquire top-tier games. The deal marks the sixth biggest acquisition in video games history in terms of price. The top place in this category goes to Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in a deal that’s still in the process of being completed, followed by Take-Two acquiring Zynga for $12.7 billion, Tencent buying Supercell for $8.6 billion, Microsoft purchasing ZeniMax for $8.1 billion and Activision buying King for $5.9 billion.

73,Hackajob matches technical talent with companies looking to hire,['@ron_miller'],"May 3, 2023","Even today with all of the layoffs we have seen in the tech industry over the last year, there is still a shortage of technical talent. That’s partly because there is a limited number of workers with these skills, and partly because it’s not just technology companies that are looking for technical talent. Enter Hackajob, a two-sided marketplace that brings together technical candidates and companies looking for help. One twist with this approach is that Hackajob makes the companies apply for the talent, rather than the other way around. It’s an approach that seems to be resonating, and today the company announced a $25 million Series B investment. Company co-founder and CEO Mark Chaffey says that the reason we are not seeing a dip in technical talent demand is that tech workers are needed everywhere. “Technology has evolved from a stand-alone industry to a function that touches every single industry. And I think what we see is that the demand for technical individuals far outstrips the supply,” Chaffey told TechCrunch. “We describe ourselves as a full stack talent platform that is primarily focused on helping enterprise organizations find, engage, hire and retain technical individuals,” he said. This involves a few products. The first is the two-sided marketplace where companies and job seekers post their requirements, and because the companies pitch the job seekers, rather than the other way around, this creates a situation where the candidate feels wanted and is more likely to respond. “This creates a really magical candidate experience because you only get that positive reaffirmation from companies that want to speak to you,” he said. That in turn generates an 85% response rate to employers. “So employers have got this really engaged talent pool that they can access.” The other products include a testing and remote interviewing platform and a diversity and inclusion module to make sure companies are interviewing a diverse pool of candidates. They collect a bunch of data to help companies find a good match, including salary expectations, visa status, location preferences, tech stack, and so on. In addition, they validate the skills, so the employer knows they are getting someone with the skill set they require for the job. With all that data, they can feed it into machine learning models, which can help interpret the information on the candidate’s résumé into structured data “to make the relevancy work better on both sides.” The company was founded in 2014, and Chaffey reports they are just north of $10 million ARR with a net revenue rate of around 150%, so they are getting customers and keeping them. They have over 500,000 users on the candidate site with 200 paying customers, which he describes as global enterprise organizations, across multiple industries. Hackajob currently has 120 employees. They hired 19 people recently, 16 of which were hired through the company’s own marketplace, and Chaffey says he thinks a lot about building a diverse workforce. “I’ve spent a lot of time speaking about diversity and inclusion and working with customers on the importance of it, and the point is that more diverse teams are typically, from all the data, higher performing because you’ve just got different opinions coming together. So it’s something that’s central to us,” he said. Today’s $25 million round was led by Volition Capital with participation from Axa Venture Partners, Foresight and Future Fund. The company has now raised a total of $33 million, per Crunchbase data.  "
74,Snapchat adds new safeguards around its AI chatbot,['@indianidle'],"April 5, 2023","Snapchat is launching new tools, including an age filter and insights for parents, to improve its AI chatbot. Days after Snapchat launched its GPT-powered chatbot for Snapchat+ subscribers, a Washington Post report highlighted that the bot was responding in an unsafe and inappropriate manner. Snap said it learned that people were trying to “trick the chatbot into providing responses that do not conform to our guidelines,” and the new tools are meant to keep the AI’s responses in check. The new age filter tells the chatbot its users’ birth dates and ensures it responds according to their age, the company said. In the coming weeks, Snap also plans to provide more insights to parents or guardians about children’s interactions with the chatbot in its Family Center, launched last August. The new feature will tell parents or guardians how their kids are communicating with the chatbot and the frequency of those interactions. Both the guardian and teens need to opt-in to using Family Center to use these parental control features. In a blog post, Snap explained that the My AI chatbot is not a “real friend,” and explained that it relies on conversation history to improve its responses. The company said that the bot only gave 0.01% of responses in “non-conforming” language. Snap counts any response that includes references to violence, sexually explicit terms, illicit drug use, child sexual abuse, bullying, hate speech, derogatory or biased statements, racism, misogyny, or marginalizing underrepresented groups as “non-conforming.” The company said that in most cases, inappropriate responses were the results of the bot parroting whatever the users said. It also said the firm will temporarily block AI bot access for users who misuse the service. “We will continue to use these learnings to improve My AI. This data will also help us deploy a new system to limit misuse of My AI. We are adding OpenAI’s moderation technology to our existing toolset, which will allow us to assess the severity of potentially harmful content and temporarily restrict Snapchatters’ access to My AI if they misuse the service,” Snap said. Snap is still pretty bullish on generative AI tools. Apart from the chatbot, the company introduced an AI-powered background generator that works through prompts for Snapchat+ subscribers a few weeks ago. Snapchat+ subscribers now have access to a background generator tool Image Credits: Snap Snapchat+ subscribers now have access to a background generator tool Image Credits: Snap Given the proliferation of AI-powered tools, many people are concerned about their safety and privacy. Last week, an ethics group called the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy wrote to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to pause the rollout of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, saying the tech was “biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety.” Last month, U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (Democrat of Colorado) also wrote a letter to OpenAI, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Snap expressing concerns about generative AI tools used by teens. It’s apparent these AI models are susceptible to harmful input and can be manipulated to output inappropriate responses. While tech companies might want to roll out these tools quickly, they will need to make sure there are enough guardrails to prevent their misuse."
75,Has the seed stage come back down to earth? It depends where you look,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"May 4, 2023","It’s been over a year since macroeconomic headwinds started wreaking havoc on venture capital. Late-stage startups were the first to feel the blow, but the impacts continued to creep lower as 2022 went on. Now in 2023, it seems the uncertainty has made its way down to the seed stage — for some companies, at least. Several seed investors have told TechCrunch+ they’ve seen a drop in outreach for seed deals and have seen valuations soften. But Q1 data from both PitchBook and Carta paints a slightly different picture: While Q1 was the slowest period for seed deals in 10 quarters, median and average deal sizes and median deal pre-money valuations were up compared to Q4 of 2022. But there’s an issue with tracking seed-stage deals: The data is almost never complete because these figures only include information on priced rounds and don’t include SAFEs. Considering SAFEs seem to make up the majority, if not a significant portion, of these early-stage deals, we aren’t getting the full picture. So what’s actually happening? "
76,"After bootstrapping for 15 years, energy renovation company Effy raises $22 million",['@romaindillet'],"March 30, 2023","Effy is at a crossroads. The energy renovation company based in France is doing well, but it is addressing a market that is much bigger than anticipated. That’s why it is making a bet. The company just closed a €20 million funding round (roughly $22 million at today’s exchange rate) from Felix Capital. This is the first external funding round for the company. “Our story starts 15 years ago,” founder and CEO Frédéric Utzmann told me. “We tackled this market very early on because we really believed in it.” At first, Effy wasn’t a tech-enabled startup. The company worked on energy renovation for public buildings, residential buildings and industrial facilities. “We started with heavy energy consuming projects with a business that was very much ‘brick and mortar,’ old school. But this allowed us to develop the company in a self-financed and profitable way,” Utzmann said. Quickly after that, the company started acquiring websites and services that were useful for energy renovation projects. In 2011, the company acquired Calculeo, a tool that helps you calculate how much you can get in public subsidies for energy renovation work. In 2015, Effy acquired Quelle énergie, a VC-backed startup that could calculate how much money you would save by insulating your roof, changing your windows and more. At the same time, Effy’s traffic started growing rapidly. Search engine optimizations led to more organic traffic. Effy started building a significant network of contractors and redirecting home owners to these partners. In 2019, Effy chose to focus exclusively on small residential projects. Engie acquired its B2B activities for an undisclosed amount. Effy chose to reinvest everything in product development and growth. In addition to organic traffic, the company spent some money on brand awareness ads (like TV spots), as well as Google and social media ads. And it has paid off, as Effy attracted 18 million visitors to its websites in 2022. Some people just want to use Effy’s tools to see how much money they could save with energy renovation projects. Others go one step further and submit a request for some construction work. Effy then contacts those potential customers to understand their needs. To give you a sense of Effy’s scale, last year, the company ended up contacting 500,000 individuals and completing 100,000 energy renovation projects. Effy handled €800 million in transactions on its platform. Effy can still improve its service in several ways. In particular, its marketplace is still mostly a lead generation product for energy renovation contractors. When potential clients want to move forward with their home projects, they are connected with independent contractors. These contractors supply quotes, which means that it creates some friction for the end customer. They have to compare quotes between multiple contractors and pick one. Of course, Effy spends a lot of time curating its marketplace. There are currently 3,800 contractors working with Effy. The company gathered 16,000 reviews and the average rating is 4.8 stars. Similarly, Effy can handle the paperwork to obtain subsidies for energy renovation work. The company takes a cut on this administrative process and charges contractors a small nominal fee for new potential clients. Effy now wants to switch to a first-party marketplace model. Clients interact directly with Effy and negotiate the quote with Effy. “Historically, we had an almost 100% third-party business — it represents 90% of our business today,” Utzmann said. It opens up some new possibilities on the product front. First, there are a lot of optimization possibilities when it comes to creating a quote, sourcing materials and everything that isn’t the construction work itself. This way, contractors can accept more jobs as Effy handles the rest. Second, Effy could start offering some financing options with partners. For small amounts, Effy can use “buy now, pay later” products. For bigger sums, Effy has an internal team that can negotiate credit lines with Sofinco and Cetelem. Sure, energy renovation projects can be expensive. But customers often end up paying smaller bills once these projects are done. Effy could even look at the impact on your bills thanks to smart meters. “Let’s say you pay €2,000 per year and you will pay €1,000 per year starting tomorrow. You could set aside €800 to pay back your investments. You end up saving less because you have to pay something back, but your house is also worth more money,” Utzmann said. In addition to this product roadmap, Effy’s business could end up growing rapidly thanks to favorable market conditions. The war in Ukraine has had a significant impact on energy bills. At the same time, the European Union wants to finance projects that have a positive impact on climate change. Residential buildings indirectly generate a ton of carbon emissions as it requires a lot of energy to heat and cool them. Many EU countries are rolling out generous subsidies to foster energy renovation projects. Finally, Effy is only available in France for now. The company could expand to other European countries in the future, starting with Germany and Spain."
77,There’s a new supply chain attack targeting customers of a phone system with 12 million users,['@carlypage_'],"March 30, 2023","Multiple security firms have sounded the alarm about an active supply chain attack that’s using a trojanized version of 3CX’s widely used voice and video-calling client to target downstream customers.  3CX is the developer of a software-based phone system used by more than 600,000 organizations worldwide, including BMW, McDonald’s and the U.K.’s National Health Service. The company claims to have more than 12 million daily users around the world.  Researchers from cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike, Sophos and SentinelOne on Wednesday published blog posts detailing a SolarWinds-style attack — dubbed “Smooth Operator” by SentinelOne — that involves the delivery of trojanized 3CXDesktopApp installers to install infostealer malware inside corporate networks. This malware is capable of harvesting system information and stealing data and stored credentials from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave and Firefox user profiles. Other observed malicious activity includes beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage payloads and, in a small number of cases, “hands-on-keyboard activity,” according to CrowdStrike. Security researchers report that attackers are targeting both the Windows and macOS versions of the compromised VoIP app. At present, it appears the Linux, iOS and Android versions are unaffected.  Researchers at SentinelOne said they first saw indications of malicious activity on March 22 and immediately investigated the anomalies, which led to the discovery that some organizations were trying to install a trojanized version of the 3CX desktop app that had been signed with a valid digital certificate. Apple security expert Patrick Wardle also found that Apple had notarized the malware, which means that the company checked it for malware and none was detected.  3CX CISO Pierre Jourdan said on Thursday that the company is aware of a “security issue” impacting its Windows and MacBook applications.  Jourdan notes that this appears to have been a “targeted attack from an Advanced Persistent Threat, perhaps even state-sponsored” hacker. CrowdStrike suggests that North Korean threat actor Labyrinth Chollima, a subgroup of the notorious Lazarus Group, is behind the supply-chain attack.   As a workaround, 3CX company is urging its customers to uninstall the app and install it again, or alternatively use its PWA client. “In the meantime we apologize profusely for what occurred and we will do everything in our power to make up for this error,” Jourdan said. There are a lot of things we don’t yet know about the 3CX supply-chain attack, including how many organizations have potentially been compromised. According to Shodan.io, a site that maps internet-connected devices, there are currently more than 240,000 publicly exposed 3CX phone management systems.  "
78,Databricks acquires AI-centric data governance platform Okera,['@fredericl'],"May 3, 2023","Databricks today announced that it has acquired Okera, a data governance platform with a focus on AI. The two companies did not disclose the purchase price. According to Crunchbase, Okera previously raised just under $30 million. Investors include Felicis, Bessemer Venture Partners, Cyber Mentor Fund, ClearSky and Emergent Ventures. Data governance was already a hot topic, but the recent focus on AI has highlighted some of the shortcomings of the previous approach to it, Databricks notes in today’s announcement. “Historically, data governance technologies, regardless of sophistication, rely on enforcing control at some narrow waist layer and require workloads to fit into the ‘walled garden’ at this layer,” the company explains in a blog post. That approach doesn’t work anymore in the age of large language models (LLMs) because the number of assets is growing too quickly (in part because so much of it is machine-generated) and because the overall AI landscape is changing so quickly, standard access controls aren’t able to capture these changes quickly enough. Okera then uses an AI-powered system that can automatically discover and classify personally identifiable information, tag it and apply rules to this (with a focus on the metadata), using a no-code interface. As the Databricks team stressed, that’s one of the reasons the company was interested in acquiring Okera, but the other is the service’s isolation technology, which can enforce governance control on arbitrary workloads without any major overhead. This technology is still in private preview but was likely one of the major reasons Databricks acquired the company. Databricks, which launched its own LLM a few weeks ago, plans to integrate Okera’s technology into its Unity Catalog, its existing governance solution of data and AI assets. The company also noted that the acquisition will enable Databricks to expose additional APIs that its own data governance partners will be able to use to provide solutions to their customers.   With this acquisition, Databricks is also bringing Okera co-founder and CEO Nong Li on board. Li created the Apache Parquet data storage format and was actually briefly an engineer at Databricks between working at Cloudera and before starting Okera, where he was the founding CTO and became the CEO in February 2022. “As data continues to grow in volume, velocity, and variety across different applications, CIOs, CDOs, and CEOs across the board have to balance those two often conflicting initiatives – not to mention that historically, managing access policies across multiple clouds has been painful and time-consuming,” writes Li in today’s announcement. “Many organizations don’t have enough technical talent to manage access policies at scale, especially with the explosion of LLMs. What they need is a modern, AI-centric governance solution. We could not be more excited to join the Databricks team and to bring our expertise in building secure, scalable and simple governance solutions for some of the world’s most forward-thinking enterprises.” If you know more about this acquisition, you can contact Frederic on Signal at (860) 208-3416 or by email (frederic@techcrunch.com).

79,Can’t watch without subtitles? Prime Video’s new feature makes dialogue easier to hear,['@sarahintampa'],"April 18, 2023","Can’t hear the TV anymore? You’re not alone. TV dialogue has gotten harder to understand over the years, leading everyone to turn subtitles on while watching. Today, that problem is top of mind as Amazon Prime Video introduces a new feature that may make subtitles no longer necessary — at least on some titles. It’s debuting “Dialogue Boost,” an option that allows Prime Video viewers to boost the volume of spoken dialogue relative to the background music and effects. The feature will first become available on select Amazon Original programs globally, including “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” “Harlem,” “The Big Sick,” “Being the Ricardos” and “Beautiful Boy,” among others. Similar features to increase the volume of dialogue are available on other platforms, like high-end theater systems, specialized audio equipment and some smart TVs and streaming media devices. Roku, for example, offers something called “speech clarity,” which also boosts dialogue content relative to other sounds, like background music or louder sound effects, like car crashes. But Amazon notes that it’s the first global streaming service to offer this type of feature. Though the option was first created with the needs of customers who are hard of hearing in mind, Amazon believes it may help everyone better enjoy its service. Image Credits: Amazon Image Credits: Amazon To create its Dialogue Boost tracks, Prime Video first analyzes the original audio in a movie or TV show and intelligently identifies the points where human speech is harder to hear above the background music and effects. Then, the speech patterns are isolated and the content is enhanced to make the dialogue clearer, Amazon tells TechCrunch. The company says the AI-driven approach is able to deliver targeted enhancement to portions of spoken dialogue, rather than general amplifications at the center channel in a home theater system. That means the boosted audio can be listened to on any device where Prime Video can be streamed, rather than being device-dependent like some other solutions. The boosted tracks are made available to end users to select from the subtitles and audio options widget on the playing video. Here, viewers will be able to select from options like “English Dialogue Boost: Medium” and “Dialogue Boost: High,” depending on their preferences. Prime Video users know if a title is available with a dialogue boost option as it will be displayed on the show or movie’s detail page on the service. Image Credits: Amazon Image Credits: Amazon At launch, the feature is available on roughly 100 Amazon Originals — though some only offer the option for select seasons. In addition to those shows noted above, Dialogue Boost is available on other titles like “Bosch,” “Fleabag,” “Modern Love” and “Crown Heights.” Amazon says it will continue to roll out to more titles in the future as it expands, but didn’t provide a time frame toward covering its full Originals library. “At Prime Video, we are committed to building an inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable streaming experience for all our customers,” said Raf Soltanovich, VP of Technology at Prime Video and Amazon Studios, in a statement about the launch. “Our library of captioned and audio-described content continues to grow, and by leveraging our technological capabilities to create industry-first innovations like Dialogue Boost, we are taking another step to create a more accessible streaming experience.” Prime Video isn’t the only service to address the issues around muffled audio, but rival Netflix recently took a different approach. Last month, Netflix introduced a feature that lets subscribers customize the size and style of subtitles and closed captions, in an acknowledgment as to how popular watching with subtitles has become. Dialogue Boost is available across all devices that support Prime Video, starting today."
80,Nocam unveils a social video app that’s like BeReal meets TikTok challenges,['@sarahintampa'],"April 20, 2023","A new social video app called Nocam has a radical idea to make social networking more authentic — it’s turning off the camera so you can’t see how you look while filming. The idea is to make capturing a moment feel natural while reducing the friction that comes with seeing a preview of your own image, which can often leave users hesitant to post or scrambling to add edits and filters to touch up their appearance. Nocam believes this concept better reflects the way people interact in real life, where we aren’t faced by a mirror that shows us what we look like, that is. “You know what you’re pointing at — why do you need to see this preview?,” asks Nocam’s co-founder and CEO Justin Spraggins. “The second you’re looking at what you’re about to capture, you get stuffy about it,” he says. “You’re now framing it — it doesn’t feel like it really is. You’re now performing in whatever way to create content.” Image Credits: Nocam Image Credits: Nocam The idea for Nocam evolved from the startup’s (Snack Break) earlier efforts with mobile social networking. Originally, the team launched a short-form video app called Popcorn, which aimed to make work communications more fun by letting users record short messages, or “pops,” that could be shared in lieu of longer emails, texts or Slacks. But in addition to facing steep competition from larger rivals like Loom, the team realized they weren’t well-equipped to target the enterprise market. Spraggins’ background is in the consumer world, having previously worked on apps Looksee and Unmute; most recently, he co-founded 9 Count, makers of Wink and others. “We failed fast and were like, this just doesn’t feel like us,” Spraggins explains of the pivot away from Popcorn. Because the team had stayed lean, they were able to use their existing fundraising to experiment with other app concepts. Last fall, for example, they were testing Peek, a photo widget app similar to Locket that had also removed the camera. But after initial tests and a small-scale rollout that reached only around 10,000 active users, the team shifted their focus to video instead. Image Credits: Nocam Image Credits: Nocam To use Nocam, users first authenticate with their phone number and allow the app to access their address book to find friends, similar to other social apps. You’ll then receive your first prompt to record a video. The whole concept in Nocam is around being prompted to record — but initially, the prompts will be system-driven. As you add more friends, you can receive prompts from them as well. So, for example, Nocam might prompt you to do a certain dance as a challenge, spin in a circle or just post what you’re up to right now. The prompts will include a random audio clip, and, when you start recording, the camera is blurred out. Clips are only a maximum of eight seconds in length to keep filming quick. Users also can add a caption and then press post to share it with their network — it’s not a direct message back to the friend that shared it with you. After you publish the video, you can see which friend prompted you to record or if it was a system-generated prompt. Friends can comment on videos that are posted and users can export their recordings to post on other social networks if they choose. Image Credits: Nocam Image Credits: Nocam Like BeReal, Nocam will send challenges at least once per day, but you also can get challenges from friends at any time. But while the app allows you to flip the camera, it doesn’t record from both cameras at once, as BeReal does. Still, the app has a very BeReal-like look and feel, even offering a calendar of your Nocam memories to look back through. “We think it’s very much like BeReal meets TikTok,” Spraggins says, noting how it combines both the system trigger found in BeReal with TikTok challenges, but in a more friend-centered app. While that may feel a bit derivative, it’s worth noting that BeReal has been losing steam — recent data from Sensor Tower indicate that BeReal’s monthly downloads have been slipping. In addition, daily usage has dropped 61% from its peak, down to 6 million users in March versus 15 million in October, Apptopia data found. That may signal that simply posting random photos of daily life is reaching its expiration point. Nocam’s differentiator to focus on video challenges could attract a similar demographic to BeReal while giving them something to actually do. Image Credits: Nocam Image Credits: Nocam The app has been heavily marketing itself on TikTok and Instagram, where it aims to appeal to a younger demographic. Though originally pitched to Gen Z college students, the goofy nature of its challenges appears to have attracted a slightly younger, high schooler crowd, where users may have the desire to connect with friends, but are often not actually with them out in the real world, as they are in college. Because of its 13+ rating, the app offers the ability for users to report others if they make inappropriate challenges or post terms-violating content. If a user is reported for their challenge, they’re banned from making their own challenges in the app. In addition, their violating content would be taken down, and the user who reported them will never see that person’s content again (and vice versa, in a double block). The startup is a team of three co-founders — including also CTO Ben Hochberg, previously a lead developer at 9 Count, and Gen Zer Sarah Tran, currently attending The Wharton School at UPenn. The company earlier raised pre-seed funding of $400,000 from General Catalyst and Dream Machine to test its different app concepts. After today’s official Nocam launch, it plans to raise a seed round.   Nocam is iOS-only for now and is a free download. The company doesn’t currently have a revenue model so there are no subscription fees or in-app purchases for the time being.  "
81,Everything you need to know about cloud outage insurance,['@abracarioca'],"April 21, 2023","Companies collectively spent $61 billion on cloud infrastructure in Q4 2022, and there’s more growth to come. Yet, businesses are poorly protected from losses caused by cloud downtime. “Cloud service providers typically offer service level agreements (SLAs) that outline their commitments to service availability and performance,” AV8 general partner Amir Kabir told TechCrunch+. But while penalties are usually involved should agreed-on service levels not be achieved, these rarely cover full losses that a cloud outage could cause its customers. Case in point: After millions of websites went offline after a major data center fire in France, a small online seller complained in the press that her cloud provider, OVHcloud, was only offering her a voucher worth a few months of free hosting — around $30, when she estimated the actual damage as closer to $2,000. For e-commerce businesses large and small, it is easy to see how cloud downtime can result in a loss of revenue. But cloud outages can have a negative revenue impact on businesses of all kinds, whether it is because of productivity loss, or because they have their own SLAs with customers to whom they may owe compensation. The usual corollary of risk is insurance against it, but when it comes to cloud downtime, the insurance sector hasn’t fully caught up yet. "
82,Kaszek earmarks nearly $1B in new funds for Latin American startups,['@bayareawriter'],"April 3, 2023","Kaszek Ventures, one of Latin America’s first venture firms, has raised $975 million across two funds. Specifically, the São Paulo-based firm has closed on Kaszek Ventures VI, a $540 million early-stage fund and Kaszek Ventures Opportunity-III (KVO-III), a $435 million vehicle for later stage investments.  In recent years, there has been an explosion of global investor interest in Latin American startups. The region’s startup scene saw a boom, with a large spike of fundraises in 2021 with VC capital deployed totaling $15.9 billion in 2021, (up from $2 billion in 2018) according to LAVCA. While that frenzy has tapered off some ($7.8 billion was deployed in 2022), Latin America is still home to a growing number of unicorns and successful startups. Since 2011, Kaszek has backed more than 120 companies, which the firm says collectively have raised more than $15.5 billion in capital.  Kaszek plans to put money in 20 to 30 companies out of its early-stage fund (at the seed, Series A and Series B stages), with check sizes ranging from $500,000 to $25 million, according to Hernán Kazah, Kaszek’s co-founder and a managing partner. Its Opportunity Fund investments will be more concentrated, with the firm aiming to back 10 to 15 companies with check sizes ranging from $10 million to $50 million. KVO-III will mostly provide later-stage capital to Kaszek’s portfolio companies but will also look for primary and secondary opportunities outside the firm’s early-stage portfolios, said Kazah. “We seek out exceptional founding teams whose business plan is centered on the strategic utilization of technology to gain a competitive advantage. We don’t limit ourselves to any specific sector,” Kazah said. Indeed, portfolio includes companies in a range of industries such as fintech, enterprise/SaaS, proptech, insuretech, health tech, edtech, e-commerce, food tech, climate tech, biotech and blockchain. They include Nubank, QuintoAndar, Kavak, Creditas, NuvemShop, Bitso, Gympass, Notco, MadeiraMadeira, Loggi, Konfio, Technisys, Kushki and Cora.  The firm’s most notable exit is digital bank Nubank, which it first invested in during the pre-seed round “when the company was merely a PowerPoint presentation,” said co-founder and managing partner Nicolas Szekasy. That company went public on the NYSE in December 2021. Geographically, Kaszek has been most active in Brazil and Mexico, and has also invested in teams based in Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay. MercadoLibre co-founder Kazah and the company’s ex-CFO, Szekasy, founded Kaszek 12 years ago after leaving what some describe as LatAm’s answer to Amazon. (The firm’s name comes from a combination of their two last names: Ka-Szek.) Rounding out the team are Nicolas Berman (former VP at MercadoLibre), Santiago Fossatti, Andy Young, Mariana Donangelo and Angie Udry. Image Credits: Kaszek Image Credits: Kaszek Kaszek founded its first fund in 2011, raising $95 million, an impressive sum at that time. Funds II and III closed in 2014 and 2017, raising $135 million and $200 million, respectively. By 2019, Kaszek had closed on its fourth fund, raising $375 million and its first Opportunity Fund, reserving $225 million for later-stage investing in existing portfolio companies. It last raised funds in 2021, $475 million for early-stage investing and $525 million for its opportunity fund. According to the firm, each of its two new funds were “oversubscribed.”  The firm’s LP base remains consistent with that of its previous funds, according to Kazah, and is made up of university endowments, philanthropic foundations, technology investors and entrepreneurs around the world.  In 2022, said Szekasy, most companies in Latin America “used the year to re-calibrate their plans, and traded-off some top line growth to improve margins and establish a path to profitability.” “Looking forward to 2023, pipeline opportunities are robust,” added Kazah. “The technology sector has faced some short- to mid-term pressure globally due to recent market adjustments. However, it is important to note that long-term trends in this sector remain unchanged. In fact, historically, some of the most iconic and successful companies have been built during times of scarcity and economic uncertainty.” "
83,Italy orders ChatGPT blocked citing data protection concerns,['@riptari'],"March 31, 2023","Two days after an open letter called for a moratorium on the development of more powerful generative AI models so regulators can catch up with the likes of ChatGPT, Italy’s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people’s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it’s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation. Specifically, the Garante said it has issued the order to block ChatGPT over concerns OpenAI has unlawfully processed people’s data as well as over the lack of any system to prevent minors from accessing the tech. The San Francisco-based company has 20 days to respond to the order, backed up by the threat of some meaty penalties if it fails to comply. (Reminder: Fines for breaches of the EU’s data protection regime can scale up to 4% of annual turnover, or €20 million, whichever is greater.) It’s worth noting that since OpenAI does not have a legal entity established in the EU, any data protection authority is empowered to intervene, under the GDPR, if it sees risks to local users. (So where Italy steps in, others may follow.) Update: OpenAI has now geoblocked ChatGPT in Italy — see our follow-on report for more details.  The GDPR applies whenever EU users’ personal data is processed. And it’s clear OpenAI’s large language model has been crunching this kind of information, since it can, for example, produce biographies of named individuals in the region on-demand (we know; we’ve tried it). Although OpenAI declined to provide details of the training data used for the latest iteration of the technology, GPT-4, it has disclosed that earlier models were trained on data scraped from the Internet, including forums such as Reddit. So if you’ve been reasonably online, chances are the bot knows your name. Moreover, ChatGPT has been shown producing completely false information about named individuals, apparently making up details its training data lacks. That potentially raises further GDPR concerns, since the regulation provides Europeans with a suite of rights over their data, including the right to rectification of errors. It’s not clear how/whether people can ask OpenAI to correct erroneous pronouncements about them generated by the bot, for example. The Garante‘s statement also highlights a data breach the service suffered earlier this month, when OpenAI admitted a conversation history feature had been leaking users’ chats, and said it may have exposed some users’ payment information. Data breaches are another area the GDPR regulates with a focus on ensuring entities that process personal data are adequately protecting the information. The pan-EU law also requires companies to notify relevant supervisory authorities of significant breaches within tight time-periods. Overarching all this is the big(ger) question of what legal basis OpenAI has relied upon for processing Europeans’ data in the first place. In other words, the lawfulness of this processing. The GDPR allows for a number of possibilities — from consent to public interest — but the scale of processing to train these large language models complicates the question of legality. As the Garante notes (pointing to the “mass collection and storage of personal data”), with data minimization being another big focus in the regulation, which also contains principles that require transparency and fairness. Yet, at the least, the (now) for-profit company behind ChatGPT does not appear to have informed people whose data it has repurposed to train its commercial AIs. That could be a pretty sticky problem for it. If OpenAI has processed Europeans’ data unlawfully, DPAs across the bloc could order the data to be deleted, although whether that would force the company to retrain models trained on data unlawfully obtained is one open question as an existing law grapples with cutting edge tech. On the flip side, Italy may have just banned all machine learning by, er, accident… 😬 “[T]he Privacy Guarantor notes the lack of information to users and all interested parties whose data is collected by OpenAI but above all the absence of a legal basis that justifies the mass collection and storage of personal data, for the purpose of ‘training’ the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform,” the DPA wrote in its statement today [which we’ve translated from Italian using AI]. “As evidenced by the checks carried out, the information provided by ChatGPT does not always correspond to the real data, thus determining an inaccurate processing of personal data,” it added. The authority added that it is concerned about the risk of minors’ data being processed by OpenAI since the company is not actively preventing people under the age of 13 from signing up to use the chatbot, such as by applying age verification technology. Risks to children’s data is an area where the regulator has been very active, recently ordering a similar ban on the virtual friendship AI chatbot, Replika, over child safety concerns. In recent years, it has also pursued TikTok over underage usage, forcing the company to purge over half-a-million accounts it could not confirm did not belong to kids. So if OpenAI can’t definitively confirm the age of any users it’s signed up in Italy, it could, at the very least, be forced to delete their accounts and start again with a more robust sign-up process. OpenAI was contacted for a response to the Garante‘s order. Lilian Edwards, an expert in data protection and Internet law at Newcastle University who has been ahead of the curve in conducting research on the implications of “algorithms that remember,” told TechCrunch: “What’s fascinating is that it more or less copy-pasted Replika in the emphasis on access by children to inappropriate content. But the real time-bomb is denial of lawful basis, which should apply to ALL or at least many machine learning systems, not just generative AI.” She pointed to the pivotal ‘right to be forgotten’ case involving Google search, where a challenge was brought to its consentless processing of personal data by an individual in Spain. But while European courts established a right for individuals to ask search engines to remove inaccurate or outdated information about them (balanced against a public interest test), Google’s processing of personal data in that context (internet search) did not get struck down by EU regulators over the lawfulness of processing point, seemingly on the grounds that it was providing a public utility. But also, ultimately, because Google ended up providing rights of erasure and rectification to EU data subjects. “Large language models don’t offer those remedies and it’s not entirely clear they would, could or what the consequences would be,” Edwards added, suggesting that enforced retraining of models may be one potential fix. Or, well, that technologies like ChatGPT may simply have broken data protection law… This report was updated with additional comment. We also fixed a misspelling of the regulator’s name.    "
84,"Hype grows for SpaceX’s Starship orbital flight test, but barriers remain",['@breadfrom'],"April 4, 2023","More and more hype is building for the first orbital flight test of Starship, SpaceX’s ultra-heavy launch system. That hype has started to reach a crescendo this week as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released an air traffic advisory identifying April 10 as a primary launch date. Adding gasoline to the fire, earlier today SpaceX CEO Elon Musk liked a tweet that simply reads “April 10” with a GIF of a rocket launching. While April 10 is shaping up to be the closest we’ve come to an even semi-solid launch date, the FAA has yet to issue the all-important launch license to SpaceX. This final regulatory green-light is a nonnegotiable step before the company can conduct the test. As of yet, there’s been no indication that that license is imminently forthcoming. Further, as Ars Technica science editor Eric Berger pointed out on Twitter, there is also a very real possibility of a civil suit being filed over environmental issues immediately following the issuance of the launch license. In this case, a judge would have the power to issue a temporary injunction blocking the flight test until that civil suit is resolved. It would not be the first time SpaceX and environmentalists have clashed over the company’s activities at Starbase, the Starship development facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Immediately surrounding Starbase are wildlife refuges and a state park, both home to what environmentalists say are fragile ecosystems that could be existentially threatened by ongoing orbital operations. The FAA published its final environmental assessment of Starbase and the Starship flight program last summer, finding that SpaceX’s plans would not result in significant impacts to the environment and requiring the company to complete a number of mitigation measures before flight testing begins. The Starship launch system is composed of a Super Heavy booster and an upper stage that’s also named Starship. The rocket has become critical to the future of the space economy, with multiple startups banking on it coming online for their business plans, as well as to NASA, which has made it a centerpiece of its Artemis program to return humans to the moon — not to mention its centrality to Musk’s own vision of expanding humanity to Mars."
85,"Despite regulatory concerns, the US is far from losing its venture crown","['Alex Wilhelm', 'Natasha Mascarenhas']","April 19, 2023","Coinbase is open to leaving the United States in the wake of a regulatory dispute with the government. A tone shift of that magnitude could have an impact on where the future of tech is being built and the opportunity of the global venture market ahead. The Coinbase news does not exist in a vacuum. Various agencies of the U.S. government are taking a more aggressive posture on cryptocurrencies and digital assets and securities more generally — evidenced by a flurry of recent actions — while concern that developers are heading for the border pick up steam. The U.S. could, in time, shed some of its prominence in the crypto market if trends continue. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. But not so fast: Crypto may be something of an outlier (more on this later), and even then we have to heavily caveat the idea that the United States is in real danger of losing its place as the leading location to build tech companies. Don’t take our word for it. Instead, we can learn quite a lot from venture capital investments themselves. Given that VCs are expected to be expert investors with a finger on the pulse of what’s next, where they place bets should be a good indicator of where there are hot spots of innovation and optimism."
86,"Post, a publisher-focused Twitter alternative, launches to public",['@sarahintampa'],"April 3, 2023","Post, a Twitter alternative of sorts that’s rethinking how publishers should engage with social media — and how they should monetize their readership — has opened its doors to the public. The startup, like others in this space, gained ground in the wake of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter as many began to look for a new place to read and discuss the news or share their own thoughts with their followers. But Post doesn’t want to be just another Twitter clone. Instead, its aim is to develop a platform where publishers can generate revenue from micropayments — that is, where users pay some small amount of money to read individual news items. This could include articles from traditional media outlets that would otherwise have been behind some kind of subscription-based paywall, but it could also include other types of media, like subscription newsletters, or even free and ad-supported content that’s offered elsewhere. The latter has been the source of some criticism for Post, along the lines of “who would pay for news that you could get for free elsewhere?” But that response conveniently forgets the miserable experience that is reading free news on today’s web. Ads and in-house promos are everywhere — even in the middle of articles as you scroll down. Videos autoplay, often in their own pop-up windows. Cookie consent banners appear, trying to trick you into agreeing to hand over more data. Prompts to buy a subscription or sign up for the publishers’ newsletter pop up over the top of the screen, forcing you to dismiss them. Explains Post’s founder and CEO Noam Bardin, previously CEO of Waze at Google, Post’s partnered publishers have already found that users want to read news in their feed, rather than jumping out to external websites — even if it’s more expensive to do so.  Image Credits: Post screenshot Image Credits: Post screenshot “You go to many news sites today and you get bombarded by these ads, email capture forms and subscriptions…you just wanted to read one article. And you wanted to read it because someone shared it. So, a one-time transaction, but you’re bombarded,” he says. “We think that with a great user experience, the right pricing and the lack of friction, we can add a new business model to the world of ads [or] subscription.” Bardin tells TechCrunch that, when speaking with publishers, they generally agreed with the startup’s thesis — that the current subscription structure, outside of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal — is not good for publishers. They acknowledged that the website traffic from social media shares doesn’t often convert visitors to subscribers and that subscribers account for only a fraction of their larger readership. “Everyone agrees there’s a problem. No one wants to be first,” he says, speaking of Post’s initial struggles with publisher adoption. The Post website itself first launched in November 2022 into a closed beta that grew to 650,000 people on its waitlist. Of those, 430,000 people actually created an account. That’s when publishers took notice. As Post now enters its public beta period, Twitter is bent on angering publishers by stripping their Verified badges if they don’t pay. Post instead is offering to pay publishers. That has some draw. The company today has 25 premium publishers on board and several hundred in various stages. Some, like local news publishers, are waiting on additional functionality to be added to the platform. At launch, Post has signed up partners including The Boston Globe, The Brookings Institution, Fortune, The Independent, Insider, LA Times, NBC News, Politico, ProPublica, Reuters, Semafor, SF Chronicle, MIT Technology Review, USA Today, Wired, World Politics Review and Yahoo Finance. Image Credits: Post screenshot Image Credits: Post screenshot Some of these outlets are posting manually, while others are experimenting with micropayments, and some are doing both. Those who have tried the micropayments option include Fortune, The Independent, LA Times, Reuters, MIT Technology Review, USA Today and Wired. Bardin claims the average CPMs publishers are getting from Post’s platform is $25 for a paid post. The highest article got a $300 CPM. But, he adds, publishers are also making an average of $1.30 CPMs from their free posts by way of donations and tips. The micropayments platform Post users, which is powered by Stripe, allows users to buy a bundle of points in packets of 300 ($4.20) up to 10,000 ($126.70). As you get into the higher tiers — 1,500, 5,000 or 10,000 points, you’ll get a discount on your purchase. Post generates revenue by taking a small percentage of these sales, similar to Twitch. Image Credits: Post screenshot Image Credits: Post screenshot Bardin isn’t sharing Post’s current active user base figures but says that when people run out of their 50 free points gifted at sign-up, 80% have entered their credit card information to buy more. That’s a promising number, but it’s still early days for this startup. Twitter, after all, never gained mass market appeal and Twitter alternatives have an even tougher hill to climb as they try to attract a mainstream user base. What a publisher chooses to charge for their articles is up to them — we’ve seen as low as 1 point (see image on right), and as high as 89 points when scrolling our feed. Over time, Post plans to add other payment options, like “pay what you want” (which could also include paying nothing, if you choose), a “buy one, share one” option and an option where the first few articles per month are free. The site, similar to pre-Elon Twitter, also has a number of rules around user behavior. It will kick people out for breaking them but doesn’t yet know how it will draw the line between temporary and permanent bans. Its “freedom of speech” approach — a matter of much consternation in the Elon era — is fairly simple. “When it comes to people, you do not have a right to be an asshole. That’s not a God-given right in the Constitution. So, if you want to, go somewhere else. We don’t need you. You don’t have to be an asshole here.” In addition, Post aims to leverage AI technologies to personalize the news feed to its end users — an idea also now being tried by Artifact, the news app from Instagram’s co-founders. Post also expects that, as a news feed experience, many of its users won’t be active content creators themselves. In fact, there’s an old internet adage that says most people on a service consume content, but don’t engage or create. Yet that large majority is often forgotten when services are being built. “They don’t publish. You don’t hear them,” says Bardin. But, he adds, “they, in many ways, are the audience.” “Seventy-five percent of Twitter users have never tweeted,” he continues. “People use it to consume information, but it’s built for the people creating the information…there are a lot of things that I think we would all have done differently with Twitter if we started out today.” Post’s service as it stands today reflects that philosophy. It’s more of a place to scroll and read the news but lacks the active conversations about the news that happens on larger platforms like Twitter, or even newer alternatives like T2 or Mastodon. But that engagement may come in time, as Post intends to eventually adopt ActivityPub — the protocol that powers the open source, decentralized Mastodon and the broader Fediverse. As an interconnected app, Post could gain more active usage. “We started out building on Mastodon…We love what Mastodon is doing,” Bardin tells us. “And Bluesky is another approach, but the same concept,” he says. “We will be adding integration with Mastodon and others.” That’s still much further down the road — it’s not in the works for 2023, we understand. “We just started the company in May. We’ve been around less than a year. We’ve got a lot of stuff we want to do — we don’t want to limit ourselves to supporting other protocols at this stage. Once we’ve built the core and we like it, then we can see exactly how these protocols can or cannot plug in,” Bardin says. Post quietly dropped its invite requirement a couple of weeks ago, but hadn’t yet formally announced its public beta launch. While the startup isn’t talking about active usage, the site saw its traffic peak with over 5.19 million monthly visits in December 2022, according to data from Similarweb. That’s since fallen to 921,000+ visits in March 2023 (as of March 27th). The firm estimates Post had around 946,120 total daily users in the last 28 days. Not bad for the crowded alt-Twitter market these days, where Mastodon now has 1.2 million monthly actives, for comparison. Based in New York with a distributed team of 20, including co-founder Noel Baron, Post raised a seed round from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), as well as Scott Galloway, an NYU professor and tech commentator. Silicon Valley journalist Kara Swisher also said she advises the startup. The company isn’t currently raising but is hiring.  "
87,Climate tech tapped the brakes in Q1. Will the slowdown continue?,['@tdechant'],"April 6, 2023","For the last two years, climate tech was on a tear. To be fair, so were a lot of other sectors. But when a slowdown hit tech investing in the middle of last year, climate tech startups bucked the trend and kept racking up the deals. Now the party might be over, if preliminary data from a new report holds up. Climate tech deal-making in the first quarter registered $5.7 billion across 279 deals, according to a new PitchBook report. The amount raised was down 36% year over year with 35% fewer deals. That’s certainly suggestive of a correction. Investors have been keeping a closer eye on their pocketbooks as fears of a recession continue to rumble through the markets. And yet key economic indicators show a striking resilience in the U.S. economy, with strong hiring keeping unemployment low while consumer sentiment remains high. That hasn’t stopped economists and big names on Wall Street from continuing to predict a recession in the coming months. (Certainly not the first time they’ve done that.) Still, all that noise tends to give investors the jitters. Since no one wants to be left holding the bag, investor sentiment has a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you’re a startup squeezed for cash, you’ve undoubtedly heard from your investors, and it may feel like a recession is already here. Yet climate tech’s resilience has led some to call it the ultimate “recession proof” investment. Is that still true? Maybe. Let’s break it down. For one, these are preliminary figures looking at data through March 31. It’s hard to say how many deals closed in the last few days of the quarter that weren’t picked up by this report. It might be billions!"
88,"Amid a boom in AI accelerators, a UC Berkeley-focused outfit, House Fund, swings open its doors",['@cookie'],"April 4, 2023","Companies at the forefront of AI would naturally like to stay at the forefront, so it’s no surprise they want to stay close to smaller startups that are putting some of their newest advancements to work. Last month, Neo, a startup accelerator founded by Silicon Valley investor Ali Partovi, said that OpenAI and Microsoft have offered to provide free software and advice to companies in a new track focused on artificial intelligence. Now, another Bay Area outfit, House Fund, which invests in startups with ties to UC Berkeley, says it is launching an AI accelerator and that OpenAI, Microsoft and Databricks are similarly offering participating startups free and early access to tech from their companies. The outfits are also offering mentorship, as is Google’s Gradient Ventures. We talked with House Fund founder Jeremy Fiance over the weekend to get a bit more color about the program, which will replace a broader accelerator program that House Fund has run. Alumni from the previous program include additive manufacturing software company, Dyndrite, and managed app development platform Crowdbotics, which has raised more than $60 million so far. House Fund’s new AI accelerator program will run for two months, kicking off in early July and ending in early September. Around six companies will be accepted, and the early application deadline is April 13, with the final application deadline being June 1. As for the time commitment involved across those two months, every startup could have a different experience, says Fiance. “We’re there when you need us, and we’re good at staying out of the way.” There will be a retreat to help kick off the program where founders can get to know one another. Candidates who are accepted will also have access to some of UC Berkeley’s AI professors, including Michael Jordan, Ion Stoica, and Trevor Darrell. Founders can opt in for dinners and events in collaboration with these various constituents. As for some of the financials, every startup that goes through the program will receive a $1 million investment on a $10 million post-money SAFE note. Importantly, as with the House Fund’s venture dollars, its AI accelerator is seeking startups that have at least one Berkeley-affiliated founder on the co-founding team. That can include alumni, faculty, PhDs, postdocs, staff, students, dropouts and other affiliates. There is no demo day. Instead, Fiance says founders will receive “directed, personal introductions” to the VCs who are the best fit for their startups. Given the buzz over AI, the new program could supercharge House Fund, which is already growing fast. Fiance launched it in 2016 with just $6 million and the firm now manages $300 million in assets on behalf of Berkeley Endowment Management Company and the University of California, among others. At the same time, the competition is fierce and growing fiercer by the day. Though OpenAI has offered to partner with House Fund, for example, the San Francisco-based company announced its own accelerator back in November. Called Converge, the cohort was to be made up of 10 or so founders who would receive $1 million each and admission to five weeks of office hours, workshops and other events, and would be funded by the OpenAI Startup Fund. Y Combinator, the biggest accelerator in the world, is also oozing with AI startups right now. All of them are part of a winter class that will be talking directly with investors this week via demo days that will happen this week from April 5 to April 6."
89,India’s anti-money laundering agency searches edtech giant Byju’s offices,['@refsrc'],"April 29, 2023","India’s crime-fighting agency searched three premises of edtech giant Byju’s and its founder Byju Raveendran, it said Saturday, and seized various “incriminating” documents and digital data. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said it conducted the searches under the provisions of the nation’s anti-money laundering law FEMA, but declined to elaborate. The agency has conducted several similar probes in recent months, including at crypto firms WazirX and CoinSwitch Kuber, phonemaker Vivo and news broadcaster the BBC. The agency said “various” complaints from private individuals prompted the investigation. As part of the probe into Byju’s, which is ongoing, ED said it summoned Raveendran “several” times but the founder “remained evasive and never appeared during the investigation.” The probe has so far found that Byju’s raised about $3.4 billion in foreign direct investment during the period of 2011 to 2023. During this period, the startup remitted about $1.1 billion to foreign entities and labeled about $115 million as advertisement and marketing expense. It appears that part of what prompted ED to conduct the investigation was the delayed filing of annual financials by Byju’s. The so-called findings — how much money Byju’s raised, and later invested in overseas units — have been widely disclosed by Byju’s and reported by media earlier. “The company has not prepared its financial statements since financial year 2020-21 and has not got the accounts audited, which is mandatory. Hence, the genuineness of the figures provided by the company are being cross examined from the banks,” ED said in a statement Sunday. The Bengaluru-headquartered Byju’s, which is India’s most valuable startup and which counts BlackRock, Sequoia India, Lightspeed Venture Partners India and UBS among its backers, termed the searches by the agency as “a routine inquiry,” and said the startup maintains complete transparency with the authorities and has provided all the information that was requested. “We have nothing but the utmost confidence in the integrity of our operations, and we are committed to upholding the highest standards of compliance and ethics. We will continue to work closely with the authorities to ensure that they have all the information they need, and we are confident that this matter will be resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. We want to emphasize that it is business as usual at Byju’s,” a spokesperson of Byju’s legal team said in a statement. “We are committed to delivering high-quality educational products and services to our customers across India and the world.” ED’s statement comes at a time when Byju’s is closing a large funding round and is gearing up for the IPO of its subsidiary unit physical tutor chain Aakash."
90,New Tears of the Kingdom video shows Zelda doubling down on an interactive world,['@tayhatmaker'],"March 28, 2023","One of Breath of the Wild’s best features is coming back in a big way. In a new preview of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, producer Eiji Aonuma shows off 10 minutes of gameplay from the eagerly anticipated (to put it lightly) sequel to 2017’s hit. The video dips into a little bit of low-level combat and includes some running around, but mostly it goes over new systems designed to encourage the kind of emergent gameplay that made Breath of the Wild such a joy to discover for so many people. In the first game, you could sail high on the updrafts created by grass on fire, get struck by lightning if you were wearing metal armor or cook a steak by throwing meat on the ground near a volcano. Many of the game’s environmental features were interactive and its shrine puzzles in particular nudged players to test out potential combinations of abilities, objects and their properties to come up with clever solutions. Happily, all of that looks to be back and then some in the new game. Breath of the Wild introduced Stasis and Magnesis, two abilities that invited players to bend physics and move stuff around in dynamic ways. In Tears of the Kingdom, we’ll be getting at least two brand new tricks like those, one called Fuse and another known as Ultra Hand. First, some bad news. The new gameplay video confirms that Tears of the Kingdom will again give Link flimsy, destructible weapons that explode after giving enemies a few whacks. The good news is that players can create their own weapons from items in the game world — and hopefully at least a few of those combinations are more durable than last time around. With the new Fuse ability, Link can splice together a giant makeshift hammer using a branch and a boulder or grab a long stick and combine it with a pitchfork for a really, reaaaally long pitchfork (if this is Zelda humor, we’re here for it). Other combos are less obvious: Merging a monster eyeball with an arrow creates a homing arrow that can track your quarry and shoot it out of the sky. A similar ability called Ultra Hand will let Link pick up heavy items and arrange them into something new. In the demo, Aonuma shows this off by creating a wind-powered airboat out of some big fans that happened to be laying around Hyrule and some logs. The same ability will apparently let players create all kinds of vehicles, including cars and flying machines. Aside from the two new core abilities, Link won’t have to spend so much time slogging his way up mountains this time around. Aonuma demonstrated a new mobility trick that lets Link swim up through any space with a ceiling, including buildings and apparently the giant caves within the game’s many peaks. The emphasis on verticality tracks with the sky islands and otherwise very high up environments we’ve seen before in prior previews. The new Tears of the Kingdom video packs a lot of promise into a brief 10 minutes. If you loved the environmental puzzle solving and clever interactions in Breath of the Wild, the upcoming game — due out on May 12 — looks like it will offer an even bigger scope of possibilities."
91,Flipboard expands Mastodon support to its Android application,['@sarahintampa'],"March 30, 2023","Magazine app Flipboard is integrating Mastodon in its Android application, as the company broadens its commitment to the federated social web. Flipboard CEO Mike McCue will also demonstrate the app’s new Mastodon support in a session this morning at FediForum, an online event dedicated to discussions surrounding the challenges facing the Fediverse — the group of interconnected servers powering a range of open source, decentralized applications, including the newly popular Twitter alternative Mastodon. Last month, Flipboard first announced it was joining the Fediverse with plans to integrate with Mastodon, launch its own Mastodon instance, flipboard.social and, later, add support for ActivityPub — the protocol powering Fediverse apps like Mastodon, which has benefited from the chaos surrounding Twitter after Elon Musk’s acquisition. Following its announcement, Flipboard’s Mastodon community now has around 500 active members who have established accounts in order to participate on the decentralized social platform. In addition, Flipboard is rolling out support for Mastodon in its own app, allowing users to browse a feed of short updates from the people they follow, reply to, like and boost posts, as well as click on hashtags to follow discussions, among other things. In part, the integration is meant to plug a potential hole in Flipboard’s server if and when its Twitter API access stops working. That’s a heightened concern under Musk’s Twitter management, as the company overnight ripped away API access from a number of apps with no warning and recently changed the pricing, making it out of reach for many developers. However, Flipboard’s Mastodon integration was originally iOS-only. Today, Android support is also now available. As on iPhone, Android users can now find the new feature by navigating over the accounts section and then logging in with their Mastodon credentials for the instance they’re on. And if the user doesn’t yet have a Mastodon account, they can request access to join Flipboard’s own server from here. Image Credits: Flipboard Image Credits: Flipboard Following its rollout of Mastodon integration, Flipboard added functionality that lets users follow other people, hashtags or feeds directly from the Flipboard app, and added the latest Mastodon posts to Flipboard users’ For You feed. It also made it possible for users to access their Mastodon bookmarks and @mentions from within its app and add them to the list of followed items on Flipboard. Combined, these features make Mastodon a larger part of the Flipboard experience. While not as robust as some other clients like Tapbots’ Ivory or Mozilla-backed Mammoth, it’s possible to browse and use Mastodon by way of Flipboard — which may be enough for more casual users. Perhaps just as important is the larger commitment the company is making to the federated social web, which includes being an active participant in the conversations that are happening around the future of decentralization. For instance, the event where McCue spoke today — FediForum — is a small, online “unconference” where ideas are discussed and shared. As noted during the wrap-up on day one, other non-ActivityPub projects were invited to attend, like Jack Dorsey-backed Bluesky, but they declined. “We’re big believers in the innovation and growth coming from the Fediverse. As more apps and platforms embrace federated social networks like Mastodon, this ecosystem will increasingly become a viable alternative to today’s ‘walled garden’ social media networks,” said McCue. “Our current integration with Mastodon gives a glimpse into how the ActivityPub protocol can lead to more connected services and expansion of the Fediverse.” Flipboard’s embrace of the Fediverse follows a similar announcement from the blogging platform Medium, which recently launched its own Mastodon community for its authors. Other companies that have weighted various Fediverse integrations include Tumblr and Flickr, both of which have discussed adding support for ActivityPub, as well. WordPress.com owner Automattic (which also owns Tumblr) earlier this month acquired an ActivityPub plugin so blogs can join the Fediverse."
92,Halcyon lands large investment to defend against ransomware,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 20, 2023","Following the Colonial Pipeline incident in 2021, Jon Miller and Ryan Smith wondered why, with the widespread adoption of security tools, ransomware was still growing exponentially. It’s an odd dichotomy. Seventy-eight percent of companies responding to a recent survey said that they plan to increase their investments in cybersecurity in the next 12 months. But at the same time, ransomware damages are expected to exceed $30 billion worldwide in 2023. Frustrated with the status quo, Miller and Smith — veterans of companies later acquired by Blackberry and Optiv, as well as cyber defense contractor Boldend — founded the cybersecurity startup Halcyon. They claim it can help stop ransomware from causing damage while enabling companies to lower their overall recovery times. It’s a message that’s seemingly resonating with VCs. Halcyon today announced that it raised $44 million in a Series A funding round (plus $6 million in debt) led by SYN Ventures and Corner Ventures, with participation from Dell Technologies Capital. The new cash and loan, Miller said, will be put toward bolstering the company’s engineering and R&D departments and strengthening its ongoing sales and marketing outreach. “We view our product as unique in that we have no direct competitors, and in fact want to improve other security tools in use by our customers,” Miller, who serves as CEO, said. “We assume first that all security layers will fail at some point, including our own. That’s why we have focused on building a product with resilience in mind.” Miller might assert that Halcyon is without direct competitors. But the cybersecurity space — which has seen funding fall consistently, with dealmaking reaching a two-year low in the most recent fiscal quarter, according to Crunchbase — is overflowing with vendors. The financial crunch threatens to turn up the heat even higher. But Miller patiently lays out what he sees as Halcyon’s market-beating differentiators. For one, the platform taps AI to recognize “malicious intent,” trained on a data set of millions of real-world ransomware events. That’s as opposed to the static, rules-based detection schemes that some cybersecurity platforms use, Miller says. “To build detection engine models, security companies will ingest millions of samples, indicators and artifacts from a variety of sources,” he added. “We have started much more narrowly in order to not pollute our models with data not relevant to ransomware campaigns or broken samples like those commonly pulled from public malware repositories.” Halcyon attempts to detect and block known bad executables like off-the-shelf commodity ransomware and pass unknown but suspicious executables to additional “protection layers” for further analysis. In addition, the platform attempts to “trick” ransomware into aborting or revealing an attack by exploiting features hardcoded in the ransomware software itself — triggering code via deception techniques. Halcyon’s other unique component is a “resiliency layer” that kicks in if the platform’s detection and prevent layers fail. As Miller describes it, the resilience layer captures the encryption keys generated during the attack, allowing IT and security teams with a way to automatically decrypt the impacted endpoints — rendering the attack useless. Typically during a ransomware attack, attackers encrypt various endpoints on a network — for example, laptops — and demand ransom in exchange for decryption. Halcyon’s approach sounds like a clever way to combat this. That’s assuming that it works as well as Miller says, of course. Halcyon’s platform taps AI to attempt to detect and block ransomware.

Image Credits: Halcyon In any case, Halcyon has attracted considerable interest from investors, having raised a total of $50 million since 2020 inclusive of the Series A. Miller says that business was briefly impacted by the Silicon Valley Bank collapse — Halcyon was a corporate credit card and loan customer with the bank — but that Halcyon has since “diversified its banking relationships” to better manage risk. With a customer base of around 51 companies, Halcyon plans to grow the size of its workforce from 75 people to around 100 by the end of the year. In terms of product, Miller says that Halcyon will launch a data exfiltration tool to stop the “double extortion” techniques commonly used by ransomware groups today as well as support for additional operating systems including Linux and Mac. Double extortion attacks usually involve hackers that threaten to encrypt sensitive data and publish it on the dark web or sell it to the highest bidder. “With the growth of ransomware operations and the economy that supports them, gaining access to credentials and systems is easier and cheaper than ever before,” Miller said. “Products that do not start with an approach that prioritizes resilience will generate more risks to the business and higher cyber insurance premiums which have an impact across all aspects of the organization.” Miller wouldn’t reveal Halcyon’s revenue when asked, and, when pressed on why the company raised debt, said only that it was for “flexibility” in the near term. But if surveys are anything to go by, demand for Halcyon’s product won’t wane anytime soon — which could be good news for the bottom line. A survey by CyberCatch found that 75% of companies wouldn’t be able to survive a ransomware attack. Another poll, this by Mimecast, shows that 47% of companies have been successfully attacked by ransomware. Considering they’re coming from vendors, is there an element of fear-mongering in those numbers? Perhaps. But fear does sell, it’s true."
93,Indian edtech giant Byju’s not acquiring Unacademy,['@refsrc'],"March 23, 2023","Indian edtech giant Byju’s said on Thursday the firm and any of its subsidiaries are not engaging with rival Unacademy to explore an acquisition or merger, refuting a media report at a time when weakening global market conditions have sparked several consolidation plays in the industry. Indian news outlet MoneyControl reported earlier that Byju’s physical tutor unit Aakash is in talks to merge with Unacademy. “We strongly deny that Byju’s is considering a merger of Unacademy into Aakash Educational Services. As a parent company, BYJU’S is committed to investing in the growth of Aakash Educational Services, which is growing at more than 50% year-on-year,” a Byju’s spokesperson said in a statement. “We have had absolutely no discussions with Unacademy or any other player to merge with Aakash Educational Services. Aakash is a market leader in our segment with an impeccable track record of delivery and results and we are focused on our organic growth and delivery to the lakhs of students that have trusted us,” an Aakash spokesperson said. Valued at $3.44 billion, SoftBank-backed Unacademy is one of the largest edtech startups in India. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup has significantly cut its expenses as the startup pushes to become profitable in the coming quarters. Unacademy “always raised more money than what was needed” to “continuously experiment and grow our platform without worrying about when we will run out of money,” Unacademy co-founder and chief executive Gaurav Munjal told employees last year. “But now we must change our ways. […] Winter is here.” Byju’s, which is India’s most valuable startup, instead is in advanced discussions with bankers including Citi and Goldman Sachs to go ahead with the IPO of Aakash, according to a source familiar with the matter and presentations made by banks and viewed by TechCrunch. Byju’s has received the approval from its board of directors to go ahead with the IPO of Aakash, which it acquired for nearly $1 billion last year, and it’s gearing up to file the paper work, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private."
94,Microsoft integrates Bing into its keyboard SwiftKey app on Android and iOS,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 13, 2023","Microsoft is integrating its Bing chatbot into its smartphone keyboard app SwiftKey on Android and iOS, the company announced on Thursday. The new integration lets users chat with the bot directly from their mobile keyboard and search for things without having to switch between apps. Bing boasts three major features on SwiftKey: Chat, Tone and Search. With the Chat functionality, you can access the new Bing on the go for more detailed queries. The company explains that the functionality can be useful for a variety of things. For instance, you can use the chat functionality if you’re looking for a clever pun to respond to someone’s message, or if you want to quickly find what dessert pairs well with a specific dish when you’re planning a party with your friends on mobile. Image Credits: Microsoft Image Credits: Microsoft The Tone feature is designed to make it easier for users to communicate more effectively by using AI to customize their text to fit any situation. The feature can be useful in instances where you’re struggling to be formal in your work emails or you’re learning a new language and need help with word choice, Microsoft says. You can use the feature to make your sentences sound more professional, casual, polite or concise enough for a social media post. With the Search functionality, you can quickly search the web directly from your keyboard, which essentially removes the need for switching between apps. The company outlines that the feature can be used when you’re talking to a friend and want to look something up mid-conversation. The new features in SwiftKey are accessible in all markets where the new Bing is available. Anyone can use Search now, but accessing Tone and Chat requires users to sign into their Microsoft Account that has been approved to access the new Bing preview. Image Credits: Microsoft Image Credits: Microsoft Microsoft notes that the update is available today, and that once you have received the update, you will see the Bing icon above the keyboard. From there, you can click on the exact feature you’d like to use; Chat, Tone or Search. It’s worth noting that Microsoft had planned to shut down SwiftKey on iOS last year, but later decided not to. Microsoft is likely hoping to create some buzz and popularity around SwiftKey by integrating its new Bing into the product. The company also announced today that it’s launching greater access to Bing in group chats on Skype. Microsoft integrated Bing into Skype back in February in preview. Group chats now only need one member with access to the preview to talk to Bing. Image Credits: Microsoft Image Credits: Microsoft “This means as a group you can use the new Bing from within the Skype app just like you’d use the new Bing on desktop; you can use it to, for example, settle a debate, help plan a group trip, or find a restaurant for you all to meet at in person,” the company wrote in a blog post. “To get started, search for ‘Bing in Skype’ in your Skype contacts and add it to a group chat, just like you would any other contact. Just like on desktop, the new Bing chat responses in the Skype app which reference facts are cited with web links to sources, so you can double-check where the information is coming from.” In addition, Microsoft announced that Bing is now available via Microsoft Start, which is the company’s personalized news reading experience.

95,Venture interest in Chinese companies remains muted after slow 2022,['@alex'],"April 3, 2023","Welcome to the second quarter, friends. It’s time to take stock of just what went down in the first three months of the year, which means a deluge of venture capital data and yet another earnings cycle. I want to start our formal Q1 2023 venture lookback with China. PitchBook recently dropped some numbers relating to venture capital funding in China for 2022, and I’ve augmented it with a quick scan of Chinese Q1 data from the same source. The resulting picture is one of a country that’s seeing markedly smaller venture capital investments at a slower pace than has been the case for a few years. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Early 2023 data does little to dispel that impression. In the coming days, we’ll carve into global venture data and dig deeper into what’s happening in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. Today, let’s focus on China, which is replete with tech companies popular outside its borders, and its economy, which is still finding its footing in the wake of erstwhile-draconian COVID restrictions. To work!"
96,Drivers in Europe net big data rights win against Uber and Ola,['@riptari'],"April 5, 2023","In a major win over opaque algorithmic management in the so-called gig economy an appeals court in the Netherlands has found largely in favor of platform workers litigating against ride-hailing giants Uber and Ola — judging the platforms violated the drivers’ rights in a number of instances, including when algorithms were involved in terminating driver accounts. The court also ruled the platforms cannot rely on trade secrets exemptions to deny drivers access to their data. Although challenges remain for regional workers to use existing laws to get enough visibility into platforms’ data processing to know what information to ask for to be able to meaningfully exercise their data access rights. The appeal court rulings can be found here, here and here (in Dutch). The appeal was brought by the not-for-profit data trust Worker Info Exchange (WIE) in support of members of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) in the U.K. and a driver based in Portugal. One case against Uber’s robo-firings involved four drivers (three based in the U.K., one in Portugal); a second case against Uber over data access involved six U.K.-based drivers; while a data access case against Ola involved thee U.K.-based drivers. In the data access cases drivers were seeking information such as passenger ratings, fraud probability scores, earning profiles, as well as data on the allocation of journeys to drivers — including Uber’s batch matching and upfront pricing systems — as well as information about the existence of automated decision-making touching their work on the platforms. Several decisions taken by the ride-hailing platforms were found to meet the relevant legal test of automated decision-making — including assigning rides; calculating prices; rating drivers; calculating ‘fraud probability scores’; and deactivating drivers’ accounts in response to suspicions of fraud — meaning drivers are entitled to information on the underlying logic of these decisions. (And also to a right to meaningful human review if they object to decisions.) “The court ordered that Uber must explain how driver personal data and profiling is used in Uber’s upfront, dynamic pay and pricing system. Similarly, the court ordered Uber to transparently disclose how automated decision making and worker profiling is used to determine how work is allocated amongst a waiting workforce,” said WIE in a press release. “Ola Cabs was also ordered to disclose meaningful information about the use in automated decision making of worker earnings profiles and so called ‘fraud probability scores’ used in automated decision making for work and fares allocation. The court also ruled that internally held profiles relating drivers and associated performance related tags must be disclosed to drivers.” Commenting in a statement, James Farrar, director of WIE, added: This ruling is a huge win for gig economy workers in Britain and right across Europe. The information asymmetry & trade secrets protections relied upon by gig economy employers to exploit workers and deny them even the most basic employment rights for fundamentals like pay, work allocation and unfair dismissals must now come to an end as a result of this ruling. Uber, Ola Cabs and all other platform employers cannot continue to get away with concealing the controlling hand of an employment relationship in clandestine algorithms. Too many workers have had their working lives and mental health destroyed by false claims of fraudulent activity without any opportunity to know precisely what allegations have been made let alone answer them. Instead, to save money and avoid their responsibility as employers, platforms have built unjust automated HR decision making systems with no humans in the loop. Left unchecked, such callous systems risk becoming the norm in the future world of work. I’m grateful for the moral courage of the courts expressed in this important ruling. The companies have been given two months to provide the requested information to the drivers (with the risk of fines of daily several thousand euros apiece for non-compliance), as well as being ordered to pick up the majority of the case costs. Legal challenges against the algorithmic management practices of Uber and Ola were originally lodged on behalf of drivers in the U.K. back in 2020 — in July and September — centred on digital and data access rights enshrined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The pan-EU regulation provides individuals with rights to data held on them and information about algorithmic decision making applied to them — where it has a substantial or legal effect (such as employment/access to work). And while the U.K. is no longer an EU member it transposed the European data protection framework into national law before leaving the bloc. Which means that (for now) it retains the same suite of data rights. The appeal court decisions yesterday follow earlier judgements, in March 2021, by the Court of Amsterdam — which did not accept the robo-firing charges in those instances and largely rejected the drivers’ requests for specific data. However the court also tossed the platforms’ arguments seeking to deny the right of workers to collectively organize their data and establish a data trust as an abuse of GDPR data access rights — leaving the door open to fresh challenges. Transparency is a key lever in the fight for platform workers rights since there’s no way for workers to assess the fairness of algorithms or automated decisions being applied to them without having access to information on the processes involved. So this ruling looks significant in that it could help crack open black boxes systems used for algorithmic management of workforces in a way that has, oftentimes, shielded platforms from scrutiny over the fairness (or indeed legality) of their decisions. This is also a class of worker that still typically lacks full employment rights and protections, exacerbating the power imbalance vs data-mining platforms and supercharging the risks of worker exploitation. (Albeit, legal challenges in Europe have unpicked some bogus claims of self employment by platforms; while planned EU legislation in this area aims to tackle worker precariousness by setting minimum standards for platform work.) While the legal challenges against Uber and Ola involved a small number of drivers, and the rulings naturally reference their individual circumstances, the appeal victory could force gig platforms to change their process — not least to avoid the risk of more challenges being filed. Conditions of their licences to operate in markets like London may also create regulatory problems for them if they’re seen to be failing to prevent recurrences of data protection issues, the litigants suggest. Although it also may not yet be the end of the road for these particular cases as the companies could seek to appeal the decisions to the Dutch Supreme Court. In a statement an Uber spokesperson told us it is “carefully” studying the rulings, adding that it will take a decision on whether to file an appeal “in due course”. (Ola was also contacted for comment but at the time of writing it had not responded.) In other remarks provided to TechCrunch Uber said: We are disappointed that the court did not recognize the robust processes we have in place, including meaningful human review, when making a decision to deactivate a driver’s account due to suspected fraud. Uber maintains the position that these decisions were based on human review and not on automated decision making, which was acknowledged earlier by the previous court. These rulings only relate to a few specific drivers from the UK that were deactivated in the period between 2018 and 2020 in relation to very specific circumstances. Uber also flagged one instance in which it said the appeal court found it did have meaningful human involvement in an automated decision related to a termination. In the other cases, where the court found in favor of the litigants over robo-firings, Uber was unable to prove that the human intervention was much more than a “symbolic act” — meaning it could not demonstrate the staff involved had been able to exercise a meaningful check on the automated decision that led to drivers being fired. On this WIE said the drivers in the lawsuit faced “spurious allegations of ‘fraudulent activity’ by Uber and were dismissed without appeal”. “When the drivers requested an explanation for how Uber systems had surveilled their work and wrongly determined they had engaged in fraud, Uber stonewalled them,” it claimed, adding: “The decision to dismiss the drivers was taken remotely at an Uber office in Krakow and the drivers were denied any opportunity to be heard. The court noted that Uber had failed to make ‘clear what the qualifications and level of knowledge of the employees in question are. There was thus insufficient evidence of actual human intervention.'” Discussing the outcome of the appeal in a phone call with TechCrunch, Farrer — a former Uber driver who has also successfully sued the ride-hailing giant over the employment status of U.K. drivers — said it would be “foolish” if the platforms seek to appeal to the Supreme Court. “Not only is the ruling, very decisive but it’s very sensible,” he told us. “And it also gives them very sensible guidance, in my opinion, in how you should be managing the platform in this way.”   “What the court was coming down against Uber on was this very absolutist approach that they took to managing fairly straightforward HR problems,” he argued, describing it as “nonsense” for platforms to fire someone for alleged fraud but refuse to tell them why, preventing them from responding to the charges by claiming doing so would undermine trade secrets and platform security. “It’s nonsense. Anybody can see that. And that’s what they relied on. They relied on being able to get away with doing that. And so, okay, you may choose to — foolishly — appeal that or you may want to take a sensible line that that’s not really a sensible or sustainable position to take. But if you want to continue taking it we’ll continue beating you on it. So I think, if they’re up for it, there’s some really good learning points and signposting for them — about how platforms in the modern day ought to be going about managing people.” On the data access issue, Farrer said the outcome of the appeal shows they’re “bumping up against the limits of the law” — since the court upheld some earlier decisions to withhold data from drivers based on their asks not being specific enough. The Catch-22-style situation here is if the platforms aren’t fully up-front and transparent about the data they’re processing how can the drivers know what to ask them for with enough specificity to get given the data? So setting governance on platform transparency is an area lawmakers should be focused on. “On that point we didn’t make significant progress,” he said. “We asked for access to all personal data. And then the platforms kicked back and — denial and obfuscation — either say you need to specify [the data you want] or they’ll tell you they’re taking a ‘phased approach’, whatever that is — but without telling you that that’s what they’re doing. So they’ll give you some data and then later, if you complain, they can say, well, we were taking a phased approach. But they forgot to tell anyone. “And here what the court is saying is that if you’re not getting all the data you think you want then you have an obligation, under Article 15, to go back and say, what are the categories of data you’re processing and then hone your requests based on on that. But… that’s where we reach the limits of the law, I suppose. Because if these companies are not really very clear or transparent, or if they’re vague about the categories of data they say the processing, then you’re still in that chicken and egg problem that you don’t know what you don’t know. So that still kind of remains the same.” Per Farrer, the litigants did get one good result on this aspect via the appeal — in relation to data processing categories in an Uber guidance document, which he said the court agreed Uber should have to hand over. “So I think what the court is saying is that when you’re able to be more specific there’s very little defence [in withholding data]. So when we’re getting to the specifics around automated decision-making, or also information about automated decision-making, as well as data processing around some of these difficult decisions, then, yeah, there’s little defense in not giving it.” Gig worker rights organizations are also concerned about emergent rights risks coming down the pipe — warning, for example, about the rise of personalized pricing (aka dynamic pricing) — as platforms seek ever more complex systems for calculating and fragmenting payments to workers (and, indeed, the amounts billed to users). Dynamic pricing not only clearly boosts opacity around how the platforms’ payment/charging systems work but could create fresh opportunities for harm by scaling unfairness and discrimination on both sides of two-sided marketplaces and in ever more multi-faceted ways. (Such as, for example, female users facing higher surge prices at night based on the perception of increased vulnerability.) WIE points to a paper published in the Harvard Business Review last year that warned algorithmic pricing systems pose policy challenges which are far broader than collusive conduct — and can lead to higher prices for consumers in competitive markets (even without collusion; so outside traditional antitrust law) — with the researchers called for pricing regulation to prevent harms. And it argues pretty much the same set of harms issues arise for platform workers subject to dynamic pricing too. “It is very important for us to be able to help workers understand the basis for how and what they’re being paid but also to safeguard against personalization in pay — either directly or indirectly,” said Farrer on this. “These platforms have furiously denied personalization in pay. But sure, what’s the optimization in here then? I mean it’s going to happen directly or indirectly and we absolutely have to have an eagle eye on it, because if not, there will be abuses because the controls aren’t there. And because as these platforms seek to optimise that’s the effect it’s going to have — either directly or indirectly.” 3. Platforms such as Uber and Ola cannot rely on trade secrets exemptions, as these ""claims were entirely disproportionate relative to the negative effect of unexplained automated dismissal and disciplining of workers."" — Jill Toh (@jilltoh) April 4, 2023  What will WIE be doing with the driver information it has been to extract from platforms? “We are already starting to get data at scale — and we are working with data scientists at the moment to build the analytics we need to [build workers’ collective bargaining power],” said Farrer. “Where it’s transformative is… there’s an information power asymmetry between the worker and the platform. The workers have very weak bargaining power because of the oversubscription problem. Because of the lack of a sensible employment relationship that confers rights. Because of the difficulty in building collective union participation, although that’s changing rapidly for ADCU. “Then we need to find the means to building that collective power. Platforms trade on our personal data but it’s our personal data so we have to try and beat them at their own game — or fight them in their own game — by aggregating that data. And aggregating that data will be able to tell what are the true pay conditions. Because so many workers have to rely on the myth of what the platform is telling them, rather than what’s really happening… And that picture is actually getting more complex. Because companies like Uber and Deliveroo they’re not happy just to rely on set pay being highly variable. They actually want to take a sledgehammer to the pay structure and fragment it into more and more pieces — incentives for this, bonus for this, boost for this — so by the time you’re done you don’t know what you’re being paid or what the basis of your pay is. And that’s a very deliberate thing… And the move to dynamic pay is a big part of that.” “We are already getting enough information to be very useful. So we seem to have ironed out some of those problems in that at least what we’re getting is the trip information. So we can we can do analysis on that much at least,” he added. “But there’s still, of course, and there will always be a battle over the level of algorithmic transparency that’s required from the workers relative to what these platforms are willing to do. “And, of course, their message of algorithmic control is a moveable feast. We’ve seen that over the last couple of years — with upfront pricing and now dynamic pricing. Those are progressive changes in the development of the platform and our job is to try and understand the processing that’s going on with that — and that’s a moveable feast in that there’s always going to be a challenge because we’re going to want to know and they’re going to want to not tell us.” Uber et al.’s push-back on calls for greater transparency is — typically — to claim their anti-fraud systems won’t work if workers know enough about how they function to be able to circumvent them. They also tend to claim they’re prevented from releasing more data because they’re protecting passengers’ privacy. (It remains to be seen what multi-tiered excuses platforms will drum up to argue against providing total pay transparency.) Farrer responds to such lines by suggesting the platforms are seeking to deflect attention off their own security failings and management and regulatory deficiencies — by creating a red-herring concept of driver “fraud” in order to foist blame for their own business management failings onto rights denuded workers. “There’s no real plausible way that the driver can defraud the platform — because they don’t have access to any kind of credit card information or anything behind the scene. And I think the whole idea of account account security is a sensitive issue for Uber, and certainly their investors, because they need to maintain the confidence of passengers that if you give me your personal data and your credit card details, it’ll be secure. So I think for them they would either consciously or unconsciously prefer to blame their platform security problems on the worker, rather than admitting that they may have their own cybersecurity problems to deal with,” he suggested. “These are hollowed out companies,” he added. “They want to automate as much of the management inside the company as they do service delivery outside the company. So if they can find a way to tack something on an 80:20 [system accuracy] basis that’s good enough for them because the workers have no recourse anyway. And anyway, the whole nature of the platform is to be massively over oversubscribed. So they’re not short of drivers that they can just sling off.” “The truth of it is, is that transport business — I don’t care whether it’s road transport, air, rail — it’s a capital intensive, labour intensive, low margin business, and it always has been. But you can still make money in it. But what these platforms thought they could do is descend from the cloud, deny they’re a transport operator, insist that they’re a technology company, and cream margins away from that business that were never there to begin with. And so unless they want to acclimatize themselves to the industry that they’re in — and figure out how they can make money in a low margin business, instead of trying to take the easy way and illegal way — then, yeah, they are going to face annihilation. But maybe if they get some sensible people in to understand how to devise a strategy for the business they’re really in, not the business they want to be in, then maybe they’ve have better luck.” In the EU, lawmakers are aiming to make it harder for platforms to just sling off precarious workers — by setting down minimum standards atop a (rebuttable) presumption of employment for gig workers. Although the file has proved divisive with Member States and the Council still hasn’t adopted a negotiating position. But MEPs in the parliament agreed their position back in February. The litigants are calling for EU lawmakers to get on and pass this reform to improve protections for gig workers. And while Farrer confirms they won’t stop filing legal challenges to try to unpick exploitation he argues there’s a clear need for lawmakers to get a handle on the power imbalance and pass proper regulation to guarantee workers are protected without needing to spend years fighting through the courts. (The much touted modern working practices employment reforms, promised by former U.K. PM Theresa May in the wake of the 2017 Taylor review, ended with a damp squib package of measures that unions savaged on arrival as “big on grandiose claims, light on substance”; and which Farrer dismisses now as “nothing” having being done.) He also suggests regulators are sleeping on the job — pointing, for example, to Transport for London’s (TfL) licensing for Uber which requires any changes to its business model need to be communicated to it 30 days in advance. Yet when WIE asked TfL if it’s reviewed Uber’s switch to upfront pricing the regulator failed to respond. (We’ve reached out to TfL with questions about this and will update this report with any response. Update: The regulator ignored our questions asking for confirmation of whether or not Uber notified it of the change to its pricing model in advance; whether it has reviewed the new business model and if it has any concerns; and whether it has sought a legal review of Uber’s switch to dynamic pricing — sending us this brief statement instead: “We are aware of the judgment from the Amsterdam Court of Appeal and are considering the ruling.” ) “Workers are already in a very weak position. But if you’ve got this tacit collusion problem, well, that amounts to grey- and black-listing of the worker — and that’s illegal under employment law. So for those reasons, we really have our work cut out to to aggregate this data and keep a very close eye on this,” he said, adding: “We need a platform worker directive equivalent in the U.K.” Where workers right are concerned there’s actually more bad news zooming into view in the U.K. — where the government is in the processing of passing a data reform bill the litigants warn will strip away some of the protections workers have been able to exercise in this case. Such as a requirement to carry out a data protection impact assessment (a procedure that would typically entail platforms consulting with workers — so the reform looks set to discourage that type of engagement by platforms). The draft bill also proposes to raise the threshold for individuals to get access to their data by allowing more leeway to platforms to deny requests — which could mean workers in the U.K. have the added challenge of having to argue for the validity of their right to access their own data, even to just get a chance of a sniff of seeing any of the stuff. So, as it stands, U.K. lawmakers are intending to burden workers with even more friction atop a process that can already take years of legal action to see even a partial victory. Making life harder for platform workers to exercise their rights obviously won’t tip the already-stacked scales on gig economy exploitation. The litigants are urging parliamentarians to amend the draft reform to ensure key protections stand. (Albeit, given the U.K.’s sclerotic record in this area, it may take a change of government before there’s any meaningful action to rein in platform power and support workers rights.) In a statement, Farrer dubbed the ruling “a bittersweet victory considering that the U.K. government plans to strip workers of the very protections successfully claimed in this case”, adding: “Lawmakers must learn important lessons from this case, amend the bill and protect these vital rights before it is too late. Similarly, the Council of the European Union must not hesitate in passing the proposed Platform Work Directive as passed by the European Parliament.”      "

The exec announced his transition plans via a Twitter post noting he would be leaving Snap in May, which Snap also confirms, in order to focus on partnering with the “next generation of consumer founders.” After starting as a design engineer, Andreou served in various roles at Snap over the years, from May 2015 through July 2022, including also vice president of Product, director of Product and Growth, and director of Growth. In July 2022, he was shifted to senior vice president of Growth as part of a broader reshuffling of Snap’s executive team. In this position, Andreou was responsible for Snapchat’s monetization products, growth operations and data science. This May, after more than 8 years, I’ll be leaving @Snap. To the team and Evan, thank you for giving me the honor of a lifetime. Getting to help build such an impactful product and company has changed my life. — Jacob Andreou (@jacobandreou) March 27, 2023  As Axios reported last year, the shakeup had been designed to prioritize monetization and growth at the Snapchat maker. Among the changes, Snap also moved Jack Brody, VP of Product, to a role that would have him overseeing all of Snap’s product innovation, including teams across the Snapchat app and the hardware division, Snap Lab. In addition, the company hired ex-Googler Biswanath Panda as its VP of ads engineering and Lars Hirsch as its VP of ads product, who had spent time in ad product divisions at Microsoft, Amazon and Google. And in August, Snap appointed Jerry Hunter as COO, after he was previously SVP of Engineering. Today Snap also announced it hired a new President of Americas, Rob Wilk, who was previously Global Head of Advertising at Microsoft. Before working at Snap, Andreou co-founded and led product at analytics platform ThinkAkili from May 2012 through March 2015. In his departure announcement, the exec thanked the team and Evan [Spiegel, CEO of Snap] for the “honor of a lifetime” and for getting to “help build such an impact full product” adding the company had changed his life. A profile with Fortune noted Andreou, who is 29, had already done some angel investing while at Snap, including in startups like In Search Of and with creator app Captions.AI, which had been founded by former Snap employees. But he will now be able to focus on consumer technology, and particularly the influencer and creator market and other AI startups. Greylock has investments in a number of consumer tech companies, including Discord, Figma, Coinbase, Nextdoor, Roblox and others."
98,"Twitter won’t let you retweet, like or reply to Substack links",['@asilbwrites'],"April 7, 2023","So much for “free speech absolutism.” Twitter is censoring Substack links by making the posts impossible to reply to, like or retweet. While quote-tweeting works, simply pressing the retweet button surfaces an error message: “Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter.” The timing of this action doesn’t seem coincidental. Two days ago, Substack launched its Notes feature, which looks a whole lot like Twitter. Unlike other new Twitter alternatives, Substack has a huge advantage: people actually use the platform, and many writers already have massive followings there. Such writers include Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss, who Twitter owner Elon Musk partnered with to publish “The Twitter Files.” Under Musk’s ownership, Twitter has also taken steps to suppress content from Mastodon, an open source social network that gained a sudden influx of users when Musk took control of Twitter. In December, Twitter temporarily suspended Mastodon’s account and banned posting links to Mastodon servers. On its formerly banned Twitter account, Mastodon said, “Not a good sign if you need to build a wall to keep people in.” Not a good sign if you need to build a wall to keep people in.

The future of social media is open and decentralized.https://t.co/o9C0mekuMp — Mastodon (@Mastodon@mastodon.social) (@joinmastodon) April 7, 2023  “We’re disappointed that Twitter has chosen to restrict writers’ ability to share their work. Writers deserve the freedom to share links to Substack or anywhere else,” Substack’s founders wrote in an emailed statement. “Their livelihoods should not be tied to platforms where they don’t own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim.” Musk is an active critic of mainstream media, going as far as slapping a misleading “state-affiliated media” label on NPR’s account. These labels are usually reserved for publications that do not have editorial independence from state government, but the government has no hand in NPR’s content; plus, the news organization only received about 1% of its budget from federal funding in 2020. Substack is touted as an alternative to mainstream media, giving writers a platform to earn subscription revenue with very little editorial regulation. Similar to Musk’s own views on content moderation, Substack takes a “hands-off” approach — the newsletter site has even come under fire for choosing not to intervene when writers spread misinformation about vaccines. Anyway, you didn’t hear this from us, but if you link to a Substack via a redirected URL, it seems to post without restrictions.  "
99,"Groupon, which has lost 99.4% of its value since its IPO, names a new CEO… based in Czech Republic",['@ingridlunden'],"March 31, 2023","A dozen years ago, Groupon shot to fame popularizing the online group buying format, confidently rejecting a $6 billion acquisition offer from Google and instead going public with a $17.8 billion market cap. The company today says it has 14 million active users, but almost consistently for the last decade, its financial position has been in a slow decline — with stagnation in its core business model, little success in efforts to diversify, declining revenues and ongoing losses. And today comes the latest chapter in that story. The Chicago-based company, which today has a market cap of just $103 million (a drop of 99.4% from its public market debut), has appointed Dusan Senkypl, a current board member, as interim CEO. Senkypl will run the company… out of the Czech Republic. His appointment is effective immediately, the company said in a statement today. He replaces Kedar Deshpande, who had been Groupon’s CEO for just 15 months. Before Groupon, Deshpande was an exec at Zappos for more than a decade, and after he took the Groupon job, he continued to be based out of Las Vegas. He will stay on for 60 more days to help with the transition, the company said. Senkypl is a co-founder of Pale Fire Capital, a PE firm based in Prague (and named after the Nabokov novel?). Most of Pale Fire’s investments are in businesses out of its home country and other parts of Europe. But it is also currently Groupon’s biggest shareholder — a role it has not held passively: The two businesses were embroiled in an activist fight last year that resulted in the firm getting two board seats at the company, one of which Senkypl holds. “Since he joined the Board, Dusan has been very engaged as a director, providing important oversight on Groupon’s strategy and strengths and helping the company identify areas in need of improvement,” noted Ted Leonsis, Groupon’s chairman, in an upbeat take on the news. Indeed. In November, Pale Fire announced that it was helping Groupon rebuild its whole technology team, starting with the appointment of a new CTO from one of its other portfolio companies. The company has also been doing some other fairly intense restructuring, with its position not helped by the wider pressures on the technology sector and the economy overall: across two tranches in August 2022 and January 2023, it laid off around 1,000 employees, or roughly 30% of its workforce. Groupon specifically has faced a host of challenges over the years. The very concept of group buying is structured on the concept of hype, which may have been a fateful, less-than-promising starting point. Even early on, and despite the predictions of it being a threat to Google and Amazon, others debated whether it could rightly be considered a “tech” company. But beyond this, Groupon — despite making more than 40 acquisitions, including a host of clones across international markets, plus a number of interesting e-commerce and fintech businesses — failed to find other hooks to diversify itself. Meanwhile, a key marketing route for the company — email — died a small death when Google changed how subscription emails were categorized (and could be more easily ignored). And of course, dozens of other platforms and innovations have emerged targeting customers who are looking to buy the kind of experiences and services that companies like Groupon sell. Senkypl and Groupon have a tall order ahead of them to turn all this around. But the new CEO believes that there is still an opportunity to fix what isn’t working. “I have a deep appreciation for the dedication that has gone into building this company and am honored to guide Groupon through its transformation and turnaround,” Senkypl said in a statement. “With unique local inventory, over 14 million active local customers and millions of visitor sessions per month, Groupon has valuable assets capable of fueling significant growth when paired with operational excellence. I am excited to build on that foundation to further scale the company’s marketplace and drive increased value for all stakeholders. I have built multiple businesses from the ground up that operated at scale with hundreds of millions of users, and I believe I know what we need to do at Groupon to take the company to the next level.” For some context on those numbers: 14 million might sound like a big number, but recall that when the company first filed to go public back in 2011, it said it had more than 83 million registered subscribers, with around 15.8 million of them having purchased Groupon deals. There is a lot of work to do, in other words, to get people to care about Groupon again."
100,India’s central bank abandons UPI rival project,['@refsrc'],"April 7, 2023","India’s central bank has halted its plans for a high-profile project intended to rival the nation’s dominant payment system, Unified Payments Interface. The project had attracted significant interest from a variety of major conglomerates, tech giants and financial institutions, including Amazon, Reliance, Facebook, Tata Group, Google, HDFC and ICICI. The Reserve Bank of India had initially invited bids in 2021 for licenses to operate new retail payment and settlement systems across India. The project was called New Umbrella Entity, or NUE. However, according to RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar, the project’s potential participants failed to propose “any innovative or infrastructural solutions.” Sankar emphasized the central bank’s interest in exploring ideas that go beyond incremental improvements or substitutes for existing technologies. UPI, which now processes over 8 billion transactions a month, was inching closer to the 1 billion milestone in 2021. The central bank sought to mitigate concentration risk as UPI’s importance in the economy continued to grow, aiming to develop an alternative protocol that would alleviate strain on the existing system. Industry players had formed four consortia and were planning to make a bid for the NUE license. Image Credits: Bernstein Industry players had formed four consortia and were planning to make a bid for the NUE license. Image Credits: Bernstein PhonePe and Google Pay were commanding the most market share in UPI in 2021 — not much has changed — and many industry participants saw NUE as a way to be early and aggressive with a new payments system. In an earlier proposal, RBI sought NUEs to be interoperable with each other. “Thus, NUEs do not have any proprietary access. However, NUEs can customize the networks to their business model and distribution capabilities. If a conglomerate is strong in e-commerce, the NUE could customize to the specific needs of that use-case. UPI has market share caps/calibrated growth for new players (e.g. WhatsApp). NUEs would not have such restrictions and might help with accelerated network effects for private players. Thus, NUEs customized design and self-governance could provide stronger capabilities. Unlike UPI’s generic payment network, NUEs will have customized networks based on use-cases,” Bernstein wrote in a report in 2021."
101,Warner Bros. Discovery CTO and CPO explain how they made Max less buggy,['@laurenforristal'],"May 5, 2023","A few weeks before Warner Bros. Discovery launches its new HBO Max/Discovery+ streaming service, Max, TechCrunch spoke with WBD chief technology officer Avi Saxena and chief product officer Tyler Whitworth about building the new platform from the ground up, rolling out new features, improving functionality, adding new tech and all around designing the product. They also outlined the technical steps the company took to ensure Max subscribers have a smooth viewing experience. As you would expect, merging two streaming services together isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Overall, the company underwent 12 months of planning to build a cohesive platform that serves all types of customers. Saxena explained to us that in order to fast-track the process, engineer teams from both sides pitched in. “Bringing the teams together was really a MasterClass in engineering, organization, design and architecture,” Saxena said. “We brought on all the teams that worked on front-end technology, the team that worked on payments technology, the teams that worked on user authentication, every aspect of the product.” “The team’s had a very rigorous debate on what do we really want in our product going forward to serve the customer the best,” Saxena added.   It’s safe to say WBD has a lot to prove with Max, given its not-so-great reputation with HBO Max’s app, including multiple outages and complaints of playback issues, problems with audio and bugs. Even WBD’s CEO and president of global streaming and games, JB Perrette said HBO Max and Discovery+ had their respective “shortcomings” he admitted during the WBD press event in April. The company also said in its announcement that Max would provide a new video playback experience that provides a smooth and cinematic experience for users. “Performance is one of the most important parts of the platform,” Saxena told us. “So to improve performance, number one from the onset, we set a goal that every app needs to be at least 20% faster than the existing app.” To achieve this goal of faster performance and more stability, Saxena told us that Max uses multiple CDNs (content delivery networks) to give the app improved resiliency. CDNs are a group of servers that caches and streams content to nearby end-users while also keeping the content secure. Essentially, the networks help speed up content delivery. “So when something goes down, the product still continues to work,” he explained in layman’s terms. Max uses four CDNs — Amazon CloudFront, Google’s Cloud CDN, Akamai and Fastly. It also uses AWS as a primary cloud provider, which millions of companies rely on for storage, databases and cloud-compute. “In any given month, we deliver more than an exabyte worth of content, which is 1,000 petabytes a month, which is a big amount. And you cannot rely on just one CDN to do that,” Saxena added. (For reference, an exabyte is a large unit of digital storage.) Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery “As we started to build Max, obviously we had the benefit of learning a lot from HBO Max and even from Discovery+, and we really focused on three things that we had learned,” Whitworth said. “One, doing the basics better. You know, the things that really matter to customers, how the product works… Second, we knew that we really wanted to make it easy for customers to find and watch the content that they love. Third was how do we make it easier to use.” In addition to performance, the major improvements that WBD focused on were: For starters, Max will have individual user profiles that are designed to offer more personalized recommendations based on their viewing habits. Users will also get new personalized pages for series, movies, brands, collections, genres and search pages. The recommendations are driven by both human curation and machine learning. “While we want to provide personalized choices to our customers, we also want to retain the option to promote some of the content that we feel very proud of,” Saxena said. “So we picked the hybrid approach, where most of the page is generated using machine learning. And then our editors have the option to override.” The majority of HBO Max already features human-curated recommendations, however, Max will be more personalized, the company claims, so that the human curation will be enhanced and provide content that is more relevant for each user. “We’re excited about taking that human and algorithm combination throughout the whole product, whereas previously we were a little more selective and limited where that was done,” Whitworth added. Another priority was making the content easier to find. Max will have a new content navigation menu at the top of the screen, genre hubs and dedicated content pages for the top WBD-owned brands — HBO, Discovery Channel, Food Network, HGTV and more. Plus, there is a new shortcut for users to add a title to their favorites list. Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Max is also giving parents the option to set new profile options for their child, such as little kids, big kids, big kids plus, pre-teens or teens. “We created these categories that make it a little more intuitive. Because not everybody knows what TV-PG means… [We] want to make it easier for people to quickly understand it and see how it works,” Whitworth explained. “I happen to have three kids myself, and you know, sometimes using these kids’ features in streaming products isn’t isn’t as easy as it could be.” Netflix is one streamer that allows users to set different maturity settings — Kids, TV-PG and PG. Another rival streaming service, Disney+, caters its kids experiences to younger kids. So, Max will likely target slightly older children who want to watch titles like “The LEGO Batman Movie,” “Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai,” “Scooby-Doo” and more. Max users are also getting new alerts that notify them about failed payments. Plus, PayPal is now a payment option. The streaming service will give users a new sign-in process, so they’ll no longer need to type in their credentials with their TV remote. A notable — yet pricey — addition to the updated platform is the new tier, “Max Ultimate Ad-Free” ($19.99/month), which gives users access to more 4K UHD content, 100 offline downloads, Dolby Atmos sound quality and the ability to stream on four devices at one time. Whitworth said that launching the ultimate plan gives the company an opportunity to provide better video quality and more downloads to customers. “We thought giving customers more choices was generally a better direction to go. And we’re excited to see how customers use it going forward,” Whitworth said. It’s important to note that HBO Max subscribers previously had access to 4K content yet were only paying $15.99 per month. Now they’ll have to cough up more cash if they want to watch high-quality streams of their favorite titles like “The Last of Us,” “Lord of the Rings,” “Game of Thrones” and “The Dark Knight” trilogy, among others.   Notably, Whitworth also said the engineering team built a “really great” live platform that can “deliver any kind of live content,” he claimed. In the past, HBO Max has livestreamed UEFA Champions League matches in Brazil and Mexico. In January of this year, the streamer began broadcasting domestic live sporting events, giving subscribers access to live U.S. national soccer games. The company has yet to announce which live sporting events are launching on Max. “I think we’re excited about what live could become in Max. We’re still working through kind of what that’s going to look like, when that can happen, what will be included or not,” Whitworth added.   Regarding the overall design, Whitworth said the company intentionally didn’t want Max to look drastically different from its predecessor HBO Max. “We wanted to make the transition pretty smooth for our HBO Max customers. So we really viewed the product as more of an evolution of HBO Max than a revolution of it,” Whitworth said. “You’ll see that it has a lot of the look and feel and some similarities to HBO Max, so it wouldn’t be a huge transition for those that use HBO Max all the time.” When asked about future plans, Whitworth declined to go into detail. However, he noted that the company is exploring “better opportunities to find content when you’re actually in the video player itself.” “There’s a long list that we’re really excited about, and ultimately it’ll be based on what customers like and how they use our product and we will evolve in a way that works best for our customers,” he said. While Max will essentially look like a revamped HBO Max — aside from the new blue color and slightly different name — it will also contain a majority of content from Discovery+. The company is also set to launch new content on the service, including a “Harry Potter” TV series and “Game of Thrones” spin-off. The streamer is set to launch in the U.S. on May 23. Updated 5/5/23 at 2:05 p.m. ET. removed the inaccurate statement that says it is a first for the company to have recommendations across every platform/devices. We’d also corrected the statement that said “only parts of HBO Max are human-curated.” The majority of the streaming service features human curation.   "
102,"Tesla cuts prices for Model 3, Model Y on eve of Q1 earnings",['@rebeccabellan'],"April 19, 2023","Tesla has cut the price of its Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles for the second time this month. Now, Tesla’s most popular models will start under $40,000 before incentives. The price slash comes on the eve of Tesla’s first-quarter earnings report, when investors will be watching out for the automaker’s margins after a series of price cuts this quarter. This year alone, Tesla has issued discounts for the Model 3 and Model Y in the U.S. in January and February, and for the Model S and Model X in March in an attempt to lure buyers as competition increases and the economy weakens. Over the past two quarters, the automaker has also slashed prices for its EVs in Mexico, Europe and China, where it has sparked a price war among competitors. The discounts did indeed boost Tesla’s quarterly sales, with the automaker delivering a record 422,875 EVs in Q1. But analysts say the increase in sales might come at the cost of healthy margins, which are expected to hit a more than three-year low as a result. According to Visible Alpha, Tesla is expected to report auto gross margin of 23.2%, down from 32.9% last year. Prices in the U.S. for the Model Y AWD, Long Range and Performance vehicles have been cut by $3,000 each. The Model Y AWD went from $49,990 to $46,990; the Long Range from $52,990 to $49,990; and Performance from $56,990 to $53,990. The cost of the Model 3 Standard Range RWD went from $41,990 to $39,990. The Model 3 is the only model of Tesla’s to have its federal tax credit reduced from $7,500 to $3,750 on Tuesday following the U.S. Treasury’s updated battery sourcing guidance for the EV tax credit. The price of the Model 3 Performance doesn’t appear to have changed yet. A previous version of this article stated Tesla had not offered a vehicle for less than $40,000. In 2019, Tesla briefly offered the Model 3 for $35,000."
103,There was just one fintech unicorn minted in the first quarter,"['Christine Hall', 'Mary Ann Azevedo']","April 18, 2023","Global fintech funding totaled $15 billion in the first quarter of this year, growing 55% from the fourth quarter, according to CB Insights’ latest State of Fintech report.  While this generally may seem like a win, it’s important to note a few things. First, 2020 and 2021 were unique years where investment in fintech broke records. By comparison, fintech funding amounted to $75.2 billion in all of 2022, down 46% compared with a staggering $131.5 billion raised in 2021. From the numbers for the first quarter, it’s clear that the market is working on a correction.  Second, of the $15 billion raised during the first quarter of this year, $6.5 billion of that was all Stripe. Without that raise, CB Insights said funding would have amounted to $8.5 billion, or a 12% drop in funding from the fourth quarter of 2022. And third, if we remove Stripe’s round and stick with the $8.5 billion, when comparing this quarter to first quarters of previous years, funding is the lowest it has been since 2019. Meanwhile, the number of deals is also down. There were 983 deals made in the first quarter, a decrease from 1,007 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 1,629 in the first quarter of 2022. A bright spot in the market was “megarounds,” which are deals valued at $100 million or more. These deals accounted for 61% of total funding in the first quarter, a whopping 179% increase quarter over quarter across 16 deals and a total of $9.2 billion, CB Insights reported. Following Stripe’s deal was Rippling, which raised $500 million in mid-March as Silicon Valley Bank was melting down. Notably, deal count was down, dropping 24% quarter over quarter. Early-stage funding continued to dominate in fintech, however; for the first quarter, it hit a new high, accounting for 72% of deal share in the three-month period, CB Insights reported. Since 2019, that number has been around 65% and rising to 69% in the first quarter of 2022.  Though the United States led across all stages during the quarter, it’s worth noting that six of the top 10 fintech seed and angel rounds were invested outside of the U.S. United Kingdom–based Carbonplace, a carbon credit settlement startup, raised a whopping $45 million seed round during the quarter. Speaking of the U.S., the region grabbed $10.5 billion in overall funding for the first quarter, which is triple the amount of funding from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was $3.5 billion, and coincidentally a five-year low. The number of deals also rebounded from the fourth quarter, up 23% to 434.  CB Insights notes that excluding Stripe’s round (recall it was $6.5 billion), funding in the U.S. was $4 billion and would have still eclipsed the fourth quarter. Drilling down into deal stage, early-stage deal share in the U.S. increased to 68%, which is a five-year high, according to CB Insights. Meanwhile, following a steady decrease in funding dollars going into the payments sector, Stripe’s megaround helped turn this around to the tune of a 200% jump to $8.1 billion in the first quarter compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Looking quarter to quarter, it is slightly down from the first quarter of 2022’s $8.3 billion. Meanwhile, the number of deals continued its decline, falling to 161, down from 195 in the fourth quarter. That marked the ninth straight decrease in deal volume, according to CB Insights. The increase in investment dollars was seen most prominently in early-stage deals, which accounted for 74% of the overall deals and a five-year high, up from 66% in 2022.

104,Satellite bus startup Apex Space plans first launch aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-10,['@breadfrom'],"April 4, 2023","Los Angeles-based startup Apex Space will launch its first satellite bus next January, part of its bet that spacecraft mass manufacturing will enable humanity’s greater expansion into the cosmos. The company will launch its Aries spacecraft, which will be equipped with multiple customer payloads, on board SpaceX’s Transporter-10 rideshare mission. Aries, the first in a line of planned satellite buses, will be capable of a maximum 200 kilograms of wet mass and a 100 kilogram payload capacity to low Earth orbit. To Apex co-founder Ian Cinnamon’s knowledge, this first mission will mark the fastest time a company has ever moved from clean sheet to launch for this size class of satellite, he told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Moving fast is the point. Apex, which came out of stealth last fall with $7.5 million in seed funding, was founded by Cinnamon and Maximilian Benassi after the pair observed a bottleneck in the space industry related to satellite bus manufacturing. Industry standard has been both costly and time-consuming: custom-building buses for each customer. Apex was founded on the hunch that the space industry is demanding something different — and that it doesn’t all boil down to price. Apex Space co-founders Maximilian Benassi and Ian Cinnamon. Image Credits: Apex Space Apex Space co-founders Maximilian Benassi and Ian Cinnamon. Image Credits: Apex Space “The biggest thing that we’re noticing is, the largest driver for all the customers that we talk to is speed,” Cinnamon said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “When we first entered this, we thought the biggest differentiator would be reliant on price. […] The number of people that approach us and say, ‘Hey, I need your help, I need to buy a spacecraft that would get me in orbit in six months, nine months, 12 months, really to us proves out that the bottleneck is really the pace of getting the satellite buses manufactured. We specialize in, how can we be the fastest producer.” Apex’s plan is to move along a growth curve that looks nearly exponential on paper. Next year, the company aims to manufacture five Aries satellites; by 2025, 20 satellites; and by 2026, 100 satellites. The company is currently building the spacecraft from its Los Angles headquarters, though Cinnamon said the plan is to eventually break ground on a factory capable of manufacturing up to one satellite per week. There will be multiple paying customers on this first mission, though Cinnamon declined to name them. Unlike future missions, Apex will be flying the satellite bus themselves, rather than selling it outright to customers. “We want a little bit more control over what happens in space and because of that we effectively are our own primary customer, and we have additional commercial paying customers who are putting their payloads on our spacecraft as well,” Cinnamon explained. Apex eventually plans to offer multiple satellite bus models, including a 250 kilogram payload capacity bus called Nova and a 500 kilogram payload capacity bus named Comet. But starting with Aries, rather than an ultra-large satellite bus, is the result of an “industry trend” that the company has noticed, Cinnamon said. That trend is related to the proliferation of satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, which are composed of many dozen or hundred (or more) smaller satellites, as opposed to fewer very big satellites. While other companies may be designing larger satellite buses, with bets that SpaceX’s Starship and other planned heavy-lift rockets will come online sooner rather than later, Cinnamon said Apex is planning for today’s market needs. “We want to be building for today’s market, as well as be well-positioned as the market grows and changes to be able to go where the puck is going,” he said. “But we don’t want to wait for the puck.”"
105,Infogrid raises $90M for its AI-driven building monitoring tech,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 11, 2023","Infogrid, a startup that uses AI to collect and analyze data on things like air quality, occupancy and energy consumption, today announced that it raised $90 million in a Series B round led by Northzone. William Cowell de Gruchy, Infogrid’s CEO, says that the cash will be put toward product development, strategic hires and customer acquisition efforts. “Now was the time to raise the capital and use it to drive our expansion,” De Gruchy said. “We are coming off of 5x growth last year and the market is strongly calling for our solutions … We opted for equity because alongside capital, we want strategic partners to help us scale to the next level and we have both VCs and clients and partners investing. This brings value far greater than even the cash.” De Gruchy — who has a fascinating history, having studied cage fighting and served as an army officer before pivoting to a quieter, white-collar career in due diligence analysis — founded Infogrid in 2018. While working for strategic advisory firm Drystone Strategy, De Gruchy routinely visited companies that he was “diligencing” for private equity deals, including dairies, roofing companies and distribution warehouses. While on these “diligencing” visits, De Gruchy spotted what he describes as a lack of real-time digital data and visibility into “operational inefficiencies,” as well as health risks and environmental concerns surrounding buildings and facilities. “When I asked why people weren’t using current-day technologies — e.g. cloud computing, cellular connectivity and sensors — to solve this issue, they repeatedly answered in the same way; it was too complex and too expensive,” De Gruchy told TechCrunch in an email interview. “I set out to answer that problem and defeat the incumbent solution — the clipboard — and that’s the seed that became Infogrid today.” Infogrid’s platform, powered by AI, gathers and analyzes data from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to help property managers and owners optimize the performance of their various buildings — at least in theory. Via IoT sensors manufactured by an ecosystem of hardware partners, Infogrid can measure domains such as the number of people, air quality and cleaning needs throughout a building, for example, as well as track energy usage and CO2 levels in relation to the number of people in a building, so that customers can make adjustments impacting sustainability scores and operating costs. Image Credits: Infogrid Image Credits: Infogrid As De Gruchy explains, the types of customers adopting Infogrid are usually looking to solve facilities management issues like avoiding unnecessary cleaning, preventing pointless tap flushing for legionella compliance or environmental, social and governance reporting. “We collect nearly 4 billion data points per month, up from 500 million a year ago, and growing exponentially,” De Gruchy said. “This trains our AI, which is then refined with user feedback, making it better.” Infogrid competes with a number of companies in the buildings management space, including BrainBox and Sidewalklabs’ Mesa, whose algorithms make fine-grained adjustments to climate control and monitoring systems on the fly. Meanwhile, Facilio and Buildings IOT, two other rivals, install and configure building control systems and bring the data from those systems together within a unified management interface. The growing number of competitors coincides with an uptick in VC investments in IoT companies. IoT companies raising funds in 2022 pulled in $15.9 million on average, up 30% from the previous year, as Crunchbase data reveals. De Gruchy credits several factors with Infogrid’s success. First, he notes that an increasing number of regulations — like London banning home and office rentals below a certain energy threshold — are forcing companies to consider investing in a monitoring platform. Second, he argues that Infogrid is differentiated from other IoT-based building management systems in that it offers more context, specifically occupancy and air quality data. “There is a major transformation underway in real estate as people reduce their footprint and are forced to take sustainability seriously,” De Gruchy said. “Both are tailwinds for Infogrid as companies that seek less, but greener, real estate flock to greener, more tech-enabled buildings. Infogrid helps our clients to provide exactly this, which improves their rental yields and asset values.” When asked about the size of Infogrid’s customer base, De Gruchy wouldn’t give a figure, save claiming that the startup services “some of the largest commercial real estate services companies in the world.” He also wouldn’t give a ballpark with respect to revenue, and — in a potential cause for concern — wouldn’t commit to growing Infogrid’s 250-person headcount this year. But he repeatedly assured TechCrunch that business is healthy. “The pandemic was a strong tailwind; it drove much greater interest in remote monitoring at the time, and has driven many of the macro environmental, social and governance and real estate consolidation trends,” De Gruchy added. “This is a venn diagram ranging between point solutions for things like energy or air quality, older building management system players, software-only dashboards that scrape data from existing networks, or in-house solutions. None of these deliver everything Infogrid does, so they are only competitive in small sub areas, and many times would-be competitors are partners as we’re stronger selling a holistic solution together.”"
106,Europe spins up AI research hub to apply accountability rules on Big Tech,['@riptari'],"April 18, 2023","As the European Union gears up to enforce a major reboot of its digital rulebook in a matter of months, a new dedicated research unit is being spun up to support oversight of large platforms under the bloc’s flagship Digital Services Act (DSA). The European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT), which was officially inaugurated in Seville, Spain, today (April 18), is expected to play a major role in interrogating the algorithms of mainstream digital services — such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. ECAT is embedded within the EU’s existing Joint Research Centre (JRC), a long-established science facility that conducts research in support of a broad range of EU policymaking, from climate change and crisis management to taxation and health sciences. But while the ECAT is embedded within the JRC — and temporarily housed in the same austere-looking building (Seville’s World Trade Centre), ahead of getting more open-plan bespoke digs in the coming years — it has a dedicated focus on the DSA, supporting lawmakers to gather evidence to build cases so they can act on any platforms that don’t take their obligations seriously. Commission officials describe the function of ECAT being to identify “smoking guns” to drive enforcement of the DSA — say, for example, an AI-based recommender system that can be shown is serving discriminatory content despite the platform in question claiming to have taken steps to de-bias output — with the unit’s researchers being tasked with coming up with hard evidence to help the Commission build cases for breaches of the new digital rulebook. The bloc is at the forefront of addressing the asymmetrical power of platforms globally, having prioritized a major retooling of its approach to regulating digital services and platforms at the start of the current Commission mandate back in 2019 — leading to the DSA and its sister regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), being adopted last year. Both regulations will come into force in the coming months, although the full sweep of provisions in the DSA won’t start being enforced until early 2024. But a subset of so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) and very large online search engines (VLOSE) face imminent oversight — and expand the usual EU acronym soup. Today, the Commission said it will “very soon” designate which platforms will be subject to the special oversight regime — which requires that VLOPS/VLOSE proactively assess systemic risks their algorithms may pose, apply mitigations and submit to having stuff they say they’ve done to address such risks scrutinized by EU regulators. It’s not yet confirmed exactly which platforms will get the designation but set criteria in the DSA — such as having 45 million+ regional users — encourages educated guesses: The usual (U.S.-based) GAFAM giants are almost certain to meet the threshold, along with (probably) a smattering of larger European platforms. Plus, given its erratic new owner, Twitter may have painted a DSA-shaped target on its feathered back. But we should find out for sure in the coming weeks. Once designated as VLOPs (or VLOSE), tech giants will have four months to comply with the obligations, including producing their first risk assessment reports. This suggests formal oversight may start to kick off around fall. (Of course, building cases will take time, so we may not see any real enforcement fireworks until next year.) Risks the DSA stipulates platforms must consider include the distribution of disinformation and illegal content, along with negative impacts on freedom of expression and users’ fundamental rights (which means considering issues like privacy and child safety). The regulation also puts some limits on profiling-driven content feeds and the use of personal data for targeted advertising. And EU lawmakers are already claiming credit for certain iterations in the usual platform trajectories — such as the recent open sourcing of the Twitter algorithm. The bloc’s overarching goal for the DSA is to set new standards in online safety by using mandatory transparency as a flywheel for driving algorithmic accountability. The idea is that by forcing tech giants to open up about the workings of their AI “Black Boxes,” they’ll have no choice but to take a more proactive approach to addressing data-driven harms than they typically have. Much of Big Tech has gained a reputation for profiting off of toxicity and/or irresponsibility — whether it’s fencing fake products or conspiracy theories or amplifying outrage-fueled content and deploying hyper-engagement dark patterns that can drive vulnerable individuals into very dark places (and plenty more besides). And many mainstream marketplaces and social media giants have long been accused of failing to meaningfully address myriad harms attached to how they operate their powerful sociotechnical platforms. Instead, when another scandal strikes, they often lavish resources on crisis PR or reach for other cynical tactics designed to keep shielding their ops, deflecting blame and delaying or avoid real change. But that road looks to be running out in Europe. At the least, the DSA should help end the era of platforms’ PR-embellished self-regulation — aka, all those boilerplate statements where tech giants claim to really care about privacy/security/safety, and so on, while doing anything but. Because they will have to show their workings at arriving at such statements. (A core piece of ECAT’s work will be coming up with ways to test claims made by tech giants in the risk assessment reports they’re required to submit to the Commission at least annually.) Zooming out, the unit is being positioned as the jewel in the crown of the Commission’s DSA toolbox — a crack team of dedicated and motivated experts who are steeped in European values and will be bringing scientific rigor, expertise, and human feeling and experience to the complex task of understanding AI effects and auditing immediate impacts. The EU also hopes ECAT will be become a hub for world-leading research in the area of algorithmic auditing — and that by supporting regulated algorithmic transparency on tech giants, regional researchers will be able to unpick longer term societal impacts of mainstream AIs. If all goes to plan, the Commission is anticipating basking in the geopolitical glory of having written the rulebook that tamed Big Tech. Yet there’s no doubt the gambit is bold, the mission complex, and poor results across multiple measures and dimensions will make the bloc a lightning rod for a fresh wave of “anti-innovation” criticism. Brussels is of course anticipating that particular attack — hence its framing talks about working to shape “a digital decade that is marked by strong human centric regulation, combined with strong innovation,” as Renate Nikolay, the deputy DG for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, emphatically put it as she cut ECAT’s virtual ribbon today. At the same time, there’s no doubt algorithmic transparency is a timely mission to be taking on — with heavy hype swirling around developments in generative AI that’s spiking wide-ranging concerns over possible impacts of such fast-scaling tech. OpenAI’s ChatGPT got a passing mention at the ECAT launch event — dubbed as “one more reason” to set up ECAT, by Mikel Landabaso, a director at the JRC. “The issue here is we need to open the lid of the Black Box of algorithms that are so influential in our lives,” he said. “For the citizen. For the safe online space. For an artificial intelligence which is human centred and ethical. For the European way to [do] artificial intelligence. For something that is autonomous — which is leading the world in terms of non-standard research technology in this field, which is such a good opportunity for all of us and our scene.” The EU’s Nikolay also hyped the importance of the mission — saying the DSA is about bringing “accountability in the platform economy [and] transparency in the business models of platforms,” which is something she argued will protect “users and citizens as they navigate the online environment.” “It increases their trust in it and their choice,” she suggested, before going on to hint at a modicum of stage fright in Brussels — seasoning the main dish lawmakers will be hoping to dine out on here (i.e., increased global influence). “I can tell you the world is watching… International organisations, many partners in the world are looking at reference points when they are designing their approach to the digital economy. And why not take inspiration from the European model?” Nikolay also took a moment in her speech to address the doubters. “I want to give a strong signal of reassurance,” she said, anticipating the criticism that the EU is simply not ready to be Big Tech’s algorithmic watchdog by stressing there will actually be a pack of hounds on the case: “The Commission is getting ready for this role…We have prepared for it. We’re doing it together. And this is also where the [ECAT] comes in. Because we’re not doing it alone — we’re doing it together with important partners.” “We have shown in the EU once more that we are rule makers, not rule takers,” she also told journalists ahead of the official inauguration. “That we are ready and willing — showing the lead in how we see accountability in the online environment; how we see accountability in platforms; and how we are prepared in Brussels to put order into the Wild West of the Internet.” Speaking during a background technical briefing, ECAT staff also pointed back to work done already by the JRC — looking at “trustworthy algorithmic systems” — which they suggested they’d be building on, as well as also drawing on the expertise of colleagues in the wider research facility. They described their role as conducting applied research into AI but with a “unique” focus tied to policy enforcement. (Or: “The main difference is…this is a research team on artificial intelligence that has a regulatory force. This is the first time you have specialist researchers with this very specialist focus on a regulated legal service to understanding algorithmic systems. And this is unique. This gives us lots of powers.”) In terms of size, the plan is for a team of 30 to 40 to staff the unit — perhaps reaching full capacity by the end of the year — with some 14 hires made so far, the majority of whom are scientific staff. The initial recruitment drive attracted significant interest, with over 500 applications following their job ads last year, according to ECAT staff. Funding for the unit is coming from the existing budget of the JRC, per Commission officials, although a 1% supervisory fee on VLOPs/VLOSE will be used to finance the ECAT’s staff costs as that mechanism spins up. At today’s launch event, ECAT staff gave a series of brief presentations of four projects they’re already undertaking — including examining racial bias in search results; investigating how to design voice assistant technology for children to be sensitive to the vulnerability of minors; and researching social media recommender systems by creating a series of test profiles to explore how different likes influence the character of the recommended content. Other early areas of research include facial expression recognition algorithms and algorithmic ranking and pricing. During the technical briefing for press, ECAT staff also noted they’ve built a data analysis tool to help the Commission with the looming task of parsing the risk assessment reports that designated platforms will be required to submit for scrutiny — anticipating what’s become a common tactic for tech giants receiving regulatory requests to respond with reams of (mostly) irrelevant information in a cynical bid to flood the channel with noise. And, as noted above, as well as having a near term focus on supporting the Commission’s policy enforcement ECAT will aim to shine a light on societal impact by studying longer term effects of interactions with algorithmic technologies — also with a focus on priorities set out in the DSA, which includes areas like gender-based violence, child safety and mental health. Given the complexity of studying algorithms and platforms in the real world, where all sorts of sociotechnical impacts and effects are possible, the Center is taking a multidisciplinary approach to hiring talent — bringing in not only computer and data scientists but also social and cognitive scientists and other types of researchers. Staff emphasized they want to be able to apply a broad variety of expertise and perspectives to interrogating AI impacts. They also stressed they won’t be a walled garden within the JRC either — with plans to ensure their research is made accessible to the public and to partner with the wider European research community. (The future home for ECAT, pictured below behind JRC director Stephen Quest, has been designed as a bit of a visual metaphor for the spirit of openness they’re aiming to channel.) Image Credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch Image Credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch The aim is for ECAT to catalyze the wider academic community in Europe to zero in on AI impacts, with staff saying they will be working to build bridges between research institutions, civil society groups and others to try to establish a wide and deep regional ecosystem dedicated to unpicking algorithmic effects. One early partnership is with France’s PEReN — a research organization set up to support national policymaking and regulatory enforcement. (In another example discussed at the launch, PEReN said it had devised a tool to study how quickly the TikTok algorithm latches on to a new target when a user’s interests change — which they achieved by creating a profile that was used to mostly watch cat videos but which switched to looking at videos of trucks and then mapping how the algorithm responded.) While enforcement of EU rules can sometimes appear even more painstaking slow than the bloc’s legislative process itself, the DSA takes a new tack, thanks to the component of centralized oversight of larger platforms combined with a regime of meaty penalties that can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover for tech giants that don’t take transparency and accountability requirements seriously. The regulation also puts legal obligation on platforms to cooperate with regulatory agencies — including requirements to provide data to support Commission investigations or even deliver up staff for interview by the technical experts staffing ECAT. It’s true the EU’s data protection regime, the GDPR, also has large penalties on paper (up to 4% of global turnover); and does empower regulators to ask for information. However, its application against Big Tech has been stymied by forum shopping — which simply won’t be possible for VLOPS/VLOSE (albeit we should probably expect them to further expand their Brussels lobbying budgets). But the hope, at least, is that this centralized enforcement structure will sum to more robust and reliable enforcement. And, as a consequence, act as an irresistible force to compel platforms to put genuine focus on common goods. At the same time, there will inexorably be ongoing debate about how best to measure AI impacts on subjective considerations like well-being or mental health impacts. As well as what to prioritize (which platforms? which technologies? which harms?) — so, really, how to slice and dice limited research time given there’s such a vast, multifaceted potential surface area you could cover. Questions about how prepared the Commission is for dealing with Big Tech’s army of friction-generating policy staffers started early and seem unlikely to just disappear. Much will depend on how it sets the tone on enforcement. So whether it comes out swinging early — or allows Big Tech to set the timeline, shape the narrative around any interventions and engage in other bad faith tactics like demand never-ending dialogues about how they see “such and such” an issue. The Commission had to face questions from assembled press members at the technical briefing on its preparedness — and whether such a relatively small number of researchers can really make a dent in cracking open Big Tech’s algorithmic black boxes. It responded by professing confidence in its abilities to get on with the business of regulating. Officials also gave off a confident vibe that the DSA is the enabling framework that can pull this massive, public service-focused reverse engineering mission off. “If you look at the Digital Services Act, it has very clear transparency obligations already for the platforms. So they need to be more concerned about the algorithmic systems, the recommender systems and we will of course hold them accountable to that,” said one official, batting the concern away. A more realistic-sounding prediction of the quasi-Sisyphean task ahead of the EU came via Rumman Chowdhury, who was speaking at today’s launch event. “There’ll be a lot of controversy and discussion,” she predicted. “And my main feedback to people who have been pushing back has been, yes, it will be a very messy 3-5 years but it will be a very beneficial 3-5 years. At the end of it, we will actually have accomplished something that, to date, we have not been able to quite yet — enabling individuals outside companies who have the interest of humanity in their minds and in their hearts to actually implement these laws in platforms at scale.” Until recently, Chowdhury headed up Twitter’s AI ethics team — before new owner, Elon Musk, came in and liquidated the entire unit. She has since established a consultancy firm focused on algorithmic auditing and she revealed she’s been co-opted into the DSA effort too, saying she’s been working with the EU on research and implementation for the regulation by sharing her take on how to devise algorithmic assessment methodology. “I celebrate and applaud the event of the Digital Services Act and the work I am doing with the DSA in order to, again, move these concepts of benefit to humanity and society, from research and application into tangible requirements. And that I think is the most powerful aspect of what the Digital Services Act is going to accomplish, and also what the ECAT will help accomplish,” she said. “This is what we should be focused on,” she further emphasized, dubbing the EU’s gambit “quite unprecedented.” “What the DSA introduces — and what folks like myself can hopefully help with — is how does a company work on the inside? How is data checked? Stored? Measured? Assessed? How are models being built? And we’re asking questions that, actually, individuals outside the companies have not been able to ask until now,” she suggested. In her public remarks, Chowdhury also hit out at the latest AI hype cycle that’s being driven by generative AI tools like ChatGPT — warning that the same bogus claims are being unboxed for human-programmed technologies with a known set of flaws, such as embedded bias — while platforms are simultaneously dismantling their internal ethics teams. The pairing is no accident, she implied, but rather this is cynical opportunism at work as tech giants attempt to reboot the same old profiteering cycle and keep ducking responsibility. “Over the past years I’ve watched the slow demise of internal accountability teams at most technology companies.  Most famously my own team at Twitter. But also Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gebru’s team at Google. The last few weeks at Twitch, as well as Microsoft. At the same time, hand in hand, we are seeing the launch and imposition, frankly, the societal imposition of generative AI algorithms and solutions. So simultaneously firing the team who were the conscience of most of these companies while also building technology that, at scale, has unprecedented impacts.” While the shuttering of AI ethics teams by major platforms hardly augurs well for them turning over a fresh leaf when it comes to algorithmic accountability, Chowdhury’s presence at the EU event implied one tangible upside: Insider talent is being freed up — and, dare we say it, motivated — to take jobs working in the interest of the public good, rather than being siloed (and contained) within commercial walled gardens. “Most of the talented individuals who have qualitative or quantitative skills, technical skills, get snatched up by companies. The brain drain has been very real. My hope is that these kinds of laws and these kinds of methodologies can actually appeal to the conscience of so many people who want to be doing this kind of work, folks like myself, who had no other way back then to go work at companies,” she suggested. “And here’s where I see there’s a gap that can be filled — that needs to be filled quite badly.”"
107,P97 fills up its tank with $40M to fuel its gas station mobile commerce services,['@ingridlunden'],"March 30, 2023","The rising prices for gas continue to be a headache and stress for a lot of people around the world, but it underscores something more besides the cost of living becoming increasingly untenable: Cars are a central part of modern life. So for the entrepreneurially minded, gas stations thus represent a huge opportunity: the engagement around buying fuel is some of the most recurring and predictable activity people will have in their consumer lives. Today, a startup that has built a business out of capitalizing on that idea is announcing a round of funding to continue its growth. P97, a Houston startup that partners with fuel brands, gas station retailers, electric car charging companies, mobile wallet providers and connected car OS makers to make it easier to select and pay for your gas (or electric charge) either through an app or connected car, has picked up $40 million in equity funding. Portage, a firm known for making fintech investments, is leading the round, with other investors undisclosed. P97 has been around for 12 years and had only raised about $40 million in equity in that time, with other backers including Accenture’s venture arm, strategic backer FleetCor and industrial specialist investor Emerald. It’s not disclosing specific valuation, but Donald Frieden, the CEO and founder, said that this Series C more than doubles the valuation from its Series B. That $20 million Series B was in 2019, and PitchBook notes that P97 had a post-money valuation at that point of $95 million, which (if correct) makes the company now valued at more than $200 million. P97 may not be a household name for most. Part of that is because, as Frieden admits, it grew very slowly in its earlier days. But it’s also because a lot of the work it does is behind the scenes. It has integrations in place with several of the major gasoline brands, including Chevron, Exxon Mobile and Shell, covering some 53% of the market and 60,000 gas stations in North America, as well as Amazon (“Alexa, buy gas” in a car equipped with its automotive interface), PayPal, Walmart and others to streamline the buying of gas through those various brands’ apps. The technology covers not just payments, but an integration into the full stack underpinning the operation of the fuel or electricity pumps: after you pre-pay on your app, P97’s tech corresponds with the station’s system to unlock the pump to procure the fuel, and then it tallies up your total and charges your chosen payment method. Although it sounds like it would make the most sense as a seamless and convenient experience for consumers, there are no plans for P97 to build its own-brand “super app” that could be used at any place powered by P97: that would compete too directly with its customers, Frieden said. P97’s use case relies on a couple of factors. One is that people are growing more and more accustomed to paying for things with their phones, and not using physical cards or cash at all, with mobile payments typically processing more quickly. The approvals for payments on apps are less than six seconds, Frieden notes, “one quarter of the time at the pump.” Paying when authorizing your card on the pump-based machine on average takes 23 seconds. (And going to see the attendant takes even longer.) It’s not just that the physical card systems are time-consuming; they have long been the subject of a lot of fraudulent activity in the form of card skimming, which in 2022 was still growing strong, despite stronger security measures put in place. Between that and people more risk-averse about infections post-COVID, and you can see why mobile app-based payments at gas stations might appeal. The startup’s product expansion into marketing and selling a wider range of products and services, meanwhile, speaks to a big pain point in the world of fuel retail: Despite those high prices per-gallon, gas stations are often making small margins because competition is tight. “Gas is a commoditized product,” Portage partner Dan Ballen explained. “Your direct competitor is usually just across the street.” In other words, anything that can lead to generating more revenues per customer will be interesting to those stations, and so that is where selling and paying for a wider range of products and other offers comes into play, Frieden said. Payments today accounts for 80% of P97’s revenue, but “looking out two or three years from now, that becomes more like 60% of our business,” Frieden estimated. It seems to me that gas stations are not the only ones in a race to the bottom: Digital payments has also proven to be a pretty thin-margin business. That is one reason why you see companies like Stripe and PayPal building out full stacks of related services that it sells to its payments customers. I asked Frieden if any of these companies had approached P97, which is complementary and different from them in that it’s identified a very specific vertical and built out payments and commerce technology that speaks to what they do and need. “We’ve been approached,” Frieden replied slowly and a little cagily. It’s unclear if “approach” in his mind meant more partnerships or acquisitions or investments. He’s not your typical founder, with a deep Texas drawl and decades of experience — yet not in Silicon Valley or other classically tech corridors, but the oil and gas industry and building technology for them. But he is learning the lingo fast and interested in taking this to the next level as any founder would be. With 58% growth last year, and a lot plans in play, Frieden is in no rush to sell, he said. “We’re just starting to scale up our two-sided network effects.”"
108,Pietra helped creators start DTC businesses; now it has a roadmap for everyone,['@christinemhall'],"May 2, 2023","The direct-to-consumer business world continues to be noisy. It’s not enough to just start up a business and advertise on Google and Facebook: Today’s e-commerce merchants have to be masters of all channels. That’s where Pietra comes in. The ex-Uber team, led by Ronak Trivedi, co-founder and CEO, started in 2019 as a marketplace for jewelry sellers and pivoted in 2021 to help creators build out back ends for launching and scaling product lines, raising $15 million in Series A capital in the process. “It is becoming increasingly difficult to run a profitable DTC business or e-commerce business,” Trivedi said in an interview. “We’re entering an era where you can’t just overspend and hack your way to continued growth. There are more channels and with lots of brands online, you need to stand out. Your content needs to be great and you need to innovate and be smart about how you grow your business online.” Since 2021, the e-commerce infrastructure company’s approach to guiding customers through the process of creating an e-commerce business, including giving them access to over 1,000 suppliers for everything from sourcing to order fulfillment, has now yielded them 100,000 active users. Pietra also ended 2022 with a 100x increase in transaction volume and a 35x increase in year over year revenue. Today, the company announced it closed on $16 million in new capital in the form of a Series A extension, led by M13. Founders Fund, which led the initial Series A, also participated in this round as did TQ Ventures and Abstract Ventures. Pietra raised $36 million in total, and the recent round boosted the company’s valuation 30%, Trivedi said. Pietra’s logistic dashboard. Image Credits: Pietra Pietra’s logistic dashboard. Image Credits: Pietra With the new funding, Pietra enters the commerce enablement sector with a revamped Pietra Membership, a monthly subscription starting at $39 a month for access to free software tools on everything from returns to influencer marketing. It also has a third-party logistics network and sales and distribution channel. You can use Pietra for free. Currently, about 10% of its users are paid, Trivedi said. In addition, the company plans to expand internationally, double its team and expand operations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York in 2023. Trivedi called the recent round “opportunistic.” The company still had over two years of runway, but wanted to bring in some additional employees and meet demand it was not able to service last year. For example, Pietra had those 100,000 customer sign ups, but were only able to onboard a fraction of those as customers. In addition, the company didn’t want to raise a full series B yet until it hit some internal milestones with customers and product offerings. “We want to build the world’s largest membership network for companies,” Trivedi said. “Over time, Pietra is going to provide all of the tools, apps and software that people are used to spending a lot of money on, but will be available to members at a fraction of the price.” Meanwhile, as part of the investment, Carter Reum and Brent Murri from M13 are joining Pietra’s board. Reum, co-founder and managing partner, started M13 with his brother, Courtney Reum, after selling their spirits business Veev to Luxco in 2016. He also watched his wife, Paris Hilton, scale her e-commerce business into a $4 billion empire, so to him, Pietra understood how to build a business from the ground up to distribution. “Them having 100,000 members and 9,000 paying subscribers, shows you that thesis is spot on,” Reum told TechCrunch. “After tracking this company for two years, they’re at that precipice moment of all these things colliding: I love their background at Uber, their ability to think as a platform and how to power the next generation of DTC companies.”  "
109,"When life gives you carbon, make Carbonaide",['@Haje'],"March 28, 2023","Concrete is ubiquitous. A mainstay of the construction industry, over 10 billion cubic meters of concrete is used every year. It’s also responsible for up to 8% of CO2 emissions: one ton of ordinary Portland cement creates somewhere between 800 and 900 kilograms of CO2 emissions. Finnish startup Carbonaide has just raised €1.8 million (~$1.9 million at today’s exchange rate) in seed funding to knock down concrete’s carbon emissions, but not the construction industry. “Our goal at Carbonaide is to create a more sustainable future with cutting-edge tech that doesn’t just reduce the carbon emissions of construction materials like concrete, but that traps more CO2 than they emit throughout their lifetime,” explains Tapio Vehmas, Carbonaide’s CEO. “It is very natural that the constructed environment becomes a CO2 sink, as it is the largest volume of man-made material.” Carbonaide’s process binds carbon dioxide into precast concrete using an automated system at atmospheric pressure. By reducing the quantity of required cement content and mineralizing CO2 into the concrete itself, Carbonaide believes it can halve the carbon dioxide emissions of traditional Portland cement concrete. If it can introduce industrial waste products, for example, industry slag, green liquor dregs, and bio-ash into the process, it has the potential to produce concrete with a negative carbon footprint. The next step for Carbonaide is to scale the technology into a production line at its factory in Hollola, Finland, which is where this seed funding round comes in. “The goal for this funding round is to scale the technology into an industrial-scale pilot factory. With the funding, we can implement the technology into a precast concrete production line that allows carbon curing as a part of the industrial process,” says Vehmas. “When we have done that, we will know exactly the cost structure and needed parameters for effective curing,” because it does need to add up.   “Can we develop technical solutions that also make sense commercially? Low-carbon products have to have a lower price than normal products. Otherwise, we can’t be sure that our technology will prevail,” says Vehmas. Carbonaide has calculated that a fully operational chain could mineralize up to five tons of CO2 per day and increase production by 100-fold of its carbon-negative concrete products, but it’s not just about making this type of concrete industrially scalable. Carbonaide also needs to bring the naturally conservative construction industry with it. “The technology must fit in perfectly, otherwise, it won’t make a change,” says Vehmas. “The industry is very conservative, but there is a good reason for that. We build structures that are meant to last, and by being conservative, we can ensure that they will remain in the future.” It’s easy to say that if something isn’t broken, it doesn’t need to be fixed, but Vehmas recognizes how the carbon footprint of concrete is breaking the Earth, and it does need to be fixed: “I want to see how a low-carbon industry can become a reality in highly conservative markets. If we can make this happen, maybe our generation will have some hope to pay our carbon debt for future generations.” Importantly, Vehmas has experience in the construction industry that he can bring on this quest, and he believes that the investment that Carbonaide has raised validates both its necessity and viability. “I also have 20+ years of experience working with concrete, meaning I have dealt with industry my whole adulthood. I basically live and breathe concrete. That helps a lot when introducing new technology into a highly conservative industry,” says Vehmas. “This investment is a sign of good progress for us because we’ve received the support and backing of players in the industry already.” Backing for Carbonaide comes from Lakan Betoni and Vantaa Energy, which led the seed funding. The round was completed with public loans and in-kind contributions from Business Finland and other Finnish concrete companies and strategic investors.   The concrete and energy companies supporting Carbonaide are doing so in more ways than just financially. They are also able to provide CO2 for Carbonaide’s processes, because believe it or not, while too much carbon dioxide is fizzing its way into the atmosphere, the captive kind that we need for everything from concrete to soda is in short supply. If Carbonaide’s pilot factory goes to plan, Vehmas hopes that it can have a planet-saving impact on the construction industry. “After the piloting, our goal is to commercialize the technology. We want to make this process easy to implement by packing the technology into a modular unit that is easy to install and enables easy implementation of the technology on-site,” says Vehmas. “If everything goes as I dream, our technology will start a process where the constructed environment becomes a carbon sink in the future, not a source of massive emissions.”"
110,"Trading-focused blockchain Sei raises $30M, bringing valuation up to $800M",['@jacqmelinek'],"April 11, 2023"," Sei, a layer-1 blockchain focused on trading, has raised $30 million, Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, exclusively told TechCrunch. A company spokesperson shared an $800 million valuation for the round with TechCrunch prior to publication. While many Layer-1 blockchains provide general-purpose networks that developers can build on top of, Sei focuses on the crypto trading network through its chain. Its team is made up of former employees from Goldman Sachs, Databricks, Robinhood, Google and Nvidia. “Our mission is to build the best infrastructure for exchanges,” Jog said, adding that the blockchain also has projects building games, NFT marketplaces and rollups. “It’s not just DeFi, but other [applications] that derive demand from trading.” The firm raised capital to gain the “right strategic partners, especially going into mainnet,” Jog said. The money will also be used to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, he added. The blockchain is still in its public testnet phase and plans on launching its mainnet later this year, hopefully in the second quarter, he added. Blockchains use testnet periods to run and test projects on their network prior to a full launch. “From our side, we had ample runway,” Jog said. Sei raised a $5 million seed round in August 2022, but said the primary goal for this round wasn’t “just focused on capital, but to get the right set of partners.” Investors in the new round include Jump Crypto, Distributed Global, Multicoin Capital, Asymmetric Capital Partners, Flow Traders, Hypersphere Ventures and Bixin Ventures. In September, Sei launched a $50 million ecosystem and liquidity fund to support new DeFi applications on its platform. The blockchain has over 120 projects building on its blockchain. Its latest public testnet attracted about 3.6 million unique users and processed over 35 million transactions in less than a month in mid-March, the company said. “There will be a lot of crypto-native adoption, but there need to be applications that are more general and super inclusive for there to be greater adoption,” Jog said. Update: The lede was amended to include more precision concerning the valuation figure. "
111,‘Amex-meets-SecretNYC for Gen-Z’ startup raises $15.4M equity round to expand globally,['@mikebutcher'],"April 17, 2023","A U.K. credit card rewards startup aimed at millennials and Gen Z consumers has stumbled upon a combined business model that has now secured it £12.5 million ($15.4 million in an equity round from investors. Yonder is a credit card closest in operation to Amex or Chase Sapphire in the U.S.; however, it combines that credit card shopping model with a points-based rewards scheme to use at London venues such as cinemas, wine merchants and eateries. In other words, it’s as if it was a combination of a travel experience startup and a credit card. Indeed, co-founder Tim Chong, Yonder CEO told me: “One customer literally described us as a combination of Amex meets Secret London/NYC and Monzo.” As well as the £12.5 millionin equity round it’s also raised £50 million of debt in order to expand its offers in the U.K., outside of its home base in London. As Chong told me: “We’re not a bank. So we need to finance the credit card receivables when you spend on the card. It’s a debt warehouse. So the debt is financing the credit card assets specifically.” The Series A funding round was backed by capital firms Northzone and RTP Global, with angel investors Joseph Moore, Crust Bros founder, and Kunal Shah, the founder of Cred, joining existing major shareholders Sharmadean Reid, GoCardless founder Matt Robinson and former footballer Rio Ferdinand. “It’s bringing together much more of a city companion experience, rather than just doing a bunch of financial product. It’s very much experience-led, much more like how you could describe an Airbnb experience whereas versus the Booking.com experience. At the moment, just where we’re starting, but our plan is to take this global,” Chong added. Expat founders Chong, Harry Jell and Theso Jivajirajah launched Yonder after being unable to find good credit options for “expats” in the U.K. Yonder plans to extend its round to members through a private crowdfund, going live in April. The funding has resulted in a post-money valuation of more than £70 million."
112,Our favorite startups from YC’s Winter 2023 Demo Day — Part 1,"['Natasha Mascarenhas', 'Alex Wilhelm', 'Devin Coldewey', 'Anna Heim', 'Tim De Chant', 'Christine Hall']","April 5, 2023","Here’s a crazy statistic: More than half of the companies in Y Combinator’s latest cohort were accepted to the accelerator with only an idea, no minimum viable product or revenue strategy needed. Fast forward to today, where we’ll see how the individuals behind those ideas are thinking about the future of how we work, eat, connect and build. YC Demo Day is always a window into a subset of entrepreneurs, used to help us better understand how this world may play into the kinds of companies entering the market.   Before we get into some standout companies, here’s some background on the latest batch: The most common verticals were developer operations, open source and artificial intelligence. On the diversity front, YC says that 17% of the Winter 2023 companies have a woman founder, which is up from 15% in the previous batch. OK, let’s start! Now, there’s a reason we are journalists, not investors, so let’s be clear: What we’ve written on the startups listed below are not meant as advice to join or back a startup; we’re highlighting which companies stood out to us during the rapid-fire pitching of Y Combinator’s 36th Demo Day.

elcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. This week, I look into cybersecurity sales, developer content marketing, and fundraising pitches through a common lens: The importance of understanding your audience and putting it first. — Anna Budget cuts brought on by the economic downturn have caused a shift in the priorities and mindsets of chief information security officers (CISOs). As security practitioners start reporting to corporate boards, they need to understand how to do so and be more business-focused than technical-focused, says marketing expert Dani Woolf. Woolf knows CISOs well; having spent her career in B2B tech marketing, she spent months interviewing cybersecurity buyers for her podcast before launching her own audience research agency, Audience 1st, to help vendors get better at understanding their target. A key challenge at the moment is for cybersecurity vendors to adapt to the buyers’ new mindset — which Woolf thinks will remain even after the market recovers. “There’s this huge gap right now in that vendors are adding more complexity to the security buyer job, and they don’t understand that simplicity is the goal.” Simplicity, however, doesn’t mean pitching one tool to replace them all. One of the main things that buyers want to hear from a vendor, Woolf told me, is how well are you integrating with their existing tech stack. “Because as a buyer, I can’t rip out what I have right now.” "
114,Portable X-ray vision is one step closer to reality with OXOS Medical,['@Haje'],"April 5, 2023","The global medical imaging market was valued at a touch over $28 billion in 2021, and is only expected to rise with an increase in demand for early-detection services as well as lifestyle and age-related conditions. Yet at the same time as demand for radiology services is increasing, the number of available radiographers is decreasing. In the U.S., almost half of radiographers are approaching retirement age and there are fewer residents lining up to fill their soon-to-be vacancies. The situation in the U.K. is similarly critical, with a shortfall of 1,670 radiologists reported in the 2021 Royal College of Radiologists census, and no improvement in sight. It’s an area that’s not just ripe for improvement, but where the problem is urgent. It’s against that backdrop that OXOS Medical just raised $23 million in Series A funding with the intention of delivering a “radiology department in a box.” “X-ray is the primary medical imaging modality, used at the beginning or end of over 70% of health interventions, but 80% of the world lacks access to imaging,” explains OXOS’ CEO and co-founder, Evan Ruff. Clearly, a lack of supply has the potential to negatively impact healthcare provision for millions of people, and OXOS believes it can help to alleviate that. “We aim to put safe, powerful and simple X-ray technology in the hands of urgent care centers, sports teams, home care and international mission operations, where a real-time diagnosis is critical to saving human lives.” This $23 million Series A funding was from Parkway Venture Capital and Intel Capital, and brings OXOS Medical’s total funding to $45 million. It also saw Gregg Hill, Parkway Venture Capital co-founder and managing partner, and Eric King, Intel Capital investment director, join the OXOS board of directors to help accelerate the company’s growth. Ruff explained how this funding will be used to help scale up OXOS, as well as push on with its technological advantages.   “This fundraise was all about setting OXOS up for scale,” says Ruff. “As a small company, there are certain things that we just can’t do. This money unlocks a number of new initiatives, everything from cost reduction activities, to product development, to advanced research, and other initiatives. Our goal is for anyone, anywhere, to be able to unpack an OXOS device and have a complete radiography solution available immediately.” While OXOS is keen to continue to supply devices in traditional markets, it also recognizes that its technology is suited for use in a wide variety of medical and non-medical settings. “OXOS devices use 80% less radiation than existing devices, shifting the envelope of what’s possible in radiography,” says Ruff. “OXOS’ smart and safe technology addresses the growing needs of orthopedic and radiographic professionals across all care scenarios, expanding access well beyond established sectors. We’re seeing massive pull into urgent care, professional sports and family practices, as well as other non-medical applications.” OXOS claims that its devices are the only ones on the market that can provide both static images (digital radiography) and live imaging (dynamic digital radiography), for both diagnostic and surgical radiography, in any setting. Together with their low radiation profiles, and the ability to provide imaging from a small form factor, which is viewable by medical practitioners anywhere on any device via the OXOS Cloud Platform, OXOS believes it can make X-rays more accessible. If the short-term goals focus on scaling, volume and pushing into other sectors, what about the long-term future for OXOS? “Every year, the U.S. spends over $50 billion on radiography. There is another $75 to $100 billion spent worldwide. OXOS technology provides a safe, point-and-click, end-to-end solution for every one of those use cases,” says Ruff, showing how big a market is available to it, and how it’s possible to make a positive impact on healthcare. “As our volumes increase and the number of deployed OXOS devices increases, the OXOS platform will be a huge resource for researchers and diagnostic innovators to build on, automating radiographic diagnostics and making healthcare cheaper.” “As we execute on our goals, OXOS will grow into an independent, public company,” says Ruff."
115,"Twitter alternative T2 launches new verification program, hires Discord engineering head as CTO",['@sarahintampa'],"March 30, 2023","As Twitter begins its shift to a “pay to play” business model, a new Twitter alternative is preparing to take flight. T2, the seed-funded Twitter rival developed by Google and Twitter veterans, is ready to capitalize on Twitter’s upheaval with the launch of a verification program specifically targeting those who are poised to lose their checkmark under Elon Musk’s new Twitter policies. T2 is also today announcing a notable new hire with the addition of Discord’s former Senior Director of Engineering Michael Greer as its new Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Greer joined Discord in 2017, initially as director of Engineering, which touched on a number of areas, including revenue, growth, apps, community servers, design systems, messaging and more. He was promoted to senior director of Engineering just last June. Prior to Discord, Greer worked as the CTO at Tapp Media and The Onion for multiyear stints. At T2, Greer will now oversee the development team and guide the company’s technical growth. “Michael’s deep experience across news, entertainment, and social platforms maps perfectly to our vision for T2,” said T2 co-founder Gabor Cselle, who sold his prior companies to Twitter and Google prior to starting T2. “At the Onion and Tapp, he and his teams built platforms that generated engagement from millions of users. At Discord, he directed his teams to create tools that have successfully maintained safety and civility — even in energetic, raucous communities,” Cselle added. T2’s development has been fairly rapid, having only committed its first lines of code in November 2022, then raising its first outside funding with a $1.1 million seed round this January. While there are a number of Twitter alternatives now gaining traction in the wake of Elon Musk’s chaotic takeover of Twitter, one of T2’s biggest differentiators is its co-founding team. Cselle previously sold his Y Combinator-backed email startup reMail to Google and his second company, native ads startup Namo Media, to Twitter. Meanwhile, Sarah Oh was Twitter’s former human rights advisor and has a wealth of experience, including time spent on Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica-focused crisis team. Oh says she was intrigued by “the possibility of centering a new platform that was simple and elegant around trust and safety.” “I found it so compelling to start from scratch — build in all the lessons from the last five to 10 years,” she explained to TechCrunch in a chat ahead of today’s announcements. “On the rules side, I think there’s a lot of space for growth and closing the enforcement gap,” Oh continues. “We have really clear rules that we’re beginning to consult our communities and users on — whether or not people feel like these rules are in the right place, where we need to maybe be a little bit more aggressive or less aggressive…But we’re very bullish on being very upfront about what we expect on the platform,” she added. This clarity will also assist T2 with moderation as it scales, which will include both human review and AI. On the face of it, however, T2 as of today looks much like a stripped-down Twitter clone. The currently web-only app has a similar interface to Twitter for writing short posts, adding a photo, posting replies and reposting or favoriting content. There’s also a highly visible reporting mechanism indicated with a flag icon beneath each post. Also like Twitter, T2 uses the same follower/following model for building out a network of people whose posts you want to see in your timeline. (As an early tester, I was surprised to find T2 was automatically following people for me — something it said it was doing to seed people’s initial networks.) Despite its still scrappy nature — T2 isn’t even the startup’s final name, apparently, it’s only a placeholder — the company is moving forward to grow its user base. T2 has been starting to test the usage of community invites among different groups, we’re told. Once the startup better understands how and why invites are being distributed by users — and the success rates those invites have in terms of bringing in new members — it will widen access. This will likely be in one or two months. “We know that people want to feel immediately connected to their friends and colleagues on a new social media platform,” said Oh. “We’re currently testing and rolling out community invites, which will help people connect with and welcome their existing personal networks onto T2. Right now, we’re testing with various kinds of users from different cohorts. Once we have a clearer idea of what works best, we’ll start rolling out the feature more broadly,” she noted. Image Credits: T2 screenshot Image Credits: T2 screenshot In the near term, T2 is debuting a new verification process with the launch of its “Get the Checkmark” program timed to correspond to Twitter’s removal of legacy verification checkmarks across all users who aren’t paying for the Twitter Blue subscription. Twitter said its own checkmark removals will begin on April 1st and will include removing the verification from organizations and individuals who had previously qualified as “notable” under the company’s prior rules. Ahead of this, T2 users who are legacy checkmark holders can claim their T2 checkmark by filling out this form. Image Credits: T2 Image Credits: T2 T2 believes this serves as an ideal opportunity to cater to Twitter’s disgruntled users. Prior to April 1st (or whenever Twitter actually removes verified checks), T2 will verify its own users if they previously had Twitter verification. The company says that Twitter’s legacy process required verifying people’s identities, so it will continue to honor those checks on T2. These “Twitter legacy” T2 checkmarks will have little ruffles on them, as well. Twitter accounts may have been verified if they were a company, nonprofit, journalist, leader or executive, an individual in entertainment, an individual in sports, a content creator or some other public figure or notable individual.  After Twitter removes its legacy checkmarks, T2 will switch over to a new verification flow. For now, while the app is small and in closed testing, this will involve chatting directly with a T2 representative. (A process that would make it very hard for bots to be verified!) Later on, T2 plans to scale this verification using in-app identity and selfie checks. These will be designated as “T2 Authenticated” profiles. Though T2 remains in closed beta testing, the company has been slowly inviting people to join from its “five-digit” waitlist and has now begun to offer its community members invites they can dole out to others. The plan is to trial invites with a few more communities before a wider rollout begins. In addition to these changes, T2 also revamped its logo and introduced its own version of Twitter’s long-lost “fail whale,” which appeared when the site had outages. On T2 it will be a “fail snail” instead (see below). The app’s user interface has been polished up as well, with new iconography beyond the logo and other changes to make it a better experience for end users.  Image Credits: T2 Image Credits: T2"
116,Elevate lands $28M to help employers better manage benefits,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 13, 2023","Elevate, a consumer benefits administration platform, today announced that it raised $28 million in a funding round led by Anthemis with participation from Fin Capital Norwest Venture Partners, Greycroft, Bowery Capital and Firebolt Ventures. The new cash, which brings Elevate’s total raised to $43 million, will be put toward product development, hiring and customer acquisition, according to CEO Brian Cosgray. “Having worked at legacy benefits companies, Elevate’s founding team all saw what the industry lacked — flexible and scalable technology that met the needs of the changing workforce,” he told TechCrunch in an email interview. “These legacy company platforms were built using the best practices twenty years ago, but a lot has changed in two decades. Elevate started from scratch using the best technologies of today, like AI, keeping employee’s needs at its core and delivering on their expectations of a modern experience.” Cosgray, whose background is in private wealth management, co-founded Elevate after selling his previous startup, DoubleNet Pay, to Purchasing Power in 2018. With Elevate, he sought to address some of the major pain points in employee benefits processing, like the long turnaround time for claims. Using Elevate, employees can view, plan and manage pre-tax benefits from a dashboard on the web or mobile. Elevate offers real-time reimbursement for benefits such as health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts and a contactless card that supports popular mobile payment providers (e.g. Apple Pay). Elevate’s benefits management dashboard. Image Credits: Elevate Elevate’s benefits management dashboard. Image Credits: Elevate Claims are processed “instantly” through Elevate, Cosgray says, with managers receiving reports just as quickly (if the sales pitch is to be believed). “Legacy benefits platforms still use people behind the scenes to process claims. On average it takes up to three business days to process a claim,” Cosgray said. “Elevate’s platform leverages AI technology, so claims are processed quickly.” Elevate occupies a space — employee benefits platforms — that’s full of vendors, some of which rival it directly. Fringe and Forma enable companies to offer customizable perks and benefits to employees. Cobee is developing an employee benefits “superapp” complete with a payment card and payroll software integrations. Cosgray credits the pandemic with Elevate’s growth, asserting that it encouraged businesses to seek out “agile and tech-native benefits partners” to keep pace with changing the workplace needs (i.e. the shift to remote and hybrid work). “The way modern business is done keeps changing and that change only helps us, because our platform is scalable and configurable to fit partners’ needs and grow with them,” he added. “With our new capital, we’re not just the smarter option, but the sustainable option, which is crucial for employees and employers using our platform.” Cosgray claims that Elevate has formed more than half a dozen partnerships that service a user base in the “six-figure” range. He wouldn’t talk in detail about revenue or burn rate, save that the new funding gives Elevate, which has around 45 full-time employees, more than three years of runway. Anthemis managing director Kate Sampson, an investor, had this to say via email: “Although many have recognized the legacy provider experience was due for a complete overhaul, Elevate stands alone among the next-generation challengers with its capabilities to administer all plan types on a single, unified platform and card. In an age where employers are looking to drive efficiencies while also bringing modern, relevant benefit solutions to employees, we don’t think the current point solutions are going to find scale.”"
117,This could be AI’s light bulb moment,['@ron_miller'],"May 2, 2023","In the 19th century, electricity was the primary technology that was driving innovation, but it wasn’t until it was practically applied with inventions like the light bulb and the telephone that it stimulated the public’s imagination. With the release of ChatGPT last year, it triggered what some industry experts believe is a light bulb moment for AI where the utility of the technology became readily apparent to people outside of tech. Stephen Wolfram, the computer scientist, physicist and founder and CEO at Wolfram Alpha, is one of those people who sees the current situation much like the 19th century when electricity was put to work in practical ways that had a palpable impact on ordinary folks. “We think about computation as this enabling technology,” he said last month in an interview at the Imagination in Action conference at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “In the long-distant past, electricity was an enabling technology that lots of people were interested in … And the analogy I thought of with ChatGPT is something like the first telephone that actually worked. People had known in principle that there should be ways to kind of humanize electricity to be useful for human communication. And people had tried for a long time.” That moment came in 1877 when Alexander Graham Bell started Bell Telephone as a commercial entity to sell phones and transformed human communication. Peter Levine, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, similarly sees the current state of AI as this “aha moment,” and as with electricity, one that took some time to develop into practical applications. “People have been working on this for a long time. It’s been [being] refined for a long time, which makes it really interesting, probably in the same way that electricity was. And it’s the first time the light bulb goes on in the street. People are like, ‘wow, I get it,’” Levine said. Wolfram pointed out that the power of this approach lies in the linguistic user interface, which gives us the ability to interact directly with the AI. “We’ve managed to take what’s out there on the web, in books and so on, and get something which takes all of that text and is able to produce reasonable human text [as a response],” he said. That may have a profound impact on enterprise software moving forward, something every startup developing a product today needs to be thinking about. AI is going to be table stakes for every company from now on, according to Levine. “AI will be a property of every application going forward, and this is the moment where that starts to happen, where just as a database or an operating system is part of every application today, I believe that AI will be a property of every application,” he said. That could change the way we think about how applications function and how we interact with them. Vishal Sikka, CEO and founder at Vianai Systems, an MLOps startup, who was formerly CEO at Infosys, thinks it’s a bit more complicated than that, especially for enterprise companies. He believes we might not be at that aha moment yet in business, and it could take longer than we think for this technology to mainstream inside companies, especially in mission-critical applications."

One line of code says, “A game on your TV needs a controller to play. Do you want to use this phone as a game controller?” The findings point to a major move from the company as it shifts from smartphones and tablets to the big screen.

Plus, Netflix posted a job listing last November for a game director to work on a AAA PC game. The company also said it would expand into cloud gaming, according to Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt in October 2022. Since Netflix entered the mobile gaming space in 2021, the company has released more than 55 titles, ranging from original titles based on IP like “Stranger Things” and “The Queen’s Gambit” to popular games such as Heads Up!, Vikings: Valhalla, Valiant Hearts and Country Friends, among others. Netflix recently announced its 2023 slate of mobile games, which includes 40 titles like Mighty Quest: Rogue Palace. There are 70 games in development. Next year, subscribers will get access to the popular puzzle games Monument Valley 1 and Monument Valley 2. While Netflix doesn’t disclose how many of its subscribers play the mobile games, an Apptopia report from August 2022 indicated that less than 1% of subs are interested in playing them. Netflix’s upcoming feature will likely convince a few more players to check it out, but it remains to be seen just how many.  "
120,Microsoft kickstarts settlement discussions with European cloud companies over antitrust complaints,['@psawers'],"April 20, 2023","Microsoft has kickstarted settlement discussions with European not-for-profit trade association Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), some six months after CISPE filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Microsoft was using its dominance in business software to tether customers to its Azure cloud platform. The news comes less than a month after news emerged that Microsoft was close to settling a separate complaint with a trio of cloud organizations in Europe, including France’s OVHcloud, Italy’s Aruba and Denmark’s industry association Danish Cloud Community. The trio filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission (EC) last March, alleging that Microsoft made it more expensive to run its software in rival clouds compared to its own Azure platform, while also making it technically more difficult to run some of the programs. While Aruba is also a member of CISPE, it seems that CISPE elected to launch a separate antitrust case against Microsoft, noting at the time that it wanted to “give a voice to those members without the resources to file their own complaints, or for whom the fear of retaliation is too great to risk standing alone.” As an aside, OVHcloud was also a CISPE member until January, though it didn’t renew its membership. It is worth noting here, however, that Amazon’s cloud juggernaut AWS is also a member of CISPE, so this may not be as much a David versus Goliath battle as first seems. The crux of the issue relates to a 2019 licensing change enacted by Microsoft, effectively making it more expensive to run Microsoft’s omnipresent enterprise software on rival cloud services. Fast-forward to last year’s snowballing antitrust legal challenges, and Microsoft revealed it was making some changes designed to make “bringing workloads and licenses to partners’ clouds easier,” which it did to an extent — with the notable exceptions of so-called “listed providers” that include AWS, Google, and Alibaba. So in effect, Microsoft is kinda making it easier for companies to run Microsoft software on non-Azure clouds, but only if they’re not using Microsoft’s main rivals’ infrastructure. And that is why we’ve seen CISPE, which counts AWS as one of its biggest backers, continue to challenge Microsoft through legal channels. And it’s also why Google recently slammed Microsoft’s impending settlement with OVHcloud, Aruba and Danish Cloud Community, accusing Microsoft of antitrust practices while insinuating that a deal specifically with smaller cloud rivals might not be to Google’s advantage. At any rate, CISPE confirmed today that Microsoft has approached it with an “outline settlement agreement,” with its member companies now starting negotiations to what CISPE says it hopes will “return fair competition to the European cloud infrastructure sector.” Details are still rather vague at this stage, with CISPE merely saying that Microsoft has made some proposals around its licensing terms. But the organization notes that it has “several red lines” which Microsoft must satisfy before any deal can be reached. For example, it said that any deal that is ultimately reached should be applicable to all cloud infrastructure providers and customers in Europe, and it needs to be implemented in a way that makes Microsoft accountable for any commitments it makes far into the future. “Any business must have the right to run the software they license on the cloud of their choice, without financial or technical penalties,” CISPE notes. “[And] Any settlement must be transparent and clear, open to scrutiny, future-proof and auditable for compliance over time.” Even if Microsoft does reach a settlement with CISPE, the company is still facing the heat from other quarters over its cloud practices. The U.K., for example, is readying an investigation into the domestic cloud infrastructure market, with the practices of Amazon and Microsoft particularly in its crosshairs. Regulator Ofcom said that it has identified practices that make it more difficult for businesses to switch between cloud providers, or even adopt a hybrid approach. Back across the water in the EU, CISPE says there is “still a long way to go” before anything is agreed, and there are “several important issues” that are still to be addressed. “Our members are scrutinizing the proposed changes and settlement agreement and will provide feedback to Microsoft in the coming days, including on key elements that are required to solve sector-wide issues,” CISPE added. In response to questions from TechCrunch, a Microsoft spokesperson issued this statement: In October 2022 we introduced software licensing changes to address concerns raised with the European Commission and provide new opportunities for cloud providers. Since then, we have continued productive discussions with European cloud providers and are confident we can address valid concerns. *This article was updated on April 21 with additional context on the history leading up to Microsoft’s antitrust wrangles in the European cloud market, as well as comment from Microsoft."
121,"Acorns acquires UK’s GoHenry, a fintech focused on 6- to 18-year-olds",['@bayareawriter'],"April 3, 2023","U.S.-based savings and investing startup Acorns has acquired London-based GoHenry, a startup focused on providing money management and financial education services to 6- to18-year-olds in an all-equity deal, the two companies announced today. The combined valuation of the company, as well as further financial terms, were not disclosed. When Acorns last raised funding, $300 million in March 2022, it was valued at $2 billion; GoHenry has not disclosed its valuation but was believed to be valued at between $250 million and $500 million in October 2022, when it raised $55 million. The acquisition is notable for a couple of reasons. For one, if the companies have managed to keep their valuations level (valuations have seen a lot of pressure in the last six months) it would be one of the bigger M&A deals between two fintech startups, coming at a time when startups have found it very challenging to raise further funding — either from private investors, or from the public markets by way of an IPO. Second of all, it will add a number of new backers to Acorns’ cap table. GoHenry’s investors include Edison Partners, Revaia, Citi Ventures, Muse Capital and Nexi, which are all rolling over their equity in the deal. Lastly, this gives Acorns an opening to grow internationally, starting with GoHenry’s existing footprint across the U.K., France, Italy and Spain. The companies would not provide specific details regarding individual metrics, saying only that the combined company will have nearly 6 million subscribers. Previous TechCrunch coverage helps us break down the mix, but also points to either or both having lost some users in recent times. In March of 2022, CEO Noah Kerner told TechCrunch that the company had more than 4.6 million paid subscribers. GoHenry last October said it had 2 million customers. Since its 2012 inception, Acorns has raised just over $500 million from investors, such as private equity firm TPG, BlackRock, Greycroft, Owl Rock (a division of Blue Owl), Senator Investment Group, Torch Capital, Industry Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Galaxy Digital, Headline and Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman’s Thirty Five Ventures. Acorns is coming into this deal after it faced a setback on an earlier exit plan of its own. The company originally had intentions to go public, and in 2021 it laid out plans to do so by way of a SPAC. At the time, it had projected revenue of $126 million for the year, according to the deck analyzed by our own Alex Wilhelm. But with the SPAC market facing a lot of troubles, and the tech IPO market drying up at the end of 2021, Acorns scrapped its SPAC IPO plans in January of 2022. GoHenry (named after its first child-customer, according to the company) has raised a total of $125 million since it was founded in 2012. It posted $42 million in revenue in 2021 (the last complete year it reported), double what it made in 2020.  Neither Acorns nor GoHenry — both of which are 10 years old — were yet profitable at the time of their last raises. Acorns got its start initially targeting younger adults, specifically millennials, before later opening its first services for children. GoHenry will help it extend in that market segment. From its early days, GoHenry has focused on the 6 to 18 age group, which currently use two main services from the company: a prepaid debit card (topped up by parents typically) and a “financial education” app that links to that card (and an app that parents can use to help monitor and manage the account). Until last summer, GoHenry operated in the U.K. as well as in the U.S., where it had expanded to in 2018. It began servicing France and Spain when it acquired French startup Pixpay last July and it also opened up for business in Italy in January of this year. Acorns has evolved its offering to also include investment services, debt management and a product aimed at children, Acorns Early, which launched in June of 2020. Acorns Early lets parents, guardians, family and friends easily invest in a child’s future. Prior to GoHenry, Acorns had also acquired Vault, Harvest Platform and Pillar. The two companies’ executives say that the combined company will let them serve customers through all life stages — from birth to retirement. Acorns claims it has helped Americans save and invest more than $16 billion since its founding, while GoHenry’s customers saved $130 million in the last five years. The acquisition now puts Acorns directly in competition with other U.S.-based fintechs already offering debit cards to children and/or teens, including Greenlight, Step and Current. “Both of us have been dreaming about this idea for financial wellness for the whole family for a long time,” Kerner told TechCrunch in an interview, noting that the companies have been in conversations for two years. “So being able to serve kids, teens and adults holistically inside one company globally is really exciting.” GoHenry co-founder Louise Hill said she is “excited about the opportunities” the combination will unlock. “It’s very much a shared vision/mission, looking at the best interests of families, and the up and coming — the everyday people,” she said in an interview. “Being able to expand and offer the same approach to financial well-being to adults as well is hugely exciting.” The combined company — both of which offer subscription services — has more than 700 employees. While the deal was primarily equity, there was a “tiny cash consideration,” Hill said, that was more out of “administrative necessity than anything else.” The decision to acquire GoHenry was not one made lightly, according to Kerner, who said Acorns evaluated “over 100” companies globally. “We have been very focused on the U.S. market with our products but have always had aspirations to deliver globally,” he told TechCrunch. “This allows us to accelerate that path.” Hill said GoHenry too always had the intention to globalize. “Our teams have been talking together for over two years, and it just became more and more obvious that the right way to go was to come together,” she said. In the U.S., GoHenry will operate as GoHenry by Acorns. In the U.K. & Europe, GoHenry and PixPay will continue to operate under their own brands.  As the IPO market has dried up, many industry observers had predicted that the fintech space would see more consolidation. And so far in 2023, we’ve seen a number of M&A deals. For example, earlier this year, Marqeta announced plans to acquire two-year-old fintech infrastructure startup Power Finance for $223 million in cash, marking the first acquisition in that publicly traded company’s 13-year history. Also in January: investment giant BlackRock announced it was acquiring a minority stake in SMB 401(k) provider startup Human Interest; remote payroll startup Deel acquired fintech Capbase; Fidelity acquired equity management startup Shoobx; Vouch, an insurtech focused on startups, acquired lending startup Level; and American Express entered into an agreement to acquire Nipendo.

122,Lawmakers ask Department of Justice to investigate Warner Bros. Discovery merger,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 10, 2023","Four Democratic lawmakers have written to the Department of Justice to investigate Warner Bros. Discovery and launch an inquiry into alleged anti-competitive behavior. Democratic representatives Elizabeth Warren, Pramila Jayapal, David Cicilline and Joaquin Castro wrote that the merged company has harmed workers and reduced consumer choice. Warner Bros. Discovery was formed after WarnerMedia merged with Discovery Inc. in April 2022. “We respectfully urge the Justice Department to investigate the state of competition in affected labor and consumer markets following consummation of this merger, which appears to have enabled Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to adopt potentially anticompetitive practices that reduce consumer choice and harm workers in affected labor markets,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. Warner Bros. Discovery did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The lawmakers argue that Warner Bros. Discovery’s new ownership is “hollowing out an iconic American studio.” The letter outlines that many projects were cancelled by Warner Bros. Discovery not long after the merger, including “Batgirl,” which was canceled even though filming for the movie had already been completed. The letter also refers to the cancellation of popular shows like “Gordita Chronicles” and “The Time Traveler’s Wife.” In addition, the lawmakers note that Primetime Emmy Award winner J. J. Abrams is now shopping elsewhere for a home for his TV show “Demimonde” which was initially picked up by HBO and then canceled before production began on the project. The letter notes that consumers will likely never be able to watch shows purchased then cancelled by the company, and that Warner Bros. Discovery’s conduct amounts to a “catch and kill” practice that limits consumer choice. The lawmakers also outline that the company’s actions are leaving workers with fewer choices for employment and advancement. “Shortly after the merger was finalized, WBD began realizing a number of cost synergies that were used to justify the merger in the first place—including cuts to hundreds of jobs for working people,” the letter reads. “First, WBD cut the streaming platform CNN+. The CNN+ cut affected about 350 employees, and four months later, CNN laid off an additional 400 employees. WBD also enacted 100 layoffs in its company’s ad sales department as another cost-cutting effort related to the merger. In total, the aforementioned cuts affected thousands of people. Notably, WBD still has $3.5 billion in planned cuts—which does not bode well for workers.” The letter ends by asking the Department of Justice to take another look at the transaction and take into consideration the actions that the company has taken since the merger was finalized a year ago. The lawmakers write that they hope the guidelines for the merger are updated to ensure they reflect the needs of workers, consumers and content creators in the media and entertainment industry. The letter comes as Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to hold a press event sometime this week regarding its new direct-to-consumer streaming plan.  "
123,Substack opens up a $2 million community fundraising round,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 28, 2023","Substack is opening up a community fundraising round, letting writers invest in and own a piece of the company. The company announced on Tuesday that writers can make an investment, of at least $100, starting today via Substack’s Wefunder page. According to the page, Substack’s funding goal is $2 million. The company’s pre-money valuation is $585 million. As of Thursday morning, Substack has $6,686,954 in pledges. The company says it’s on a mission to build a new “economic engine” for culture, and that to do this, it needs to build a kind of network that is based on principles that give control to writers and readers. Substack is focused on building a subscription network founded on creator ownership. The company revealed that readers have paid writers more than $300 million through Substack, and that the platform now has more than 35 million active subscriptions, including two million paid subscriptions. Substack also revealed that more than 17,000 writers are earning money on Substack, with the top 10 publishers on Substack collectively making more than $25 million annually. “As Substack grows to accommodate more writers, podcasters, videomakers, musicians, scientists—and culture-makers of all kinds—we see a path to hundreds of millions of subscriptions and a significant cultural impact, which will in turn provide ample financial opportunity,” the company wrote. “We are at the dawn of the era of the subscription network. This work will be ambitious and exciting, and it will be meaningful. We’d love to have you by our side as we build this new economic engine for culture together.” Substack believes that subscription networks represent a step forward from social networks, and that while social networks are associated with advertising and attention, subscription networks are about direct payments and trust. The company explained in a blog post that after closing its $65 million Series B funding round in 2021, it explored ways to make it possible for writers to invest alongside traditional investors, but found that it was too complex, especially when trying to include people who weren’t already accredited investors. Substack says opening a community round is now more viable, especially due to crowdfunding platforms like Wefunder. “We are serious about building Substack with writers, and this community round is one way to concretize that ideal,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We’re doing this because the dynamics of a platform like Substack change if the people who are building their businesses on it are owners of it too. And we’re doing it because it not only provides something good for our company but also presents an opportunity for the people who use Substack to participate in the benefits that come from building this network—including the financial upside.” Substack notes that just because you’re able to invest in the company, doesn’t mean that you should. The company says potential investors should be aware that there is no guarantee that you will make your money back, noting that you shouldn’t invest any funds in the community round unless you can afford to lose the entire investment. The company’s Wefunder page indicates that unaccredited investors can legally invest a maximum of $2,200. Substack says if the round if oversubscribed, it may not be able to accept all investments and may reduce individual investments, in which case users will be refunded the difference. If the round is oversubscribed, the company will prioritize Substack writers who have turned on paid subscriptions and paying subscribers. The launch of the new community fundraising round comes as it was revealed in May 2022 that Substack had abandoned efforts to raise a Series C round after holding discussions with potential investors about raising $75 million to $100 million at a valuation of between $750 million and $1 billion, as reported by The New York Times. The decision to drop its funding efforts occurred amid an industrywide downturn as the market for venture investments cooled. In June 2022, the company then cut 13 jobs, representing 14% of its workforce. Substack has raised $86 million over three rounds of funding, according to PitchBook. In addition to a16z, it is backed by Fifty Years, Y Combinator and entrepreneur Audrey Gelman. Given Substack’s current trajectory, it’s possible that the company is focused on working for its customers (i.e. writers) instead of its investors and looking at becoming self-sustaining. Update 30/03/2023 11:40 AM ET: Article was updated to include the current amount of money raised.   "

125,"Meet Liquido, which aims to be the ‘Stripe of LatAm’ — but with even bigger ambitions",['@bayareawriter'],"May 4, 2023","The ability to offer businesses more ways to accept digital payments is crucial globally, but merchants’ specific needs typically differ based on geography. In recognition of those nuances, Liquido has for two years been working on building payments infrastructure aimed at modernizing payments access for businesses in Latin America. And today, the company is emerging from stealth to offer what it describes as core payment services that “serve a wide range of needs and customer preferences….through one unified and integrated API.”  Interestingly, while many companies in the U.S. may start out serving clients in their home country and later expand to LatAm, Mountain View, California-based Liquido started out specifically to serve the LatAm market. So far, it’s processed more than $300 million in payments through a closed beta with several consumer brands in the region ($20 million of that was processed in the first two quarters of 2022), and now says it’s ready to open access to cross border and local merchants across Latin America. Digital payment via credit cards is very common in the U.S., but in LatAm, where an estimated 28% even have credit cards, it is far less so. And even among those who do use credit cards, fraud is quite prevalent. Yet, the transaction value of digital commerce in Latin America was estimated at more than $100 billion in 2019 and is now expected to increase by about 73% by 2025, according to Statista. In a nutshell, Liquido wants to make it easier for people to buy things online. With Liquido, the startup touts that businesses can accept and process “all forms of payment” — from credit and debit cards to bank transfers to digital wallets, and even cash — in order to increase payment acceptance rates.  “Between my work at Uber and DiDi, I spent several years devoted to the LatAm market, and I was struck by the prevalence of cash payments for rides,” said Shanxiang Qi, Liquido co-founder and CTO. “This observation led me to conclude that even the middle and upper echelons of society in the region lacked convenient access to digital payments, which ultimately limited options for business.” Qi teamed up with MK Li,  a former VC who began his career as a product manager at Google and Microsoft. The pair say with Liquido, they are building in LatAm something “similar to what Stripe has built in the U.S.” but also expanding beyond traditional payments into extended payment services. “A company like Stripe or dLocal could work right now for the market but doesn’t quite provide the same level of seamless experience as they could do in Europe and the U.S.,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. “Their infrastructure is quite different. And also there are a lot of silos of different channels of payment. And, the users also have different preferences about payments as well as risk profiles. The fraud profile in the local market is drastically different.” To help remedy fraud, Liquido says it has built something called a “Payment Success Booster,” which does things like perform customizable fraud flagging and transaction blocking, WhatsApp payment recovery, flexible payment method switching and smart routing and retrying. The company says it has also built a Payment Plus Platform (PPP), which runs on top of its core payment services and is designed to “create customer experiences tailored to local markets and grow within verticals.” The company has now introduced the first offering for its PPP, something it calls the “WhatsApp Liquido-Store.” It allows merchants to create “a mini Shopify-like storefront within WhatsApp” without any coding knowledge required, they say, giving customers a way to browse, find and buy from merchants through WhatsApp, which is by far the most used social network in Latin America. Image credit: Liquido Image credit: Liquido Liquido says it also provides alternative solutions to help companies to make payroll payments as well as pay suppliers and associated businesses through bank transfers. Now, the company takes payments further. The startup in 2021 raised $26 million in funding across two rounds, both led by Index Ventures. Other backers include Base Partners, Restive Ventures, Mantis VC and UpHonest Capital.  “Shan and MK tapped into payments in a part of the world that was ripe for disruption,” said Mark Fiorentino, a partner at Index Ventures. “Based on their previous work, they each brought a depth of understanding to the issues and developed one of the most advanced, yet practical, payments systems found anywhere in the world.” Fiorentino is impressed with the evolution of the company’s offering over time, in particular, the addition of the WhatsApp Liquido store. “There’s an interesting opportunity to help increase conversion rates and LTV per user,” he said. “So suddenly this is not just a payments company, but more like payment-enabled software in a way that owns more of the revenue generation and cost reduction value chain.”  Want more fintech news in your inbox?

126,Paramount+ grows to 60M subs as it prepares to integrate with Showtime,['@laurenforristal'],"May 4, 2023","The previously announced integration of Showtime into Paramount+ draws closer as the company reports its first-quarter fiscal earnings. Paramount+ with Showtime is set to launch in the third quarter. While the integration is anticipated to generate around $700 million in future annual expense savings, which Paramount announced last quarter, it also resulted in a programming charge of $1.7 billion in Q1, the company said Thursday. “In connection with our plan to integrate Showtime into Paramount+ and initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy and close or globalize certain of our international channels, during the first quarter of 2023, we reviewed our content portfolio and determined that we would not use certain content on our platforms,” the company wrote in its letter to shareholders. “Accordingly, we recorded programming charges, which were comprised of impairment charges for content removed from our platforms or abandoned, development cost write-offs, and contract termination costs,” it added. As part of the integration, the company previously revealed it would raise subscription prices. Paramount+ gained 4.1 million subscribers in Q1, bringing the total to 60 million, up from 56 million subs in Q4 2022. The company attributed the global subscriber growth to its robust content library, such as “Star Trek: Picard,” the return of “Mayor of Kingstown,” “Teen Wolf: The Movie” and more. Paramount also reported Thursday a $1.1 billion loss and revenue of $7.3 billion, missing analyst expectations of $7.4 billion. Meanwhile, Paramount+ revenue increased 65% year-over-year. During the earnings call, the company said it expects healthy subscription revenue growth over the next several quarters as a result of Paramount+ combining with Showtime. The company recently announced that it is set to begin production for “Star Trek: Section 31” later this year. The original movie will be the first Star Trek film based on a character from “Star Trek: Discovery” and the first Star Trek movie to center on a single character. However, its “South Park” streaming rights are uncertain as it’s been sued by Warner Bros. Discovery, which claims Paramount violated the terms of the deal. Paramount is now countersuing the company. Pluto TV, its free ad-supported streaming service, reached 80 million monthly active users, compared to 78.5 million in the previous quarter.    "
127,"AI-generated chart toppers, Apple gets into savings, and Microsoft drops Twitter",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 22, 2023","Hello, friends, and welcome to the latest edition of Week in Review (WiR), the weekly newsletter where we recap the past several days (or so) in tech news. We’d argue that there’s no better way to get your news fix, but we’d be biased. Still! Trust us when we say it’s a labor of love. Before we get to this week’s happenings, don’t forget that Disrupt, TechCrunch’s annual flagship conference, is on the horizon. This year’s Disrupt will host six — that’s right, six — stand-alone industry TC Sessions events, with stages featuring industry-specific programming tracks. It’ll be well worth the trek to San Francisco. Ahead of that is our next TechCrunch Live session with SignalFire and ClassDojo. They’ll be discussing ClassDojo’s mission to revolutionize education by building a classroom community. Now, without further ado! Fake Drake: A song featuring the voices of Drake and The Weeknd called “Heart on My Sleeve” has amassed more than 250,000 Spotify streams and 10 million views on TikTok. But the two musicians had nothing to do with the song — an artist going by the name “Ghostwriter” generated the song using AI. Amanda has the story. Apple gets into savings: As of this week, Apple Card customers in the U.S. can open a savings account with Apple and earn up to 4.15% interest. Apple has partnered with Goldman Sachs for the banking feature; the savings accounts are technically managed by Goldman Sachs, which means that they’re covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Romain reports. Apple considers opening up: Apple has kept the iPhone app distribution system relatively closed so far, allowing users to download apps only from the App Store. But the company might add some gates to its walled garden soon. Ivan reports that Apple is considering letting people sideload apps on iPhones and that we might see some announcement related to that at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference in June. A massive Apple Watch update: The Apple Watch’s software is due to get the biggest update since its release. Sarah, citing a Bloomberg report, writes that the updated watchOS 10 will “bring bigger enhancements” than the releases planned for iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, including an “updated interface” that will tell you “most of what you need to know about the Apple Watch in 2023.” Love Is Blind, but sometimes canceled: Netflix had some serious issues with the livestream of its “Love Is Blind” reunion episode, Amanda writes. After a 75-minute delay, the streaming service pulled the plug on the live show due to seemingly unresolvable technical problems. Microsoft drops Twitter: Microsoft announced this week that it’s dropping Twitter from its advertising platform nearly two months after Twitter announced that it’ll begin charging a minimum of $42,000 per month to users of its API. With its $2.15 trillion market cap and roughly $100 billion cash on hand at the end of last year, Microsoft obviously has the money to pay Twitter what it wants, so the move appears to be a bit of a statement — even as Microsoft is declining to elaborate further about its decision. Meta lays off more workers: Meta issued another round of mass layoffs this week, Rebecca reports. They’re part of the 10,000 layoffs that CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March, many of which relate to “low priority projects.” The mass job cuts are part of a broader restructuring at Meta that Zuckerberg has dubbed the “year of efficiency,” which began with 11,000 layoffs announced in November. Check-in kiosks no more: Alaska Airlines recently started a three-year, $2.5 billion project to improve the airport experience at its hubs and focus cities like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a part of the project, the airline is looking to modernize the lobby experience — and as the company announced today, the most visible change here will be the removal of the good old check-in kiosk, Frederic writes. Snapchat’s AI comes to all: Snapchat’s AI chatbot is opening up to a global audience, the company announced at its Snap Partner Summit this week. Initially launched in February, the feature originally allowed Snapchat’s paid subscribers to chat with an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology directly in its app. Now it’ll be available for free and upgraded with such functionality as the ability to add the chatbot to group chats, get recommendations for places on Snap Map and Lenses, and share Snaps with the chatbot to receive chat replies.

Tesla’s most popular models will now start under $40,000 before incentives. Looking for podcast material to pass the time? TechCrunch has you covered, as always. This week, the Equity crew recorded at Early Stage, TechCrunch’s event for founders, and covered topics ranging from rockets to earnings and how a certain company is cutting costs. Over at Found, Trevor Martin, the co-founder of Mammoth Biosciences, came on to discuss how the company is using CRISPR systems to detect and cure genetic diseases. Chain Reaction interviewed Jesse Pollak, the lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase. And on the latest TechCrunch Live episode, Mark Batsiyan, a co-founder and partner at Inspired Capital, and Brynne McNulty Rojas, who’s the co-founder and CEO of Habi — the hot real estate startup out of Colombia that reached unicorn status last year — talked about their respective experiences in tech.

Here are a few highlights from this week: Photonics and AI: The growing compute power necessary to train sophisticated AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT might eventually run up against a wall with mainstream chip technologies. Are light-based chips, otherwise known as photonics chips, the answer? Maybe, but it’s not clear yet. There’s always money in the coffee stand: Blank Street claims to have cracked the code on how to make a chain of more than 65 physical coffee shops have the right metrics to attract venture capitalists. They recently closed on a $20 million Series B round in a year where fundraising has taken a nosedive — even for companies with low overhead costs. Rebecca has the story. Should you launch an AI startup?: It seems like it’s the best of times for founders thinking about launching an AI startup, especially with OpenAI releasing ChatGPT to the masses. But it could be the opposite, depending on which investors you ask. Ron tries to get to the bottom of it."
128,Investors cheer as Coinbase beats Q1 expectations,['@alex'],"May 4, 2023","Today after the bell, Coinbase reported its Q1 2023 financial results, handily beating expectations. In the first three months of the year, the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange generated net revenues of $736 million, a $79 million net loss and adjusted EBITDA of $284 million. Analysts had expected a far slimmer $655 million in revenue and a larger loss from the company in the first quarter. In after-hours trading, shares of Coinbase are up a little more than 7%. Certainly, Coinbase’s results are a welcome dataset for both crypto bulls and investors in the company alike. Let’s explore how Coinbase beat analyst estimates, and what it is forecasting for the coming quarter. Can the company keep up its return to adjusted profitability? What does it say concerning Q2 crypto trading activity? If we compare Coinbase’s Q1 2023 results to its year-ago totals, we are presented with an odd set of numbers. Yes, Coinbase’s revenue in Q1 2022 was far greater ($1.17 billion) than what it posted in its most recent quarter. In contrast, however, in the year-ago period, the company’s net loss was far greater ($430 million) and its adjusted EBITDA far smaller ($20 million). "
129,Mozart Data announces free tier to encourage smaller businesses to get on platform,['@ron_miller'],"April 5, 2023","Mozart Data came out of the Summer 2020 Y Combinator cohort with an idea to provide a data stack in a box for companies. Since then, it has raised $19 million and attracted 100 customers, but the founders recognize that to attract new users to the platform, especially in today’s economic environment, might take some creativity. Today, the company announced Mozart Sonata, a free tier (and fun play on words), meant to help companies get comfortable with the platform and perhaps eventually grow into the pay versions of the product, Peter Fishman, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. “We wanted to get people using our data infrastructure earlier and earlier, and so we tailored a solution for those companies, who might be facing more extreme economic headwinds,” Fishman said. The company offers a number of services involved in processing data, including extracting the data from a variety of sources, placing it in a data warehouse, Mozart’s or Snowflake, and then putting that data to work in dashboards, charts and alerts. The idea is to provide all these services for the customer from a single vendor. The approach appears to be working. The startup doubled the number of customers using the platform since last year’s $15 million Series A funding announcement, but the founders wanted to get more people involved. The freemium model builds a natural top of funnel for the product, while making it accessible to a group of potential users, who might not be far enough along to pay for a solution. “It’s certainly the case that we’ve always liked the land and expand idea, and this is just sort of the extreme of that idea where [we] can bet on the product being so great that [we] can actually not just sell it initially for a small contract and grow that contract, but offer a free tier and have a number of those people convert into paying customers [eventually],” Fishman said. As company co-founder and CTO Dan Silberman pointed out, this is a way to see how the product works to connect to data sources and build tooling around that data. “In practice, that means you can usually get like one executive dashboard, or a little bit of data alerting on your data in Salesforce or something like that,” Silberman said. Once you see the value and you want to explore more, you would need to move to one of the pay tiers. “And then when you see that’s providing you value, and now you want these other dashboards or you want to add these other data sources, then you might start bumping up against the limits of the free plan,” he said. Mozart Sonata is available starting today. Mozart Data launched in 2020 and today has 100 customers and 25 employees."

It’s looking like a wet dress is likely next week, and if all goes to plan, we could see SpaceX attempt a flight as soon as the week after. In this issue: Virgin Orbit, the low Earth orbit small-payload launch company that was spun out of Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, has filed for bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bankruptcy filing follows weeks of bad news for the company, including a pause on all operations, a brief hunt for more money to continue as a going concern and massive layoffs to try to right-size to the company’s actual available budget, which the bankruptcy news essentially confirms was nonexistent. RIP. Image Credits: Virgin Orbit/Greg Robinson Image Credits: Virgin Orbit/Greg Robinson As tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate, a new startup has emerged from stealth with millions raised and a plan to send intelligence-gathering pursuit satellites to orbit this year. Colorado-based True Anomaly was founded last year by a trio of ex-Space Force members. The company has set out to supply the Pentagon with defensive tech to protect American assets in space, and to conduct recon on enemy spacecraft. The startup has developed a technology stack that includes training software and “autonomous orbital pursuit vehicles” that will be able to collect video and other data on objects in space. According to True Anomaly CEO Even Rogers, there is a critical “information asymmetry” between the U.S. and its adversaries regarding space activities.

Facing a tangle of state and federal legislation, inadequate compliance can quickly generate regulatory hassles and undermine customer confidence. In a TC+ post written by three lawyers from law firm Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP, the authors share basic information relevant for any crypto startups that operate in the U.S.. “By establishing a robust, risk-based compliance function … and staying abreast of the latest regulatory guidance, cryptocurrency companies can better position themselves to weather the crypto winter,” they write.

132,"The cultivated meat industry’s known struggles will take time to sort out, and maybe that’s OK",['@christinemhall'],"April 30, 2023","The Wall Street Journal went under the hood of the lab-grown meat industry, also known as cultivated or cell-cultured meat, and the struggles within. The Journal particularly homed in on what’s going on at UPSIDE Foods, which received a blessing from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration related to its process for making cultivated chicken, essentially saying it was safe to eat and making it the first company to receive this approval. Eat Just, which has been selling its product in Singapore, the first nation to approve the sale of cultivated meat, followed, getting its “thumbs-up” from the FDA in March. WSJ’s story pays particular attention to UPSIDE Foods’ success at making small batches of its chicken product, as well as its lack of being able to produce large amounts of product at a low cost, or at even price parity with traditional meat — and to be fair, most cultivated meat companies struggle with this too. “Initially our chicken will be sold at a price premium,” UPSIDE founder and CEO Uma Valeti told TechCrunch in November. “As we scale, we expect to eventually reach price parity with conventionally produced meat. Our goal is to ultimately be more affordable than conventionally produced meat.”   Companies in this sector make meat from animal cells that are fed growth factors. The production and pricing challenges presented in the WSJ story, however, are not new. “Is cell-culture meat ready for prime time?” wasn’t just a clever TechCrunch+ headline, but a legitimate question posed in early 2022 that still really hasn’t been answered. Most cultivated meat stories in our archives include at least a sentence about how hard it is for companies to produce mass quantities and to create foods by this method so that the finished product is under $10 a pound."
133,"Yep, ‘Learning Man’ is becoming a thing ",['@nmasc_'],"April 15, 2023","Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior reporter Natasha Mascarenhas.  After a Tahoe-based tech conference, Sheel Mohnot, the fintech investor behind Better Tomorrow Ventures, is beatboxing in his head — all day, every day. And while it may feel like an uncommon takeaway from an event featuring the who’s who in tech that was precisely the point. Mohnot is one of the 40 people who attended “Learning Man” earlier this month, a tech conference focused on immersing attendees in education, play and creation. Attendees were in their 20s to 60s; in exchange for expanding their mind, tickets cost $750. The event, organized by friends Marie Diamond, Arielle Zuckerberg, Amit Kumar, Jared Goldberg and Kristen Winzent, wanted to ironically dig beyond what brought everyone together in the first place: the world of tech. Diamond, a comms executive and organizer, told TechCrunch that “the whole premise of the conference is that work is often the least interesting thing about us and we wanted to provide a space for people to go deeper.”  The main rule? Bring a topic that you want to teach others about. The main principles? Stuff like “Beginners are sexy” and “The world is a passion project.” Company merchandise is encouraged — as long as it’s not your own (a rule which one person correctly interpreted as a chance to rock an FTX risk management shirt). Participants collectively held over 30 presentations, talking about everything from travel hacks to fertility 101 to date night planning. That said, artificial intelligence did make an appearance in at least two sessions, even a few hundred miles from what has been dubbed Cerebral Valley. And, beatboxing aside, Mohnot did manage take away a professional learning from the time management presentation: hire another EA. As a result of the event, not-so-jokingly there was some sponsor interest. I joked with  that they may have accidentally created a community-focused tech startup. But Diamond says that they’re specifically not trying to make money off the event. “I think it would change the nature of it, it was a small key experiment and I think we want to keep the authenticity of it.” She adds, laughing, “if there’s any sponsorship, it would be from Sheel and Taco Bell.” (Mohnot got married to his wife last month in the Taco Bell metaverse). Zuckerberg, a co-organizer, part-time DJ and investor at Long Journey VC, says that they’re thinking of making it an annual event. Community members who attended the debut conference are cooking up mini “Learning Man Dinners.” “We actually barely talked about work and it was delightful,” Zuckerberg said.

Amazon is finally jumping into the generative AI race, but not in the way you’d expect. Unlike Microsoft and Apple, which both have sought to build AI models in-house, Amazon is recruiting third parties to host models on AWS. The effort is called Amazon Bedrock, and startups are given the ability to build generative AI-powered apps via pretrained models from startups, including AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Stability AI. It is currently in limited preview. Here’s why we’re not surprised: I mean, we’ve been waiting for this. Amazon has seemingly been dancing around the AI conversation compared to the bold moves of some of its competitors. Before Bedrock, Amazon’s interest was best seen through a partnership with Stability AI, and even more recently, an accelerator for generative AI startups. Image Credits: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images Image Credits: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images Some venture capital firms are doling out surprising advice these days: raise capital from our firm, but don’t pay yourself. In other words, if you’re a founder with true ambition, your salary is in equity, rooted in the future success of your startup. Well, TC’s Haje Jan Kamps doesn’t love that, writing: “If you’ve raised venture capital, you have to pay yourself.”  I don’t disagree. But here’s what Haje said: But you know what is one of the biggest distractions? Not being able to afford your mortgage, rent, car payment or next shipment of Huel. As a founder, it is your duty to focus on building the startup so it is as successful as it can be as quickly as possible. As an investor in these startups, it’s your duty to help the startup get to that point in the shortest possible amount of time. Telling founders not to take a salary is wonderfully counterproductive on so many levels.

Pioneer Mind’s Naveed Lalani, psychiatrist Dr. Saumya Dave and Graham & Walker’s Leslie Feinzaig all said different versions of the same statement: founders shouldn’t have to choose between mental health and grit.  Here’s what to know: This episode is full of perspectives on how to hustle responsibly, ranging from a call to action for investors to support founders in looking at their mental health as a business priority to the fragmented world of “mental health support.” Give it a listen.

134,ChatGPT resumes service in Italy after adding privacy disclosures and controls,['@riptari'],"April 28, 2023","A few days after OpenAI announced a set of privacy controls for its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, the service has been made available again to users in Italy — resolving (for now) an early regulatory suspension in one of the European Union’s 27 Member States, even as a local probe of its compliance with the region’s data protection rules continues. At the time of writing, web users browsing to ChatGPT from an Italian IP address are no longer greeted by a notification instructing them the service is “disabled for users in Italy”. Instead they are met by a note saying OpenAI is “pleased to resume offering ChatGPT in Italy”. The pop-up goes on to stipulate that users must confirm they are 18+ or 13+ with consent from a parent or guardian to use the service — by clicking on a button stating “I meet OpenAI’s age requirements”. The text of the notification also draws attention to OpenAI’s Privacy Policy and links to a help center article where the company says it provides information about “how we develop and train ChatGPT”. The changes in how OpenAI presents ChatGPT to users in Italy are intended to satisfy an initial set of conditions set by the local data protection authority (DPA) in order for it to resume service with managed regulatory risk. Quick recap of the backstory here: Late last month, Italy’s Garante ordered a temporary stop-processing order on ChatGPT, saying it was concerned the services breaches EU data protection laws. It also opened an investigation into the suspected breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). OpenAI quickly responded to the intervention by geoblocking users with Italian IP addresses at the start of this month. The move was followed, a couple of weeks later, by the Garante issuing a list of measures it said OpenAI must implement in order to have the suspension order lifted by the end of April — including adding age-gating to prevent minors from accessing the service and amending the legal basis claimed for processing local users’ data. The regulator faced some political flak in Italy and elsewhere in Europe for the intervention. Although it’s not the only data protection authority raising concerns — and, earlier this month, the bloc’s regulators agreed to launch a task force focused on ChatGPT with the aim of supporting investigations and cooperation on any enforcements. In a press release issued today announcing the service resumption in Italy, the Garante said OpenAI sent it a letter detailing the measures implemented in response to the earlier order — writing: “OpenAI explained that it had expanded the information to European users and non-users, that it had amended and clarified several mechanisms and deployed amenable solutions to enable users and non-users to exercise their rights. Based on these improvements, OpenAI reinstated access to ChatGPT for Italian users.” Expanding on the steps taken by OpenAI in more detail, the DPA says OpenAI expanded its privacy policy and provided users and non-users with more information about the personal data being processed for training its algorithms, including stipulating that everyone has the right to opt out of such processing — which suggests the company is now relying on a claim of legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing data for training its algorithms (since that basis requires it to offer an opt out). Additionally, the Garante reveals that OpenAI has taken steps to provide a way for Europeans to ask for their data not to be used to train the AI (requests can be made to it by an online form) — and to provide them with “mechanisms” to have their data deleted. It also told the regulator it is not able to fix the flaw of chatbots making up false information about named individuals at this point. Hence introducing “mechanisms to enable data subjects to obtain erasure of information that is considered inaccurate”. European users wanting to opt-out from the processing of their personal data for training its AI can also do so by a form OpenAI has made available which the DPA says will “thus to filter out their chats and chat history from the data used for training algorithms”. So the Italian DPA’s intervention has resulted in some notable changes to the level of control ChatGPT offers Europeans. That said, it’s not yet clear whether the tweaks OpenAI has rushed to implement will (or can) go far enough to resolve all the GDPR concerns being raised. For example, it is not clear whether Italians’ personal data that was used to train its GPT model historically, i.e. when it scraped public data off the Internet, was processed with a valid lawful basis — or, indeed, whether data used to train models previously will or can be deleted if users request their data deleted now. The big question remains what legal basis OpenAI had to process people’s information in the first place, back when the company was not being so open about what data it was using. The US company appears to be hoping to bound the objections being raised about what it’s been doing with Europeans’ information by providing some limited controls now, applied to new incoming personal data, in the hopes this fuzzes the wider issue of all the regional personal data processing it’s done historically. Asked about the changes it’s implemented, an OpenAI spokesperson emailed TechCrunch this summary statement: ChatGPT is available again to our users in Italy. We are excited to welcome them back, and we remain dedicated to protecting their privacy. We have addressed or clarified the issues raised by the Garante, including: A new help center article on how we collect and use training data. Greater visibility of our Privacy Policy on the OpenAI homepage and ChatGPT login page. Greater visibility of our user content opt-out form in help center articles and Privacy Policy. Continuing to offer our existing process for responding to privacy requests via email, as well as a new form for EU users to exercise their right to object to our use of personal data to train our models. A tool to verify users’ ages in Italy upon sign-up. We appreciate the Garante for being collaborative, and we look forward to ongoing constructive discussions. In the help center article OpenAI admits it processed personal data to train ChatGPT, while trying to claim that it didn’t really intent to do it but the stuff was just lying around out there on the Internet — or as it puts it: “A large amount of data on the internet relates to people, so our training information does incidentally include personal information. We don’t actively seek out personal information to train our models.” Which reads like a nice try to dodge GDPR’s requirement that it has a valid legal basis to process this personal data it happened to find. OpenAI expands further on its defence in a section (affirmatively) entitled “how does the development of ChatGPT comply with privacy laws?” — in which it suggests it has used people’s data lawfully because A) it intended its chatbot to be beneficial; B) it had no choice as lots of data was required to build the AI tech; and C) it claims it did not mean to negatively impact individuals. “For these reasons, we base our collection and use of personal information that is included in training information on legitimate interests according to privacy laws like the GDPR,” it also writes, adding: “To fulfill our compliance obligations, we have also completed a data protection impact assessment to help ensure we are collecting and using this information legally and responsibly.” So, again, OpenAI’s defence to an accusation of data protection law-breaking essentially boils down to: ‘But we didn’t mean anything bad officer!’ Its explainer also offers some bolded text to emphasize a claim that it’s not using this data to build profiles about individuals; contact them or advertise to them; or try to sell them anything. None of which is relevant to the question of whether its data processing activities have breached the GDPR or not. The Italian DPA confirmed to us that its investigation of that salient issue continues. In its update, the Garante also notes that it expects OpenAI to comply with additional requests laid down in its April 11 order — flagging the requirement for it to implement an age verification system (to more robustly prevent minors accessing the service); and to conduct a local information campaign to inform Italians of how it’s been processing their data and their right to opt-out from the processing of their personal data for training its algorithms. “The Italian SA [supervisory authority] acknowledges the steps forward made by OpenAI to reconcile technological advancements with respect for the rights of individuals and it hopes that the company will continue in its efforts to comply with European data protection legislation,” it adds, before underlining that this is just the first pass in this regulatory dance. Ergo, all OpenAI’s various claims to be 100% bona fide remain to be robustly tested.  "
135,Warner Bros. gives DC fans an official ‘Blue Beetle’ trailer,['@laurenforristal'],"April 3, 2023","Warner Bros. is giving DC fans a “Blue Beetle” movie, set to hit theaters on August 18. The trailer was released today, providing a glimpse into the world of the bug-legged superhero. “Blue Beetle” stars “Cobra Kai” actor Xolo Maridueña as Jamie Reyes, a recent college graduate who gets his Iron Man-style powers from an ancient relic of alien technology created by an alien race called the Reach. The sentient device calls itself Khaji Da and looks like a blue, metal scarab — a giant dung beetle from the eastern Mediterranean area. The scarab chooses Reyes to be its host and permanently attaches itself to him, giving him a powerful suit of armor. Fans have long awaited a glimpse of the upcoming film after the concept of the alien battle suit was revealed at DC FanDome in 2021. In May 2022, pictures and videos of Maridueña wearing the costume surfaced on the internet. While the movie was initially going to premiere exclusively on HBO Max, the company announced in December 2021 that it was skipping the streaming service and going straight to theaters. “Blue Beetle” is DC’s first-ever Latino superhero getting his own film, so giving it time to shine on the big screen is a significant move."
136,TikTok considers ditching its ‘Friends’ tab for a new ‘Explore’ experience focused on discovery,['@sarahintampa'],"April 11, 2023","Unlike Facebook, TikTok grew in popularity by connecting users with their interests, not their real-life friends and family. In fact, many people today deny the app’s request to upload their contacts because TikTok is a place where they don’t want to interact with people they know. That’s why the company’s decision last year to replace its useful Discover section with a dedicated Friends tab wasn’t all that well-received. Now, it seems TikTok is reconsidering that change. The company confirmed it’s running a test that swaps out its Friends tab — which is also where TikTok’s BeReal clone is found — with a new experience that’s more akin to Instagram’s Explore page. The change, if rolled out more broadly, could signal the company’s acceptance of the role TikTok plays in the social app ecosystem — one that’s about content discovery, not keeping up with real-world friendships. TikTok alluded to this mission when it recently launched its new STEM-focused feed in the app, noting that “discovery is essential to the TikTok experience,” and that it’s always looking to help the community uncover “new and relevant content.” The company also earlier this year began an experiment that introduced a major change to the app’s homepage where it expanded beyond its two main feeds, For You and Following, to also include dedicated feeds focused on areas like sports, fashion, gaming and food. Both cases, however, signal the discovery challenges TikTok is now trying to overcome because of the Discover tab’s removal. For people who didn’t open TikTok daily, the Discover tab had been a means of catching up with what people were talking about and creating content around over the past several days. In the tab, users could watch trending videos, organized by hashtag, find new creators to follow and view some of the most viral videos. It also offered space for TikTok to promote various themes it wanted to touch on that week or month through larger, eye-catching banners at the top of the page. With the tab’s disappearance, it’s become much harder to keep up with the latest on TikTok, which leads to increased viewership of creator series where they would summarize TikTok trends in weekly videos. While TikTok’s new Explore tab may not offer the same overview that Discover once did, it does seem to be a new way for the app to suggest content to end users outside of its usual feeds. Image Credits: TikTok screenshot via Watchful.ai Image Credits: TikTok screenshot via Watchful.ai The feature, which was uncovered by the product intelligence firm Watchful.ai, introduces a page where users can scroll and explore videos in a grid form. It’s unclear for the time being how Explore’s recommendations will work or how directly they’ll be tied to users’ viewing behavior, but ultimately, it could serve as another way to surface new content — and potentially, become a platform for ads, like Instagram Explore. TikTok confirmed the test of the Explore Feed experience was in early testing in a few regions globally with select users, but was not yet widely available. Currently, the TikTok Now/Friends tab is still the default experience for all users. Image Credits: TikTok screenshot via Watchful.ai Image Credits: TikTok screenshot via Watchful.ai In its current form, TikTok Explore is less visually appealing than Instagram Explore. The latter presents a colorful, wall-to-wall grid of both photos and videos the app believes the user will like, based on their prior behavior. It doesn’t include white space and text, as TikTok Explore’s test does. TikTok’s design also limits the amount of content that can be shown on the screen. While Instagram can feature a dozen or so photos and videos on Explore, TikTok Explore only manages to fit four. Of course, as an early-stage test, this may not be the final experience — and the feature itself may never reach the point of rolling out to the public at all. That will depend on how users choose to engage with Explore and if it generates the metrics TikTok wants to see. It does, however, signal that TikTok is at least thinking about taking a step back from trying to be a more traditional social network that prioritizes connecting people with others they know. It could also mean a wind-down for TikTok Now, as it would no longer have prime home screen real estate in the dedicated Friends tab. Launched last fall amid numerous other BeReal clones, TikTok Now was a shameless attempt to turn BeReal’s once-a-day photos into just another feature for a larger social app. But demand for BeReal has been trending down, with a decline in downloads from 15.2 million in October 2022 to 4.2 million this February, according to data from Apptopia recently cited by Digiday. That could prompt TikTok to find a better use case for this prominent tab on its app — and one that would provide a new surface for discovery and, eventually perhaps, advertising."
137,"After chargeback fraud debacle, Union54 CEO says fintech in Africa ‘isn’t child’s play’",['@ulonnaya'],"March 29, 2023","Last July, TechCrunch reported that customers of several fintech apps couldn’t access the virtual dollar card services that these platforms provided. In addition, customers couldn’t create new cards, fund existing ones, or make online and in-store payments and purchases with them. At the heart of this issue was chargeback fraud that Zambian startup Union54 was battling. The YC-backed startup’s API allows companies to issue physical and virtual local and dollar debit cards to their customers and employees without needing a bank or a third-party processor, and it served as the default card partner to 100 fintechs serving the region. Halting its services affected many startups for several weeks before they found alternatives. The event, more than ever, spotlighted the need for better KYC/AML compliance checks in the card-issuing space (and in fintech in general), as inconsistent due diligence for cardholder chargeback claims could invoke more fraudulent activities.  Union54, which has raised over $15 million from global investors, including Tiger Global, was an official Mastercard issuer. At the time, it underwent a compliance audit and expected to get its platform up and running in two months at best. However, it hasn’t yet. Instead, it is biding its time before it re-enters Africa’s fintech market, where it intends to apply what it has learned from the event and its current nine-month hiatus, its co-founder and CEO Perseus Mlambo told TechCrunch recently. Mlambo spoke candidly about the issues Union54 had to contend with, how the company was at risk of a total shutdown, and why fintechs need to be more transparent about fraud exposure. Excerpts from the conversation below have been lightly edited for length and clarity. TC: It’s no news that Union54 suffered from chargeback fraud. However, no detailed explanation has been provided. Can you share what happened? Mlambo: A few days before the article went live, we noticed a lot of fraud being attempted on our platform, which we detected and stopped. What people were trying to do was effectively use funds that they didn’t have. Just to give you an idea of the amount of fraud that we stopped, they were trying to use the cards for over $1.2 billion of attempted fraud. We did the numbers; this volume was 600 times larger than our typical daily volume. So we provide API access to fintechs and they give card access to their customers. One of the companies we were working with was operating in a new region on the continent, and because of the way they had configured things on their end, they were vulnerable to this attempted fraud. What we saw was that people were trying to buy one specific crypto on a particular cryptocurrency website. So that’s kind of maybe a little bit easy to identify quite quickly that this was very unusual. How did Union54 tackle this issue with this company? We’ve got several customers and one of the things that we do is to work with them and let them know that these things are also affecting them. So what we did with that company was bring it to their attention and say, “Hey, we’re seeing a lot of volume coming from your end. We highly recommend that you take a look.” At first, they were adamant that this was normal and a part of growth; they were even shocked that we were surprised by the volumes coming in. But after a few hours, they said, “You know what? Something is wrong.” Ultimately, what ended up happening was that as the cards were being used, we were declining them. We would see a transaction coming through and say there is no corresponding balance for this transaction, so we stopped it. And because we kept stopping all of these transactions, it led to a degradation of our overall product, because merchants like Netflix, Google or Spotify would also write to us asking us why we were stopping all of these transactions, as it affected business.   It got so bad that we just kept denying every transaction during that period using our automated rules, users kept re-attempting these transactions, which lengthened the process of stopping this fraud. So Union54 stopped all transactions, including from people who wanted to buy stuff from these international websites, because they occurred during the fraud incident? Yeah, and that led to another complication, which I think we were maybe one of a few companies to experience. So every time a transaction is stopped or declined by our rules or system, we still have to pay for that transaction, because there are so many different parties involved in the lifeline of a transaction and we need to pay our suppliers. To give you an idea, we had invoices coming up to half-a-million dollars from canceled transactions at the peak of this activity.   We took the view that maybe one of three things was going to happen. Either we would spend all of our operational funds paying for these fees and then run out of money, which is not good because our fundamental rule is to stay alive. Or that we would go back to these affected fintechs and say, “Hey, you owe us half-a-million dollars,” knowing full well that they don’t have half a million dollars. Or we would say, “You know what, we’ll be able to recoup this from our suppliers to get these refunds later on when we appeal.” At the end of the day, we chose the third [option] and had to pay for these declined transactions with our funds. Afterward, we told our investors that we didn’t think it wise to continue operating the product until we solved all these issues.  In retrospect, couldn’t Union54 have booted out the company (ies) causing this fraud? So we tried that. But what was happening, and another thing that we learned, was that as soon as we kicked off this company, the attackers attempting this fraud would figure out that we were enabling another fintech to issue cards and would try to go through them. It was quite a sophisticated attempt, and kicking off one fintech wouldn’t have ultimately helped because this constantly happens with even global fintechs. I think it’s time we start having that conversation in Africa. Fintech in Africa is hard, and most stakeholders still pretend this is child’s play. They’re not talking about the real issues. And I think by coming out and saying, “You know what, we detected fraud and we stopped it,” it just gives confidence to other people as well because these things happen all the time. It’s a bold move to come out and share what you’ve learned because most African founders typically don’t like to talk about failures or, in this case, setbacks.  Honestly, when you’re going through it, it feels like the world is falling apart, because you build something and then suddenly, you’re losing control and people start spreading rumors. It’s also a bit of a wet blanket when the market you live and operate in is dragged through the mud. I feel like that’s why many people don’t talk about these issues because they feel like it’d be doing a disservice to the whole ecosystem. That’s one of the reasons why we didn’t say anything at first. We also didn’t refute anything when the allegations came out because it meant that for some of our customers, it was a very life-and-death situation, where, if we said anything, they would have to contend with whatever we said. So we just observed our legal obligations, did right by our shareholders, and then continued to build our new product, which can give us sustainability.  Regarding the new product, sources told me late last year that Union54 was working with a few customers in stealth. What was the outcome of that process? Since we work with card schemes, during that period we were switching access to the API for about three fintechs to measure and make a case for us to get specific refunds from one of our suppliers. For us to be able to get that data, we needed to prove effectively, like a baseline, reopen access to the product and say, “On a normal day, this is what the chargebacks look like, and this is what transactions look like, and this is the impact of the fraud that we had seen.”   By having those comparison points, we’re then able to go back to our supplier and say, “Look, we want ultimately to develop a company that can help anybody anywhere in Africa issue cards, and these are some of the things that we have learned.” For instance, we were able to determine that it was inflexible to work with bigger companies because they take longer to settle disputes. Also, we figured we needed to address our KYC processes.  The scale at which Union54 was operating was fascinating, because we would find fintechs in each country and give them access to the API, as they are regulated in that country and would do KYC themselves. And because of that, we were able to onboard over 100 companies and create solutions that work in Ethiopia, which was at the time opening up, as well as Zambia, a unique market where ID documents are laminated and you can’t easily scan them using a phone camera. Still, we needed to be able to serve clients all around, which affected us in the long run. Some fantastic companies have emerged in the KYC space, but they mainly operate or serve a niche geography. The last time we checked, there’s yet to be a company that can provide Cape-to-Cairo coverage of KYC databases. Hopefully, by the end of next year, we’ll have somebody who can do that. That would be a game changer.  We’ve also got maybe two or three companies issuing U.S. dollar virtual cards. But there are still complaints about their services, showing that a Union54 with better KYC processes is still needed, because the issues haven’t gone away. The utility of Union54 is just getting much broader and people are still emailing us to ask when we’ll start issuing again. Is there an answer to that? We’ve grieved over the last few months because losing something is never easy. But then after that, we took heart knowing that we’re still well-funded and we’ve had the time to develop something that can last whatever shock is happening currently in the ecosystem. For us to be able to issue again, we’ve made several adjustments there that we will launch with our next product.  Meanwhile, one of the other things that we learned is that despite all of the layoffs and devaluation news coming out, the fintech scene in Africa is still vibrant and there are a lot of good products being developed and lots of great companies. Still, it will take some time before we have a mature ecosystem."

139,Maxar completes $6.4B sale to private equity,['@breadfrom'],"May 3, 2023","Maxar Technologies, the satellite imaging and manufacturing company, has completed its $6.4 billion sale to private equity. The company announced on Wednesday that it was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange following the closing of the acquisition by PE firm Advent International and minority investor British Columbia Investment Management Corporation. It will shortly be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange. The entities announced their merger agreement in December, stipulating that outstanding Maxar shares would be acquired for $53 per share in an all-cash deal. The Westminster, Colorado-based space company is the result of a 2017 merger between DigitalGlobe and MDA Holdings Company. The company later sold MDA’s assets for $1 billion CAD ($765 million). Maxar has had a series of highs and lows since then; it concluded 2018 with a $1.26 billion loss due to a bottomed-out stock price, in part due to the loss of a major imaging satellite. But since then, the company has steadily recovered its stock price, ending 2022 with an estimated $2 billion in revenue. The company has scored major contracts from the U.S. government and defense, including a $3.2 billion contract from the National Reconnaissance Office last year. More recently, Maxar landed a contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency worth up to $192 million over five years."
140,"New Twitter API tiers still miss the mark, developers say",['@indianidle'],"March 30, 2023","A number of Twitter developers are expressing their disappointment with Twitter’s new API structure after recently announced changes that some say will still not meet their needs. On Wednesday evening, Twitter revealed its new API pricing plans, weeks after initially announcing its plan to shut down its free API. Now, there will be three new tiers for developers: a “Free” tier with 1,500 tweets per month, a $100 per month “Basic” tier with expanded access and an “Enterprise” tier that reportedly costs $42,000 per month. For many developers, the first two levels may not be sufficient and the enterprise level is too expensive. After the announcement, a lot of developers are worried that they have to either shut down their projects or pivot to providing services focused on another social network. One area of impact could be Twitter’s bots. The new free API tier would allow an automated account to post 1,500 times a month. That’s roughly one tweet an hour and it could be useful for only some bot accounts. The Basic tier, which costs $100 per month, gives developers access to 10,000 read requests and 50,000 post requests. However, there is a cap of 3,000 posts per account per month. For interactive bots like the one that summarizes threads or replies to people with a picture, this limit is not sufficient. The only option for these developers remains enterprise-level access, which is out of reach for smaller businesses. By comparison, older access levels provided developers with 500,000 tweets per month for Twitter’s “Essential” level and 2 million tweets per month for the “Elevated” level. The rate limits (archived page) were also higher within a 15-minute window. For example, the older API allowed apps to post 200 tweets per user per app in 15 minutes. The new API allows only 100 tweets per user in 24 hours. This essentially kills many use cases. As a result of the changes, developer Luca Hammer said on Twitter he will shut down his stat app @accountanalysis. He also mentioned that he is trying to find new ways to keep Fedifinder — a service that lets you search for your Twitter friends on the Fediverse — active by way of crowdfunding and caching account-level requests. Because of the changes to the Twitter API, https://t.co/91atG08ilh is shutting down at the end of April 2023. All paid subscriptions have been cancelled. User data that does not need to be kept for legal reasons (eg. invoices) will get deleted in May.https://t.co/FHplViwi6l pic.twitter.com/t2mnOu2ydw — accountanalysis (@accountanalysis) March 30, 2023  Travis Fischer, the developer of ChatGPTbot, which lets people use ChatGPT on Twitter, said that he will also have to shut down his bot. He told TechCrunch he was ready to pay for access, but having a limit of 3,000 tweet posts per month per account would make his tool useless. Fischer — along with other developers in the past — also expressed concerns that some developers will move to unofficial APIs or browser automation to scrape Twitter data. The developer behind a video translator bot, Alex Volkov, told TechCrunch he will have to shut down the service that he believes is useful. He also runs a tool called Targum video, which helps people translate videos from any social network. He mentioned that a lot of the tool’s usage comes from Twitter, and now he will need to switch to other social networks to use and market the service. Other useful projects like #buildinpublic, which allowed developers to show off their work, or Mailclipperhq, which sent users a weekly email about their bookmarks, will also shut down, the projects announced on Twitter.

I was willing to pay $100/month for the Twitter API But, that's only 10,000 tweets which can't support Tweet HP This might be the end of the road 😢 pic.twitter.com/P9rYLKbLIW — Remote Joe (@remotejoeclark) March 29, 2023  Apart from developers, researchers and academics are also worried about the future of their projects. Twitter has said that it is “looking at new ways” to cater to the community, but until then they have to rely on these existing tiers. Maura Conway, a professor of cyber threats at Swansea University, said that Twitter’s move is “an absolute travesty from a researcher perspective” and different study areas like online hate, extremism and misinformation will be “badly affected.” Carl Miller, co-founder of a digital think tank called Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at Demos, said that there should be questions in the parliament about how Twitter’s steps would impact areas like information warfare and electoral integrity. This is an absolute travesty from a researcher perspective. Online hate and extremism research, also misinfo and disinfo, will be particularly badly affected, to the detriment of policymakers and publics. Potentially even democracy itself. https://t.co/qmn9OoXOkD — Maura Conway (@galwaygrrl) March 30, 2023  Care about stopping hate speech? Or stemming information warfare? Countering extremism? Electoral integrity? This single move is going to remove a vast chunk of social media research that informs all of that. There should be questions in Parliament about this. https://t.co/4IyYb63Bfu — Carl Miller (@carljackmiller) March 30, 2023  For research, the free API is practically useless and students might not have any money to spend on projects. Plus, research projects usually need substantial data access, which is not available under current plans. As researchers have pointed out previously, the new API access levels will be a hindrance to projects aiming to provide important information during an emergency like a natural calamity. Elon Musk’s latest move is a money grab to bolster the company’s revenue. The message is clear: if you want to develop any tool around Twitter for a large audience, pay for enterprise access. The Tesla CEO has already slashed the company’s staff multiple times to save costs. The relaunched Twitter Blue subscription is not doing great. Analytics suggests that it has brought in just $11 million on mobile to date. Twitter had already alienated the developer community by shutting down multiple projects and then blocking popular third-party clients. With this new move, the company driving people who develop tools to make the platform better away from Twitter. The company had a chance to introduce a middle tier between basic and enterprise to get indie app makers to sign up and earn revenue from them. By providing developers with extreme choices, Musk & co. will have most of them abandon their Twitter-related projects. Many users are unhappy with alternative Twitter clients going away. With more apps and creative bots being shut down, the quality of Twitter’s service will dip further.  "
141,Adthos uses generative AI to completely automate audio ads,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 5, 2023","As generative AI proliferates, it’s beginning to reach the ads we hear on podcasts and the radio. Startup Adthos this week launched a platform that uses AI to generate scripts for audio ads — and even add voiceovers, sound effects and music. Customers can optionally go in and edit the ads using a browser-based, multi-track editor, yielding a “fully produced” ad that can be played out via integrations with radio automation systems and ad servers. Adthos CEO Raoul Wedel pitches the platform as a way for advertisers to “efficiently self-service” and “instantly” produce high-audio ads — and for publishers to “support long-tail revenue streams” by creating self-service ad-buying platforms. “The real game changer is that a small advertiser can run a great-quality ad in a minute or two,” Wedel said, pointing out the potential for localization and personalization. But the platform — like many embracing generative AI tech — raises ethical questions. Adthos’ platform is made up of a mix of in-house tech and third-party APIs. To generate ad scripts, Adthos leverages OpenAI’s recently released GPT-4 text-producing model. And on the voice side, Adthos compiled a library of hundreds of synthetic voices, including — according to Wedel — “Emmy Award-winning” voice actors and talents. Wedel says that the voice actors are “fully aware” of the platform and paid either a flat fee or a licensing fee for the use of their voice, based on their preferences. “Adthos has already paid out hundreds of thousands in royalties to voice actors,” he added. But what’s unclear is whether all of those voice actors chose to be included in Adthos’ library in the first place. Recently, Vice reported that actors are being asked to sign away rights to their voices so that clients can use AI to generate synthetic versions that could eventually replace them. The contract language tends to be ambiguous, the voice actors say, with some actors reportedly being told that they can’t be hired without agreeing to clauses that give away the rights to use their voices for synthetic training. Image Credits: Adthos Image Credits: Adthos Wedel didn’t reveal the contractual terms of Adthos’ arrangements. But he reaffirmed that voice actors on the platform have signed consent and licensing agreements. “We use real-life voice actors for the training of synthetic voices. We train and select them based on our experience in markets and ad creation,” Wedel said. “We have created our own training datasets and recording software for the talent to record their voice.” Wedel added that actors are afforded some control over how their voices are used on the platform, like the choice to preclude them from use in certain ad categories, such as religious or political ads. Asked about what steps, if any, Adthos takes to moderate the content generated by its platform, Wedel said that it leaves the task of reviewing ads before they’re finalized and broadcast to customers and publishers. Generative AI, particularly text-generating AI, has a tendency to go off the rails. For example, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, has been found to make up facts and reinforce ethnic and gender stereotypes. If an Adthos customer was to totally automate the ad generation process, they might run the risk of producing toxic, offensive and ultimately harmful ads — an undesirable outcome for any brand, surely. Wedel notes that OpenAI performs some filtering at the API level. But — recognizing that this alone isn’t sufficient, perhaps — he says that Adthos plans to add content moderation “as the platform develops,” including rules about words or terms that can’t be used in ads. “It’s up to the publisher to have a human in the loop,” Wedel said. “But we have specific requirements, like disclosing the AI nature of the ads and only using voiceover talent with their consent.” In any case, Adthos claims to have several paying customers, including Dutch media conglomerate Talpa, and advertisers and agencies like GroupM, Dentsu and Sportradar. I asked Wedel point blank if he was concerned that Adthos’ platform could cost marketing and advertising agencies and companies jobs. He quoted Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who said it was a “conscious decision” to start conversations in society early about what’s coming where it concerns AI. “It will undoubtedly cause jobs to be lost. But the people that prepare and embrace AI will thrive and be more productive,” Wedel said. “The ones that don’t will be the ones losing jobs.”"
142,Here’s how to stream March Madness 2023,['@laurenforristal'],"April 5, 2023","We hope you’ve filled out your brackets by now because the madness is officially here. Last night kicked off NCAA Selection Sunday, where the full March Madness schedules were finalized for the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. Fans that want to watch all the men’s basketball games can subscribe to live TV streaming services that provide access to CBS, TBS, TNT or truTV. Meanwhile, the women’s tournament will be available on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPNU. DirecTV Stream, Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV provide access to all these networks. In terms of the men’s tournament, Sling TV subscribers can get the Blue plan, which carries TBS, TNT and truTV, but not CBS. It’s important to note that you need CBS if you want to watch the men’s Final Four and NCAA Championship games. FuboTV and Paramount+ Premium only have CBS and not TBS, TNT or truTV. For fans that want to livestream the women’s tournament, they can also check out FuboTV, which carries ABC, ESPN and ESPN2. However, you need to pay an additional $8 a month for the Fubo Extra add-on to get ESPNews and ESPNU. DirecTV Stream also charges more for these two channels. Viewers can also stream all tournaments on NCAA’s March Madness Live website or app. However, if you don’t provide a TV provider, then you only get a three-hour preview. March Madness Live recently launched a multiview streaming option on the web, which allows viewers to watch up to four games simultaneously. Fans can also stream two games at the same time on connected TV devices. Image Credits: NCAA Image Credits: NCAA Image Credits: NCAA Image Credits: NCAA UConn 76, San Diego State 59 LSU 102, Iowa 85"
143,Upward and onward,['@bheater'],"April 28, 2023","The future is very much yet to be written about vertical farming. In many ways, the technology presents hope in the midst of rising food safety concerns, aging populations and potential environmental collapse. It’s also an intensely hard row to hoe, as it were. Early companies in the space are going to be the ones focused on driving down unit economics (hopefully) to a point where the technology makes sense from a price perspective. But sometimes being early to a party means you’re among the first to leave. Last January, we covered what looked to be an important next step for Upward Farms, as the company announced plans to open a 250,000-square-foot farm in Northeastern, Pennsylvania early this year. The Brooklyn-based firm recently announced, however, that it has closed up shop. “We found that vertical farming is almost infinitely complex — as we tackled challenges, new ones emerged,” founders Jason Green, Ben Silverman and Matt La Rosa said in an open letter. “Our team faced these challenges head on, humbly asking ourselves, ‘If not me, who, and if not now, when?’ ” Even in a thriving market, building this stuff is intensely difficult. After three years of economic and other challenges, one imagines that it becomes even harder to convince potential backers to stick out what is ultimately a long runway. The startup is closing up its decade-long project, but the founders point at some potential silver lining. “While Upward Farms is closing its doors,” they note, “a small portion of our team will continue working to unleash the magic of the microbiome. In the coming months, we’ll have more to share.” There are still plenty of big names in the space, including Bowery and AeroFarms. It probably shouldn’t be a big surprise that the herd is going to thin for a bit, until the path to success gets clearer. Meantime, perhaps the Upward team has valuable innovations it can share with a potential industry partner."
144,Former NBA star Rick Fox’s startup gets $12M pre-seed for concrete that removes CO2,['@tdechant'],"May 3, 2023","No doubt that Rick Fox has had plenty of emotional moments in his life. There was the birth of his children, of course, and as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers in the early 2000s, he won three NBA championships. But last week, it’s clear that his third act — that of a startup founder — is becoming one of those moments. “I’ve been a part of a lot of amazing journeys and industries, from entertainment to movies and TV. I’ve been on sets with Oscar-winning actors and directors, and I’ve been on championship NBA teams. There’s been nothing more rewarding for me in my life than to be a part of this team where we’re leaving something behind,” Fox told TechCrunch+. Fox’s new challenge isn’t just building Partanna, a startup, but one that can make a dent in climate change. For him, it’s personal. Like many of us, Fox was sitting at home early in the pandemic mulling the challenges that were facing the world. The Bahamas, where he grew up and now lives, wasn’t just in the midst of a pandemic. It was still reeling from the destruction wrought by Hurricane Dorian in 2019. “It got me to a point of thinking about a bigger crisis, which was one that we were facing at home in the Bahamas, which is the consistent impact of the climate and the storms that were happening on a yearly basis at a different level than what I grew up with.” Then he got a call from his manager, who had been displaced by the Woolsey Fires that swept through Malibu in 2018. In the recovery efforts, she ran into Sam Marshall, an architect who had been working on a new formulation for concrete for the last several years. “She called me up one day and she said, ‘Hey, you have to meet this gentleman. He’s been working on concrete that acts like a tree,’” Fox recalled. “And I’ll never forget that statement, because I had just stepped out of the shower and I was drying off, and I’m thinking to myself concrete that acts like a tree — how does that work? But then I also thought, if it does work, then it’s going to be on the forefront of changing how we build in the world.” Marshall had been working for years with other concrete experts, and the time was right to start a company. The two founded Partanna in 2021, and now the company is announcing $12 million in pre-seed funding from Cherubic Ventures, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. The company is valued at $190 million post-money, according to PitchBook data. "
145,AI is just someone else’s computer,['@carlypage_'],"May 3, 2023","Samsung this week became the latest big name to ban its employees from using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, warning staff that they could be fired if they’re caught using them. In an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, Samsung said the ban was prompted by the discovery of a leak of sensitive internal source code by an engineer who uploaded it to ChatGPT last month. According to earlier reports, one Samsung employee reportedly asked the chatbot to check sensitive database source code for errors, while another fed a recorded meeting into ChatGPT and asked it to generate minutes. The Korean tech giant is the latest company to crack down on the use of ChatGPT. American banking giant JPMorgan recently restricted its use among employees due to compliance concerns, and Amazon has reportedly urged staff not to share code with the AI chatbot. Verizon and Accenture have also taken similar steps, and Italy also briefly banned ChatGPT last month, saying it was concerned the services breached EU data protection laws. Even Microsoft, which has a multibillion-dollar stake in ChatGPT owner OpenAI, has doubts. According to a new report, Microsoft’s Azure cloud server unit plans to sell an alternative version of ChatGPT that runs on dedicated cloud servers, where the data will be kept separate from those of other customers. These concerns are by no means unfounded. Not only could tools such as ChatGPT help attackers write legitimate-sounding phishing emails and malicious code, they also carry a data breach risk. Those risks have already manifested: OpenAI admitted in March that ChatGPT has already suffered its first significant data breach, which exposed the personal and partial payment data of ChatGPT Plus subscribers. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT bring powerful capabilities to non-technical users and represent a huge leap forward both in what AI can do and its potential to revolutionize everything from the way we work to the way we make decisions. For non-technical users who are now using the technology to generate human-like text for essays and social media copy, it might feel like the future has arrived. Indeed, some have even called it a new industrial revolution. While it might feel like some sort of magical eight ball, the underlying infrastructure behind generative AI is nothing new. Much like a cloud storage service, all of the data you share with ChatGPT is stored on OpenAI’s servers. Along with prompts and chat conversations, OpenAI saves other data, too, such as your account details, approximate location, IP address, payment details and device information. This data is used to train and improve the model, according to OpenAI, so it can better understand and respond to natural language queries."
146,Chunk Foods close to opening factory to produce ‘millions’ of plant-based steaks,['@christinemhall'],"April 27, 2023","The global plant-based foods industry accounted for $8 billion in sales and received $1.2 billion in investment in 2022, according to new figures from the Good Food Institute. Those with recent funding include No Meat Factory, Planetarians, ISH Company and Chunk Foods, which is developing a plant-based alternative protein that mimics the texture and taste of traditional meat, initially steak, and eventually pork, lamb and poultry. Amos Golan, founder and CEO of Chunk Foods, told TechCrunch that while the plant-based market is around $8 billion, the traditional meat market is about $1.4 trillion, which means “we’re not even scratching the surface of the addressable market there.” He founded the company in 2020 while at MIT. Israel-based Chunk Foods took in $15 million in seed funding in November, which Golan said “is the biggest seed round ever for an Israeli plant-based company.” Fall Line Capital led the new investment and was joined by The MIT E14 fund and FootPrint Coalition. Chunk Foods previously raised $2 million in pre-seed funding.   The company develops whole cuts of alternative proteins using fermentation technology and food-grade microorganisms to turn soy and wheat into its proteins. And, yes, Chunk Foods does have some products in the pipeline without those two ingredients for consumers with allergies. Its steak product has no preservatives, additives, cholesterol or GMOs and has 25 grams of protein. Golan said what sets his company apart from other plant-based companies is that Chunk Foods’ proprietary fermentation technology has been able to mimic the texture, color and taste of traditional meat along with the direction and thickness of the fibers and juiciness of the cut. It is also doing this with a shorter and cleaner ingredient list, void of gums and stabilizers often used to thicken and preserve the shape of foods. Its technology has also helped the company bring its costs down to around $5 per steak, which Golan said is near the same price as traditional beef tenderloin. The “economies of scale are not fully there yet,” due to also having to import to the United States. Like other companies in this industry, Chunk Foods is in its early stages. It started its pilot phase in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is still pre-revenue, though its steak product is already being served in New York City restaurants, including Coletta, Anixi and The Butcher’s Daughter. Chunk Foods is deploying the new funds into a new facility in Israel, which Golan touts will be “one of the largest plant-based whole cuts factories in the world.” It is expected to be completed in June, and once it is, will be able to manufacture “millions of steaks” per year, Golan added. https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1.mp4 As mentioned, the company is not yet selling its products, but has closed on enough pre-sales that Golan said will keep the new facility busy initially for a couple of months. Funds will also be used to expand its current employee base of 25, with the R&D in Israel and commercial team in the U.S. There is also another, even larger, facility in the works as Chunk Foods eyes retail. Meanwhile, the plant-based meat alternative industry has gone through a roller coaster ride in the past year between layoffs at Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, both among the first generation of companies in the industry, production woes felt by Oatly and other setbacks. Addressing the speculation that the end of the plant-based alternative protein was near, Golan noted that what happened was that tens, if not hundreds, of companies came out with products in this area rapidly to grab a piece of the market, often with products that “were not good enough.” Even with its layoffs earlier this year, Golan pointed to Impossible as a company that has been able to grow rapidly as the plant-based market moved slowly. In 2023, Impossible launched four new products, including three plant-based “chicken” products and a leaner version of its “beef” product. “Some companies are not going to exist for very long,” Golan said. “They’re going to be either absorbed in other companies or they’re going to disappear. The third generation of plant-based companies are offering a better product and are leading the pack. Chunk is with them at the moment. Our products are more reasonably priced for the offering and we communicate better with our consumers.” If you have a juicy tip or lead about happenings in the venture world, you can reach Christine Hall at chall.techcrunch@gmail.com or Signal at 832-862-1051.

148,Review: Xbloom makes perfect pour-over so you don’t have to,['@Haje'],"March 31, 2023","Coffee nerds love the ceremony of making a good cup of coffee, but once you get advanced enough, things get really complex really fast. Making high-end pour-over coffee is a fine dance of grinding, pouring, temperature and patience, and it turns out that a lot of us just cannot be bothered with learning enough (or bringing enough science to the mix) to have great coffee every time. If you have $800, Xbloom is here to help with its one-touch bean-to-cup system. Each of the coffees in the company’s assortment needs a slightly different routine; different amounts of water, temperatures and different grind sizes. Each of the pods has an NFC chip built in, so it can tell the machine what it needs to do to prepare the coffee — or, using the app, you can fine-tune your preferred recipes. “The machine is able to have the coffee well expressed as the roaster intends. In this way, you can think about us as a hardware-enabled marketplace that we buy coffee for,” says Xbloom’s founder Richard Xu in an interview with TechCrunch. “We have only 2 million to 5 million people in the United States who are actually buying beans and preparing coffee from bean to cup themselves. There are 200 million people drinking coffee on a daily basis, so that’s a huge gap.”   The machine itself is a wonderfully over-engineered marvel. It looks like a modern art sculpture, and its sleek exterior hides a lot of clever tech. For example, the machine uses magnetism to bend the stream of water so it pours little circle shapes over the grounds, using the same principle as you may have seen in science class. It also uses extremely precise grinding and has a scale built in to measure the amount of water that gets poured over the grounds for every part of the cycle. I tried a prototype of the Xbloom for a couple of weeks, and there’s little doubt that the machine is capable of making extraordinarily fine and subtle coffees. The machine is easy to use, and it’s awesome that it self-configures based on whatever beans you feed it. Xbloom works with a number of roasters to make its coffee pods. The pods contain beans and double as the filter; the machine does all the grinding and pouring for you.

The pods contain beans and double as the filter; the machine does all the grinding and pouring for you. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps The water reservoir might have been a little bigger, and when I reviewed it the app wasn’t fully completed yet, but the company is currently working on fulfilling its Kickstarter orders, before shipping machines to its preorder customers next month. Xbloom says that its app will be fully brewed by the time the machines start shipping to new customers. In addition to its $800 flagship coffee machine, it’s also working on machines that can work well in restaurant settings. “People are still serving very bad coffee in Michelin three-star restaurants,” Xu notes, and suggests that the company is working on versions of its machine that can work well in higher-volume restaurant settings: Larger water tanks or the option to plumb it in means that anyone can make high-end pour-over coffee with beans from specialty roasters, without having to learn any of the actual coffee-making skills.   The company says it is also working on a more affordable machine with a lower price point later this year. In use, I enjoyed that the Xbloom made making pour-over coffee foolproof, but I also found myself wondering whether that’s worth $800 — that amount of money buys you a lot of coffee-making equipment that wouldn’t force you to use a single supplier for your coffee beans. I also found myself missing the ritual of making myself a cup of pour-over coffee: The five minutes it takes to mindfully prepare a beverage is a lovely pause in the work day. “I think this machine was never designed to replace the ritual of making coffee. We want people to buy this machine and eventually involve themselves. We always see ourselves being the gateway of specialty coffee,” Xu explained. “We aren’t trying to have yet another machine for the 2 million people who already make bean-to-cup coffee. The problem we are trying to solve is to introduce the rest of the 200 million coffee drinkers into this world.” The machine is fantastic. It looks great, and has one of the best amount-of-work-to-coffee-quality ratios I’ve ever experienced from a coffee machine. What I’m struggling with, however, is whether that is enough.   Personally, I think the price point is a major stumbling block for this product — yes, there are many people who can afford $800, but I’m struggling to imagine what the market looks like; it’s a very specific Venn diagram of customer needs. Xbloom is targeting people who care enough about coffee to spend $800, but that don’t care enough to spend that same money on an assortment of coffee-making equipment so they can make it themselves. I have to admit I’m a little impressed that the company was able to find 1,300 backers for its crowdfunding campaign. My business prediction is that until Xbloom launches its more affordable version of the machine, I’m not sure it’ll be able to find the next 10,000 customers. But, should that be wrong, and if Xbloom can find a way to reach its target audience, I forecast that the people who do end up buying one because they see the value of quality coffee and don’t want to spend the time making it at home will be very happy with the machine and the coffee it can create.

149,Y Combinator is back to bet on the Bay Area,['@nmasc_'],"April 5, 2023","Y Combinator, the startup accelerator that has launched the likes of Instacart, Stripe and Airbnb, has broadened its investing lens in recent years, backing companies all over Africa and India, and beyond. As the tech downturn has continued, though, Y Combinator has shrunk its cohort size, stepped back from late-stage investing and brought on a new chief executive: entrepreneur and co-founder of Initialized Capital, Garry Tan. In many ways, it’s a new era — but in some, it’s a return to the accelerator’s former geographic roots. Y Combinator’s winter 2023 batch has 282 startups — and 86% of the founders lived in San Francisco for the duration of the batch. This compares to 53% of founders based in SF last batch, 30% of founders who moved, and 23% who were already based there. “Hayes Valley truly became Cerebral Valley this year — San Francisco will continue to play a big role in the future of technology and will continue to bring together some of the smartest minds in the world,” Tan said, kicking off Y Combinator’s newest Demo Day. “The SF Bay Area is still a place for dreamers and doers to try their hand at their own future, and we have so much work to do.” The firm is throwing a summer conference later this June in Palo Alto, and conducted a series of dinners — as well as a kick-off event — across the Bay Area for this cohort.  Tan declined an interview request by TechCrunch. The accelerator says it is still remote-friendly — for example, it still only has a virtual demo day — but the return to the Bay Area also means a step back from international investments. Just 21% of publicly announced startups in the winter 2023 batch are based internationally, compared to 42% in the batch prior. While this is the first batch that is launching on Demo Day with Tan at the helm, the accelerator says founders were interviewed months before his first day. This is the first year in the recent past that YC hasn’t flexed the geographic breakdown of its startups in its blog post. Last batch, India topped the charts as the most represented country within the cohort, home to 21 companies, beyond the United States. This batch, India’s presence has nearly been cut in half, with only 11 publicly announced companies coming from the country. There are only three known startups from Africa in this batch, down 88% from a year ago, and continuing a retreat that began last year. The Bay Area’s philosophical return as a startup hub has partially been chalked up to its emergence as an artificial intelligence hot spot. Thanks to hacker homes and word of mouth, Hayes Valley has been dubbed by entrepreneurs and investors alike as “Cerebral Valley,” which many see as the convergence of aspiration and opportunity (too much, even). The accelerator’s return to the Bay Area is likely not disconnected to AI’s boom: A third of the companies in this cohort are building in AI, and a fifth — or 54 total — are specifically building generative AI startups. Y Combinator isn’t alone in its refocus on Silicon Valley. 500 Global just brought back Demo Day to San Francisco, although its class of startups came from all over the world. Techstars, one of the largest pre-seed investors in the world, just launched a new accelerator in Oakland, California. And earlier this week, Amazon announced a generative AI accelerator, with a demo day culminating in San Francisco.

150,How Jack Dorsey’s Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is fighting for the future of open source software,['@psawers'],"April 28, 2023","A crypto wallet theft lawsuit brought about by a man who claims to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto could jeopardize the future of open source software development. That’s according to the Jack Dorsey-backed Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, which is taking on a case to defend 11 Bitcoin developers named in a lawsuit filed by Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who emerged into the spotlight back in 2016 with a hotly disputed claim of being Bitcoin’s founding father. The crux of the case in question dates back to 2021 when Wright, through a Seychelles-based firm called Tulip Trading, launched a so-called “letter before action” against 16 Bitcoin software developers, in an attempt to regain access to £4 billion ($5 billion) worth of Bitcoin he claims to own. Wright said that he lost access to private keys for 111,000 Bitcoins after his home network was hacked the previous year, and that it was the responsibility of key Bitcoin Core (the main version of the Bitcoin protocol software) developers to remedy illegitimate crypto transactions. Although the case was initially dismissed last year before it made it to court, a U.K. appeals court reversed that decision back in March, allowing the case to proceed with a trial expected some time in 2024. In his findings, Lord Justice Birss pointed to academic literature that questions whether public blockchains really are decentralized. “If the decentralized governance of Bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property,” he wrote. So on Wednesday this week, 11 Bitcoin developers filed their defense with support from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, a not-for-profit set up in 2021 by Twitter and Block (formerly Square) co-founder Jack Dorsey, Block’s head of litigation Martin White and Chaincode Labs co-founder Alex Morcos. The fund now also includes chief legal officer Jess Jonas, who joined in January. The fund’s founders initially penned an open letter to Bitcoin developers last year to explain their raison d’être. They pointed to the “multi-front litigation” that the Bitcoin community faces, including Craig Wright’s efforts which they confirmed at the time it would be leading the defense for. While they noted that the main purpose of the fund was to defend developers “from lawsuits regarding their activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem,” they also noted that the ramifications extended far deeper into the broader open source realm. “Litigation and continued threats are having their intended effect — individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support,” the trio wrote. “Open source developers, who are often independent, are especially susceptible to legal pressure. In response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.” In truth, the issue of the legal system interfering with open source software development has become a hot topic of late. In a letter to EU authorities last week, more than a dozen open source industry bodies said that the newly proposed Cyber Resilience Act, which seeks to codify cybersecurity practices for digital products sold in Europe, may have a “chilling effect” on software development, as open source developers could be held personally liable for security slip-ups that happen in a downstream product. In other words, if the Act is to pass in its current form, developers might be less inclined to contribute to open source projects for fear of legal wrangles. Elsewhere, some argue that the EU’s upcoming AI Act, which seeks to govern AI applications based on perceived risks, could create burdensome legal liability for open source developers working on general purpose AI systems (GPAI), and give greater power to well-financed big tech companies. While the latest episode to emerge around Bitcoin is somewhat different, it gives rise to similar issues. The overarching story may well be about who does or doesn’t get to control Bitcoin, and whether the project’s core developer base should be forced to create some sort of “back door” to serve third-party access to private keys. But bubbling under the surface is something that’s fundamental to the future of software, and whether open source developers should have have a fiduciary duty to their users. “We believe that these lawsuits are frivolous, but we still have to oppose them vigorously,” Jonas said in a statement. Pivotal to the defendants’ case is the simple fact that Bitcoin was released under an open source MIT License, which bestows little in the way of any legal responsibility on those maintaining the software. The MIT License explicitly states: In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. But if, for whatever reason, a court was to rule on the side of Tulip Trading, this could effectively destroy one of the core tenets of the MIT License that underpins countless open source projects today, setting a dangerous precedent that compels open source developers — many of whom work in their own time on their own dime — to serve the end-user of that software, no matter what their demands. “The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund fights not just for Bitcoin but for the right of open-source developers to create and freely share their code with the world for the greater good,” Morcos said in a separate statement. “The Tulip Trading case threatens not only the MIT License but also the very notion of freedom of speech. Our collective mission is to safeguard innovation by shielding developers from legal intimidation.” While there are 16 defendants in total, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is only representing 11 developers who worked on Bitcoin Core. There is a 12th Bitcoin Core defendant who has not sought help from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, plus a further four defendants that have worked on various Bitcoin forks who are arranging their own counsel. Separately, Wright has initiated a secondary case against other Bitcoin developer entities, with Wright claiming ownership of Bitcoin copyright and database rights on the basis that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. This case was thrown out back in February, but the lawsuit quickly reemerged in a revised form with the defendants filing their defense last month. The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is supporting two Bitcoin Core developers named in that lawsuit too. “The outcomes of these cases are important for everyone, even those who may not be interested in Bitcoin, because these lawsuits could have serious detrimental effects on open-source development writ large, which will negatively impact our lives in ways we may not even realize until it’s too late,” Dorsey added in a statement."
151,MCU’s female superhero trio team up in ‘The Marvels’ movie,['@laurenforristal'],"April 11, 2023","Marvel Studios released a teaser trailer today for “The Marvels,” featuring three badass female superheroes — Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel and Captain Rambeau. The movie is set to hit theaters on November 10 and sees Brie Larson, Iman Vellani and Teyonah Parris reprise their roles. “The Marvels” is the third movie of the MCU’s Phase Five and takes place right after the post-credits scene in the season one finale of the Disney+ series “Ms. Marvel.” The scene showed Kamala (Vellani) swapping places with Carol Danvers (Larson). The trailer confirms that whenever one of the Marvels uses her abilities, someone switches places. For instance, Kamala switches with S.A.B.E.R. astronaut Captain Monica Rambeau, while she’s working with Nick Fury in space. In addition to the body-switching dilemma, the three superheroes must team up to stop a new intergalactic threat — the Kree Empire. The footage from the teaser trailer was first revealed at the D23 Expo 2022. Marvel Studios has since shifted the theatrical release of “The Marvels” from July 28 to November. The movie will arrive on Disney+ later in the year. It’s our guess that it’ll get a streaming release in late December, approximately 45 days after the theatrical release.  "
152,Samsung’s ‘News’ app launches with custom feeds and daily briefings,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 18, 2023","Samsung announced today that it’s introducing a “Samsung News” app that gives users access to everyday news from a variety of publications. The app, which will replace the company’s current “Samsung Free” app, includes custom news feeds, along with morning and evening briefings about the top news of the day. The company’s current Samsung Free app, which offers access to news articles, podcasts, live TV and games, will be rebranded to Samsung News. Unlike Samsung Free, the new revamped app solely focuses on news and podcasts, just like Apple News. Samsung News offers access to news content from a variety of news outlets, including Axios, CNN, Fortune, Huffington Post, Newsweek, Reuters, Sports Illustrated, USA Today and more. Samsung says additional news outlets will be added to the app over time. You can access news within the app through categorized feeds or though a “Following” tab that you can customize with your preferences based on the news you want to see. Samsung News also includes daily briefings that are delivered twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening. The company says these briefings are compilid by a team of news editors to bring users the top headlines of the day in one place. There’s also the option to listen to podcasts within the app. Image Credits: Samsung Image Credits: Samsung Once you open the app, you’ll notice that it looks pretty similar to the Apple New interface. The homepage of the app highlights top stories and the bottom of the page lets you navigate between “News,” “Podcasts” and “Following.” Samsung News is rolling out to U.S. Samsung Galaxy users as an update to Samsung Free starting today. Users who already have the Samsung Free app on their device will see the icon change to Samsung News starting today when their apps are updated. If you don’t already have the Free app, you can download the new News app directly from the Samsung Galaxy Store. “Samsung News was designed to deliver breaking and premium news to the fingertips of Galaxy users in an easy to access format,” said Avner Ronen, the VP of Product Development at Samsung Electronics, in a press release. “Our goal is to empower consumers by letting them curate their ideal news consumption experience with a single swipe.” Although Samsung Galaxy users have had quick access to news via the Free app in the past, it’s been hidden and not that well-known. And of course, Samsung Galaxy users have had access to Google News as well, but today’s launch brings Samsung more in-line with what Apple offers its users through Apple News.  "
153,"SoftBank LatAm sees past recent losses, remains bullish on region",['@bayareawriter'],"April 6, 2023","When SoftBank announced in 2019 that it had allocated $5 billion to investing in Latin American startups, it felt like an inflection point for the region. And then when the Japanese investment conglomerate announced it had committed another $3 billion to startups there, it was only further validation that Latin America was home to a formidable startup system. About $7.6 billion of that capital has been allocated across more than 80 investments, according to Juan Franck, managing partner of the SoftBank Latin America Funds. This means that SoftBank still has $400 million to back companies across LatAm, with about 50% of that money going to new investments and the other half going to existing portfolio companies. Despite the fact that the total fair value of those investments was $6.4 billion at the end of 2022, the Latin America Fund’s managing partners say they are bullish on continuing to deploy capital in the region. “We continue to be extremely excited about the opportunities in LatAm,” said Alex Szapiro, managing partner of the funds, in an interview. “It is very early still where we are with our fund.” The pair remain optimistic despite the fact that in February, SoftBank Group’s investment vehicles — including its Latin America fund — posted a loss of $5.8 billion in the quarter that ended in December 2022 as the Japanese tech investor continues to bleed through the market downturn and significantly pares back new backings. That marked the fourth straight quarter in which SoftBank Group has reported losing money. While SoftBank declined to provide specifics as to how many companies in Latin America it has backed over the past 18 months, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that since January 2022, the firm has participated in 16 investments with a total value of about $400 million. Most recently, SoftBank put money in a funding round raised by Rankmi in Chile. “We do not have a pre-established target for number of deals, value of investments or number of companies that we will invest in 2023,” Szapiro told TechCrunch. “We still have dry powder from LatAm Fund II and access to Vision Fund II. We are not concerned with capital deployment. The goal is to find companies that fit our investment thesis.” The duo believe that SoftBank, despite its losses, has a competitive advantage over other global investors putting money into LatAm startups in that it has members of its investment team working in various parts of the region such as Brazil, Mexico and Miami. (This makes sense considering that about 80% of its investment dollars in the region have gone to Brazilian and Mexican startups.) “From 2019 to 2021, a lot of players came into the region, but when the markets got a little bit shaky, those tourist funds left,” Szapiro said. “We believe you need to have someone on the ground…Also, we understand the entrepreneurs in the market.” In Latin America, where founders seek relationships just as much as they do capital, SoftBank hopes to capitalize on having an investment team that hails from the very regions in which it’s seeking to invest. “Many are first time-founders and it’s their first time going to venture and they rely on us for much more beyond capital,” Szapiro said. “So we help them on the legal and HR side and with things like product development and marketing. We have teams in those areas, and they rely on us helping a lot.” For Franck, that’s where SoftBank’s “long-term commitment comes to bear,” especially as the startup world faces a downturn globally and capital is not nearly as easy to come by. “2023 is really about going back to the basics, focusing on your product, focusing on your customer and also focusing on profitable and sustainable growth,” he told TechCrunch. “And so, portfolio management is as important a job for us as making new investments in current portfolio companies or new portfolio companies. But the fact that we’re on the ground, operating elbow to elbow with the entrepreneurs, and also showing up for follow-on investments. I think it also is a great opportunity for us to just cement our message of long-term commitment to the region.” Over time, SoftBank has seen a few exits in the region, including Itaú, Brazil’s largest private bank, acquiring 35% of Avenue; Paystand, a U.S.-focused B2B payments network, acquiring100% of Yaydoo and Brazilian edtech giant Arco Educação acquiring 75% of Isaac in an all-stock deal. Other companies it has backed include Creditas, Kavak, Inter, VTEX, QuintoAndar and Rappi. Of course SoftBank is not the only firm with people on the ground aimed at backing and/or helping startups in the region. For example, Kaszek earlier this week announced it had closed on $975 million across two new funds to back startups in the region. And last year, Latitud raised $11.5 million in seed funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and NFX toward its effort to become “the operating system for every venture-backed company in LatAm.” In recent years, SoftBank has also backed companies in other countries, such as Chile and Colombia, for example. And it plans to continue to do so. “Good opportunities transcend geographical barriers,” Franck said. “And so we don’t spend too much time thinking about the country we are concentrating on.” Overall, the pair concede that while investment pace slowed in 2022 as many venture firms were essentially “on lockdown,” the demand for capital is also down — particularly in LatAm, where founders have historically been forced to be more disciplined than their U.S. counterparts because it’s generally more difficult to raise venture money there. “There is a lot of dry powder but I would say that funds in general are being much more disciplined on business models and valuations of companies,” Franck said. “At the same time, a lot of the companies in our portfolio and across the region still have the cash on the balance sheet that they raised in 2021 and 2022. So that gives them the flexibility to actually continue to use that cash in a context of optimization and cash runway extension, and to not actually have to come to market in the short to medium term, especially in a market where the context would potentially demand terms that they aren’t willing to accept.”  "
154,UniSieve’s filters use special crystals to reduce industrial emissions,['@catherineshu'],"April 26, 2023","The energy-intensive process of separating and purifying chemicals and gases is a big reason industries like plastic manufacturing cause so much pollution. UniSieve wants to reduce their carbon emissions and operational costs with its tech, which uses a high-precision membrane with special crystals that can filter specific molecules and ions. Today the Zurich-based startup announced it has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to pilot and expand its operational capacities. The round, which UniSieve said was oversubscribed, included participation from the Amadeus Apex Technology Fund, Wingman Ventures, CIECH Ventures and Zürcher Kantonalbank. UniSieve was founded in 2018 by ETH Zürich classmates Samuel Hess and Elia Schneider. During the course of their work, they developed a way to integrate porous crystals called zeolitic materials into polymeric membranes and use them for high-precision filters. They also figured out how to make manufacturing scalable. UniSieve is already making revenue and currently has more than 24 clients, including chemical and energy companies. Currently focused on CO2 capturing, UniSieve is also piloting hydrocarbon (organic compounds made of hydrogen and carbon) separation applications. Heavy industries, including plastics, chemical and gas plants, have legacy systems in place that are worth billions of dollars, said Hess. These often include processes for separation and purification that require a lot of thermal energy. UniSieve’s modular filters, which Hess compared to Nespresso capsules, can be integrated into existing manufacturing systems. UniSieve’s membrane cartridges. Image Credits: UniSieve UniSieve’s membrane cartridges. Image Credits: UniSieve UniSieve stands for “universal sieving” and its technology does not use thermal energy. Instead, its membranes separate chemicals, energy carriers and CO2 from flue gas based on size exclusion. To use another coffee-related metaphor, UniSieve’s membranes are like the coffee filters that keep your drink free from grounds. Like Nespresso or printer manufacturers, UniSieve sells containerized separation systems and membrane replacement services. When asked to explain what it means to “integrate zeolitic materials into polymeric membranes” in layperson’s terms, Hess explained that “it’s like adding special filters to a plastic membrane to make it work better at purifying water, filtering gases and performing other tasks.” Hess and Schneider originally worked on water purification membranes before they had their “lightbulb moment.” The two introduced zeolitic materials, or porous crystals, into polymeric, or plastic-like, membranes. Hess explained that zeolites have a well-defined pore structure that can trap or selectively filter certain molecules or ions. When added to polymeric membranes, the combination results in better selectivity, permeability and stability, especially for separating gases. Team UniSieve. Image Credits: UniSieve Team UniSieve. Image Credits: UniSieve One challenge UniSieve had to solve is that chemicals can vary in size by a fraction of an angstrom (or one-tenth of a nanometer). That means its filters have to be extremely accurate. Hess said UniSieve’s ability to be precisely tuned means it can be adapted to many different applications, including separating other gases besides CO2. Hess said UniSieve competes against other new technologies like distillation or amine scrubbing, which uses special solvents to remove acid gas. “Compared to such systems, UniSieve’s membrane solution is up to 90% more energy efficient and can be applied at small, as well as large scale. There are a few emerging companies trying to get into the chemical purification market with membranes, too,” Hess said. “Due to operational limitations, a broad application of these competing membranes does not seem realistic.” In a statement, Wingman Ventures founding partner Lukas Weder said, “The UniSieve technology solution has been tried, tested and is ready to be deployed and so, perfectly positioned to help companies quickly over to build very powerful energy efficient production processes.”"
155,"Amid the AI hype, don’t forget about no-code",['@alex'],"April 18, 2023","No-code startup Softr, which allows its customers to build apps from their existing data, announced Tuesday that it has added Google Sheets to its integration list. Previously, Softr focused on Airtable databases. Its move to support data from Google’s spreadsheet product likely expands its potential customer pool. Even before that expansion, CEO Mariam Hakobyan told TechCrunch+ that her company grew its annual recurring revenue 3x from December 2021 to December 2022. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Softr’s quick revenue expansion is a good reminder that while the tech world seems completely consumed by all things AI, there’s quite a lot of work going on in other areas that are worth keeping an eye on. That said, there is an interesting connection between AI and no-code worth writing down: Both are potentially great expanders of human capability. AI tooling could operate as a second brain of sorts for the digitally busy, and no-code services may allow nondevelopers to build the tools they need to complete their work. In both cases, the genres of new tech development have a shot at helping regular folks do a lot more, more quickly and often at a low cost. Something else that modern AI tooling and no-code share is accessibility. Softr, for example, grew its base of signed-up users from 35,000 to 150,000 in 2022. That’s really quite a lot for a service that was, until recently, Airtable-specific. On the AI side, I don’t need to reiterate just how much market demand there is for modern LLM tooling. Let’s dig into Softr’s progress since we last covered the company and chat about what we can learn about no-code progress as a method of building more accessible software. Ask anyone who works at a company that builds software and isn’t part of the engineering or product orgs how long it will take them to get something built for their own needs. Without even making Jira ticket jokes, we all know what the answer will be. And to a degree, the standard situation makes sense: What nondeveloper employees need is often pretty basic software, and expensive engineers need to focus on the company’s core offering not internal tooling."
156,Adobe brings Firefly to its video tools,['@fredericl'],"April 17, 2023","A month ago, Adobe announced Firefly, its entry into the generative AI game. Initially, Firefly’s focus was on generating commercially safe images, but the company is now pushing its technology beyond still images. As the company announced today, it will soon bring Firefly to its Creative Cloud video and audio applications. To be clear, you won’t (yet) be able to use Firefly to create custom videos yet. Instead, the emphasis here is on making it easier for anyone to edit videos, color grade using just a few words, add music and sound effects and create title cards with animated fonts, graphics and logos. However, Firefly also promises to automatically turn scripts into storyboards and pre-visualizations — and it will recommend b-roll to liven up videos. Maybe the highlight of these promised new features is being able to color grade a video by simply describing what a video should look like with just a few words (think “golden hour” or “brighten face”). Image Credits: Adobe Image Credits: Adobe It’s no secret that color grading is an art — and not one that comes easy to most people. Now, anyone will be able to describe the desired mood and tone of a scene and Adobe’s video tools will follow suit. In many ways, it’s this democratization of skill that’s at the heart of what Adobe is doing with Firefly in its creative tools. Other new AI-based features include the ability to generate custom sounds and music. Firefly will also help editors create subtitles, logos and title cards by having them describe what they want them to look like. Those, too, are somewhat specialized skills that take some familiarity with the likes of After Effects and Premiere. Image Credits: Adobe Image Credits: Adobe The real game changer, though, is that Adobe also plans to use Firefly to read scripts and automatically generate storyboards and pre-visualizations. That could be a massive time saver — and I wouldn’t be surprised if you saw those videos pop up on TikTok. Image Credits: Adobe Image Credits: Adobe It’s worth noting that for now, we’ve only seen Adobe’s own demos of these features. It remains to be seen how well they will work in practice. Adobe’s aim is to ensure that all of its generative AI tools are safe to use in a commercial environment. With its generative image creator, this meant that it could only train it on a limited number of images that were either in public domain or part of its Adobe Stock service. However, this also means it’s quite a bit more limited when compared to the likes of Midjourney or Stable Diffusion.  "
157,Build a bottom-up financial model to show potential investors you’re serious,['@shulmanrogers'],"April 10, 2023","Preparing to raise a round of funding is one of the most important tasks every founder has to do. Compiling a deck, a teaser, and an executive summary requires a thorough understanding of a startup’s story and the market in which it operates. But for many founders, the most challenging item required is often the most crucial: building a financial model. A sound financial model not only helps founders understand their own business and how much capital to raise, but is also usually required by an investor, who will comb through the model during due diligence. Your model is your financial roadmap. As a founder, it’s your responsibility to never lose sight of your “runway” — how long before you run out of cash — which is calculated by dividing your cash on hand by your monthly burn rate. Your model should reflect a runway that is long enough to get you to your next round of financing or break-even cash flow under a more conservative set of revenue assumptions. What do the next 12 to 18 months look like from a cash-flow perspective? For example, does the business have enough runway even if you achieve only half of your expected revenue — or no revenue? Here’s your model’s end goal: to cohesively demonstrate to a potential investor how your business will grow from both a revenue and an expenses perspective and to indicate how much money you should raise. While it may feel unfamiliar, as a founder there are a few key things to keep in mind that will ensure that your financial model is both a powerful tool for you and is also investor ready. As a founder, it’s your responsibility to never lose sight of your “runway” — how long before you run out of cash — which is calculated by dividing your cash on hand by your monthly burn rate. No one can predict the future, but you need to tell an investable story that demonstrates your company’s potential to grow. It usually takes five years to show how a business scales, and if you are not realistic in presenting how your business will do that, the model may be discounted by an investor. Most investors will want to see a three-year projection at a minimum — but five years provides for a more reasonable ramp up in revenue and profitability. A financial model will often include a few different statements: income statement (profit and loss statement), cash-flow statement, and a balance sheet. For early-stage companies, with limited assets and liabilities, a balance sheet will often not be as relevant as it would be for a later-stage company. The focus is, therefore, on the income statement and some version of a cash-flow statement. Your income statement may be broken down into revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, fixed costs, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). EBITDA can serve as a proxy for cash flow, or you can prepare a more formal cash-flow statement. There are two ways to build a financial model: top down and bottom up. In a top-down approach, you estimate the size of the market and calculate your percentage of that total market revenue each year. A bottom-up model is more powerful, detailed, and comprehensive. In this model, you start with granular assumptions that drive revenue and build on each other."
158,Asana launches new work intelligence tools with AI on the way,['@ron_miller'],"March 28, 2023","With all the software tools we have, it’s still hard to figure out how work moves across large organizations, the state of projects and how closely people are tracking against personal, team and company goals. Asana, which is built on top of a work graph, has that knowledge, and the company announced a new set of dashboards today to give managers the data they need to make sure projects are staying on budget and meeting goals. Alex Hood, chief product officer at Asana, says that the reporting capabilities put a set of information at managers’ fingertips that previously had to be manually pulled from various systems. “We’ve created executive reporting that can live at any altitude of the company. So no matter [your job], you can have your set of dashboards of the things that you care about that come in instantly just by selecting [in Asana] which teams and projects and portfolios that you care about,” Hood told TechCrunch. In practice, this involves providing a single view of strategic initiatives, team capacity and budgets. Hood says it builds on the graph model that underlies the entire Asana platform, but the company is working to bring artificial intelligence to the process to make it even smarter. “The next step will be using AI to generate the portfolios of the things that you care about instantaneously. So having them become smarter and smarter, but the fact that they can be at any level across an entire organization, that is part of this new launch,” he said. In addition, the platform now helps people understand the workload for any given skill across the organization to see who has bandwidth and who is overloaded to help companies more evenly distribute workloads, what Asana refers to as “resource intelligence.” “We are shipping the ability to see the workload of anybody across the whole domain or organization… We show [this data] in a very graphical format, so you can see who’s burning out, who’s under capacity, and you can load-balance between them across an organization that doesn’t even share a hierarchy,” he said. Finally, the company is offering a new tool called workflow bundles which relies on what it refers to as “execution intelligence.” This involves providing workflow templates that a company can use to build its own workflows. “We’ve had workflows in our product for some time, but we’re making workflow bundles super easy to pull off the shelf. So we’re going to have best-practice workflows that are pre-constructed that you just plug your pieces into,” he said. While none of these tools has AI built into them just yet, Hood says the next iteration of these tools will definitely be built with it. “So we have these three new features that are not AI-driven yet. But they are features that point our nose towards the types of problems that we want to solve with AI, because the next generation that lives on top of them will be AI-driven,” he said."
159,Snapchat+ subscription now has more than 3 million users,['@indianidle'],"April 19, 2023","Snap said today that its Snapchat+ paid plan has more than 3 million users. At its Snap Partner Summit event, the company added that in the coming days, Verizon users will have the option to buy Snapchat+ subscriptions through the carrier’s subscription store called +play. The company launched the paid tier last June and expanded to multiple regions in the following months. Snap reached the 1 million subscriber mark last August and the 2 million subscriber mark in February indicating steady growth. And yet, 3 million subscribers still represent less than 1% of the 375 million daily active users on the platform. Snapchat has added a number of new features in the past few months like custom notification sounds, story expiration controls, customizable chat wallpapers and a plan gifting option. It has also promised that it will allow paid users to freeze their Snap Streaks. The company has additionally focused on bringing generative AI features to subscribers. In February, it launched My AI chatbot for Snapchat+ users. Following complaints about the bot posting inappropriate responses, the company announced new safety tools around the AI bot earlier this month. In the past few weeks, Snap has also introduced a feature that lets subscribers generate a background through text prompts. As the company is making My AI bot available to all Snapchat users, it said that Snapchat+ users will later this year gain a feature where the bot will reply to them with a visual Snap — essentially generating an image based on the conversation. The company has earned $80 million through in-app purchases — this figure also includes an estimated $1 million on other purchases like filters — since the launch of Snapchat+, according to Abe Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower. Yousef noted that 57% of Snapchat+ subscribers are based out of the U.S., 10% of them are from the U.K. and 5% each from Saudi Arabia, Australia and Canada. For comparison, Snap posted an annual revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022. So, at the moment, subscriptions represent a fraction of the company’s earnings. With the addition of Snapchat+ to Verizon’s +play store, Verizon customers will get three months of the subscription service for free when they sign up. Snap’s service is the first of its kind on +play, which largely focuses on streaming service subscriptions. The store now offers services from over 30 other partners across streaming, entertainment, lifestyle and education services. +play is available to all Verizon mobile, 5G Home and LTE Home Internet customers.

160,Italy gives OpenAI initial to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order,['@riptari'],"April 12, 2023","Italy’s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month — when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals’ data. The EU’s GDPR applies whenever personal data is processed, and there’s no doubt large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT have hoovered up vast amounts of the stuff off the public internet in order to train their generative AI models to be able to respond in a human-like way to natural language prompts. OpenAI responded to the Italian data protection authority’s order by swiftly geoblocking access to ChatGPT. In a brief public statement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also tweeted confirmation it had ceased offering the service in Italy — doing so alongside the usual Big Tech boilerplate caveat that it “think[s] we are following all privacy laws.” Italy’s Garante evidently takes a different view. The short version of the regulator’s new compliance demand is this: OpenAI will have to get transparent and publish an information notice detailing its data processing; it must immediately adopt age gating to prevent minors from accessing the tech and move to more robust age verification measures; it needs to clarify the legal basis it’s claiming for processing people’s data for training its AI (and cannot rely on performance of a contract — meaning it has to choose between consent or legitimate interests); it also has to provide ways for users (and non-users) to exercise rights over their personal data, including asking for corrections of disinformation generated about them by ChatGPT (or else have their data deleted); it must also provide users with an ability to object to OpenAI’s processing of their data for training its algorithms; and it must conduct a local awareness campaign to inform Italians that its processing their information to train its AIs. The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline — of April 30 — to get most of that done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.) There’s also a little more time for the additional requirement to migrate from the immediately required (but weak) age gating child safety tech to a harder-to-circumvent age verification system. OpenAI has been given until May 31 to submit a plan for implementing age verification tech to filter out users below age 13 (and users aged 13 to 18 who had not obtained parental consent) — with the deadline for having that more robust system in place set at September 30. In a press release detailing what OpenAI must do in order for it to lift the temporary suspension on ChatGPT, ordered two weeks ago when the regulator announced it was commencing a formal investigation of suspected GDPR breaches, it writes: OpenAI will have to comply by 30 April with the measures set out by the Italian SA [supervisory authority] concerning transparency, the right of data subjects — including users and non-users — and the legal basis of the processing for algorithmic training relying on users’ data. Only in that case will the Italian SA lift its order that placed a temporary limitation on the processing of Italian users’ data, there being no longer the urgency underpinning the order, so that ChatGPT will be available once again from Italy. Going into more detail on each of the required “concrete measures,” the DPA stipulates that the mandated information notice must describe “the arrangements and logic of the data processing required for the operation of ChatGPT along with the rights afforded to data subjects (users and non-users),” adding that it “will have to be easily accessible and placed in such a way as to be read before signing up to the service.” Users from Italy must be presented with this notice prior to signing up and also confirm they are over 18, it further requires. While users who registered prior to the DPA’s stop-data-processing order will have to be shown the notice when they access the reactivated service and must also be pushed through an age gate to filter out underage users. On the legal basis issue attached to OpenAI’s processing of people’s data for training it’s algorithms, the Garante has narrowed the available options down to two: consent or legitimate interests — stipulating that it must immediately remove all references to performance of a contract “in line with the [GDPR’s] accountability principle.” (OpenAI’s privacy policy currently cites all three grounds but appears to lean most heavily on performance of a contract for providing services like ChatGPT.) “This will be without prejudice to the exercise the SA’s investigation and enforcement powers in this respect,” it adds, confirming it is withholding judgment on whether the two remaining grounds can be used lawfully for OpenAI’s purposes too. Additionally, the GDPR provides data subjects with a suite of access rights, including a right to corrections or deletion of their personal data. Which is why the Italian regulator has also demanded that OpenAI implements tools so that data subjects — which means both users and non-users — can exercise their rights and get falsities the chatbot generates about them rectified. Or, if correcting AI-generated lies about named individuals is found to be “technically unfeasible,” the DPA stipulates the company must provide a way for their personal data to be deleted. “OpenAI will have to make available easily accessible tools to allow non-users to exercise their right to object to the processing of their personal data as relied upon for the operation of the algorithms. The same right will have to be afforded to users if legitimate interest is chosen as the legal basis for processing their data,” it adds, referring to another of the rights GDPR affords data subjects when legitimate interest is relied upon as the legal basis for processing personal data. All of the measures the Garante has announced are contingencies, based on its preliminary concerns. And its press release notes that its formal inquiries — “to establish possible infringements of the legislation” — carry on and could lead to it deciding to take “additional or different measures if this proves necessary upon completion of the fact-finding exercise under way.” We reached out to OpenAI for a response but the company had not replied to our email at press time.

161,A new Drake x The Weeknd track just blew up — but it’s an AI fake,['@asilbwrites'],"April 17, 2023","A song featuring the voices of Drake and The Weeknd called “Heart on My Sleeve” has amassed over 250,000 Spotify streams and 10 million views on TikTok. But the two renowned musicians had nothing to do with the song — an artist going by the name “Ghostwriter” generated the song using AI. Drake and The Weeknd have not yet responded to the song, but Drake recently commented on AI-generated music that rips off his voice. When Drake noticed an AI model of himself singing “Munch” by Ice Spice, he wrote on his Instagram story, “This is the final straw AI.” It’s possible he was messing around, but he would be far from the first major artist to take issue with the rising count of deepfake songs. In 2020, Jay-Z’s agency Roc Nation submitted copyright strikes against YouTube uploads of AI-generated Jay-Z deepfakes, but YouTube ended up reinstating the videos. And just last week, the same thing happened to Eminem; UMG, which represents both of these rappers, issued a copyright strike on AI-generated YouTube videos of Eminem rapping about cats. Ghostwriter and Spotify did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment. Copyright law is not technologically advanced enough to have specific guidelines regarding generative AI. But in the legal code’s existing state, transformative parody is permissible. However, these laws are very much open to interpretation, since the idea of what makes work “transformative” is subjective, and there is little case law to set precedent — historically, many of these cases have settled before reaching a judge. UMG has recently taken steps to prevent the proliferation of AI-generated music that rips off its recording artists. According to a Financial Times report, UMG asked streaming services like Spotify to prevent AI companies from using its music to train their models. “We have a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” a UMG representative said in a statement. The representative said that the rise of AI-generated music “begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation.” Once any kind of artistic work is part of a dataset, it can be hard to remove it. To help bring control back to artists, technologists Mat Dryhurst and Holly Herndon founded Spawning AI. One of their projects, “Have I Been Trained,” allows users to search for their artwork and see if it has been incorporated into an AI training set without their consent. In some cases, though, removing one’s intellectual property from AI models can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. A living illustrator who has crafted detailed, high fantasy artwork for franchises like “Dungeons & Dragons,” Greg Rutkowski was one of Stable Diffusion’s most popular search terms when it launched in September, allowing users to easily replicate his distinctive style. Rutkowski never consented to his artwork being used to train the algorithm, and once the flood gates are opened, it might be too late for Rutkowski to regain the control he used to have over his work. For now, Ghostwriter’s fake Drake and The Weeknd song remains on Spotify, but it may not be there for long.  "
162,Meta says time spent on Instagram grew 24% thanks to TikTok-style AI Reel recommendations,['@etherington'],"April 26, 2023","Meta shared some updated engagement info around its platforms on its Q1 2023 quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, with Meta CFO Susan Li joining CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg to field questions from analysts about its results. Zuckerberg shared that time spent on Instagram has grown more than 24% since the company launched Reels on the platform thanks to AI-powered content recommendations — aka, the kind of non-connection recommended videos that TikTok basically built its entire brand upon. “We’re very pleased with what we’ve seen Reels drive in terms of incremental engagement on the platform so far,” Li said later in response to an analyst question, adding that “it’s clear that people value short-term video” on the platform. She further clarified that Instagram is also seeing a lot more sharing around Reels in recent months. “We’re seeing the sharing flywheel take off with Reels re-shares, with re-shares doubling over the last six months,” she said. Li seemed to shy away from an analyst question regarding whether Reels was having a similar impact on Facebook proper, but did repeatedly note that on FB, AI-driven recommendations that don’t come from direct connections are increasing engagement among users. While Reels and AI recommendations are driving more engagement on Instagram, that’s not yet directly translating to more revenue. In fact, Li acknowledged that Reels are actually cannibalizing some revenue from Stories and feed-based posts, since they’re accounting for some of the time users would’ve spent engaging with that content. The larger trend is incremental however, meaning overall user time is going up, which Li said will eventually be a positive point for revenue potential. She said Reels is on track to be revenue-neutral by end of year, or early 2024, and looked ahead to positive contributions sometime after that. She did point out that there will be product work in figuring out proper monetization for Reels, since they’re “structurally different” from existing Instagram content types. “We don’t have line of sight to getting Reels to monetization parity with feed or Stories per time because of those structural differences,” but because it’s driving incremental growth, she said they’re confident they will eventually become a key contributor to monetization."

The streaming service will soon launch channels like PBS Kids, local PBS stations and Magnolia Network. In the coming months, local PBS affiliates will roll out to Hulu Live TV, giving users access to shows like “Antiques Roadshow,” “Frontline,” “Masterpiece” and more. The PBS stations reach viewers in more than 300 markets and cities across the U.S. PBS Kids will also soon become available, including its popular TV series “Alma’s Way,” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” and “Wild Kratts.” Later this month, on May 25, Magnolia Network will join the lineup, bringing family-friendly on-demand titles like “Magnolia Table with Joanna Gaines,” “Silos Baking Competition” and “Maine Cabin Masters,” as well as live TV programming. Magnolia Network is a media joint venture between Discovery and Chip and Joanna Gaines, owners of the remodeling and design business Magnolia Homes and hosts of HGTV’s “Fixer Upper.” PBS, PBS Kids and Magnolia Network are among the most frequently requested channels for Hulu, said Reagan Feeney, SVP of Live TV Content Programming and Partnerships, in a statement. “As one of the largest live TV streaming services in the U.S., we are committed to providing a best-in-class user experience and a premium national and local channel lineup for our millions of subscribers,” Feeney added. As of February, Hulu has 48 million subscribers, with 4.5 million being Live TV customers. Parent company Disney is set to report its Q2 2023 results on May 10.

164,How to run efficient and effective early-stage board meetings,['@amyecheetham'],"May 2, 2023","Of all the things an early-stage founder has to figure out, one of the most unexpected is how to get the most from your board. But effectively leveraging your board for guidance and support is essential. The slides you use can help you run efficient, effective board meetings that get the most out of the discussions they elicit. A lot has been written about optimal board meeting cadence, process and hygiene, but for the sake of completeness, at the earlier stages, often shorter (~1.5 hrs), more frequent meetings (~6 weeks) make sense. Each board will have their preference and ultimately the cadence needs to work for everyone. You’ll want to send your materials 24-48 hours in advance to give participants time to review the material and formulate their questions. It’s also essential to include your “Head of…” functional leaders to discuss their areas of expertise. Then dive into the material! As a CEO, your goal is to communicate the progress of the business clearly and elicit constructive feedback. So the information in your deck is more important than the visual design as you put together your board deck, although both matter. The slides in this article aren’t meant to be a complete board deck. They are examples of real, early-stage board slides from seed and Series A stage companies that did a great job informing their boards and driving constructive discussions. [Disclosure: Costanoa Ventures has invested in Highnote and Highline.] Image Credits: Costanoa Ventures Image Credits: Costanoa Ventures This is a strong open: It briefly recaps major accomplishments and sets the stage for the company’s key priorities until the next board update. It also effectively frames the CEO’s key discussion points with the board. While ideally your board will have read slides in advance, they often won’t. This slide helps everyone level-set up front, creating a framework for helpful discussion. Remember, that’s what a board meeting is all about: discussion, not a presentation or a read-out. Image Credits: Costanoa Ventures Image Credits: Costanoa Ventures Here’s another great slide: The “business metrics overview” is a snapshot of the key metrics by which the board should measure the company. Each company will have its own key metrics, but it’s good to open with a summary that sets the context for how progress should be measured. Your board members typically work with many companies, and don’t always know the best ways to measure your company’s progress. So this is where you frame how best to understand your specific key metrics. For early-stage companies, revenue is usually a lagging indicator (so not your most important metric). By setting out what are your key metrics, and flagging them with red or green dots, for instance, your board can quickly see what is/isn’t on track, which they always need to know. Unlike you, they don’t live and die by your plan, so you’ll need to remind them here. Image Credits: Costanoa Ventures Image Credits: Costanoa Ventures "

166,Lightspeed fuels Indian workspace interiors platform Officebanao with $6M funding,['@jagmeets13'],"April 10, 2023","Officebanao, an Indian startup offering a workspace interiors platform to businesses in the country, has raised $6 million in seed funding led by Lightspeed. In India’s competitive workspace interior market, traditional providers have long dominated the landscape, often requiring substantial investment of time and resources for clients to achieve their desired results. Furthermore, many of these established firms primarily target large corporations, offering only partial solutions that leave customers seeking third-party assistance to fully design their new or existing office spaces. Officebanao is challenging this status quo with its comprehensive, end-to-end service, which features an interactive visual design process tailored to businesses of all sizes — from small and mid-sized enterprises to ambitious startups and established giants. The Gurugram-headquartered startup’s platform brings architects, contractors, designers, material suppliers and even office furniture providers together under one umbrella, streamlining the process for clients. Catering to a diverse range of commercial interiors, the startup covers all stages of design, procurement, and execution for projects that span from modest $12,200 office spaces to sprawling $610,000 designs and beyond. Additionally, Officebanao is using newer technology to advance the interior design process for workspaces. By expediting the fulfillment of design requirements and streamlining operations, the platform not only delivers greater efficiency for clients but also ensures a seamless experience for service providers. Historically, workspace interior providers have turned to tools such as AutoCAD, 3ds Max and even Excel spreadsheets to manage their operations. Officebanao is taking a stab at it through a tech suite that elevates the industry standard, the startup says. This suite features an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that supplants traditional spreadsheet usage, an innovative technology layer that integrates seamlessly with AutoCAD to grant clients straightforward access and a proprietary 3D solution capable of previewing an astonishing 10,000 options for boardrooms or meeting spaces in mere seconds, Officebanao co-founder and CEO Tushar Mittal said in an interview. Mittal co-founded Officebanao in January 2022 with Akshya Kumar (CTO) and Divyanshu Sharma (CBO and CPO) after spending years in the industry designing and building workspaces for multinational clients at real-estate developer DLF and interior design firm SKV. The founders’ experience and know-how about the market have helped bring a competitive edge to the startup against the competition, they say. “There is a huge demand… but the only problem is it is not vertically integrated anywhere. So, people are going here and there and not getting a one-stop solution,” he said while answering how Officebanao stands differently. The level of transparency the startup offers to its clients and supply chain also makes it different from the other players in the market, he added. Officebanao currently has customers in more than 15 cities, including in some of the untapped tier-2 cities of the country. Over the next few months, the startup is looking to expand to the top 25 markets. It also leverages platforms such as LinkedIn and Instagram to attract new customers in different markets. The startup plans to deploy the all-equity seed funding and partnership from Lightspeed India Venture Partners to expand its headcount from the current 110 to 250-300 people by the end of the year to create a solid technology-driven foundation and better meet the demand. Mittal told TechCrunch that Officebanao has a revenue run rate of around $5 million per quarter and is improving every quarter. The startup was all bootstrapped until now. “Officebanao is a mission-driven company, committed to making a meaningful difference in how workspaces are developed in India. We are delighted to partner with them and are excited to see how they transform this market,” said Rahul Taneja, partner, Lightspeed, in a prepared statement. “With depth of experience and supplier network, the team is best placed to disrupt the existing opaque and sub-par experience that plagues the industry today. It is encouraging to see the early progress, the sustainable business model and most importantly, the customer delight they have delivered – and we look forward to their continued expansion.”"
167,How much does your company pollute? CarbonChain gets $10M Series A to help answer that,['@tdechant'],"April 25, 2023","Everything you buy and every service you pay for pollutes. In the case of a coffee, it might be a little. In the case of a Chevy Suburban or a flight to Durban, it might be a lot. Exactly how much, though, isn’t easy to determine. That’s in part because hardly any companies comprehensively track their emissions — just 10% log or estimate carbon pollution across all phases of their products or services, according to the Boston Consulting Group. Some of that might be because some companies are opposed to carbon accounting, but in many cases, they simply lack the expertise to do it right. Ignorance won’t get them far for long, though. In January, the EU started requiring companies to disclose their carbon emissions, and in the U.S. the SEC is working on similar rules. Just as the SEC helped to standardize financial accounting over the last nine decades, government regulation promises to do the same for carbon disclosures. As governments have telegraphed their intent to regulate carbon accounting, a number of firms have sprung up to assist companies in the process. One of them is CarbonChain, which is announcing a $10 million Series A, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. The round was co-led by Union Square Ventures and Voyager Ventures. The startup has been cooking for a few years, co-founder and CEO Adam Hearne told TechCrunch+. It was part of Y Combinator’s spring 2020 cohort, and it has spent much of that time building a massive dataset that covers 80% of the world’s emissions, he said. “A lot of sources of emissions in the world are well known. If you think of refineries that have been around for 30 years, mines that have been around for 100 years, in some cases, ships that are 30 years old. There’s a lot of very predictable assets. And we know those assets individually really well.”"
168,Pitch Deck Teardown: Diamond Standard’s $30M Series A deck,['@Haje'],"April 13, 2023","When the financial markets go all wobbly, conservative investors turn to scarce resources that are unlikely to plummet in value, including things like silver, gold, palladium and platinum. Diamond Standard wants to add diamonds to that list and has created a blockchain-based system to create tokens that gives investors access to diamonds, much like how they trade other precious commodities, including through ETF-like structures on the stock market such as IAU, SLV and PLTM. The company is bullish on diamonds as an asset class: “Following 20% returns last year, the Diamond Standard Coin has continued to generate a positive return this year, while the S&P 500 is down 14% and bitcoin is down 50%. Investors need a new uncorrelated asset class, and this capital will enable us to increase capacity and expand our offerings,” said Cormac Kinney, the company’s founder and CEO, in a press release announcing its funding round last year. The Wall Street Journal, Coindesk and Alley Watch also covered the fundraise.   Diamonds are different from gold or silver, however. While gold is gold, it doesn’t matter what shape it is. As long as it is pure and can be melted, in theory, every ounce of gold is worth the same as every other ounce of gold. That isn’t the case with diamonds. The value of a diamond comes down to four qualities (known as the four Cs). I’ll let Tiffany’s nerd out here, but in short, it’s down to color, clarity, cut and carat (i.e., size). This means it’s hard to make an index fund of diamonds, because they differ in four different dimensions, and one diamond can rarely be swapped like-for-like with another. For all of those reasons, I got super curious when Diamond Standard submitted its deck for review a while ago. Today, it’s time to take a closer look! We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.  Diamond Standard has an 11-slide deck, and it says it submitted the deck exactly as pitched for its $30 million round. When you look at the full pitch deck, note that the numbering on the slides isn’t consistent (there are two slides numbered “4” in the lower right-hand corner and no slide 6). So in the list below I am using the PDF page numbers. For those of you who’ve been following the full pitch deck teardown series, you may have noticed that there’s quite a lot of information missing from this deck, even just based on the list of slides. I’ll get to that in a moment because we do have some highlights to celebrate first. I often advocate for a strong slide 1+2 combo to set the tone for a pitch. Diamond Standard takes that to the next level by putting its mission on the very first slide. It’s a refreshingly direct way to start: [Slide 1] Solid opener! Image Credits: Diamond Standard
Diamond Standard’s choice to put its mission front and center is a solid one. It lists its core mission (“To benefit investors by establishing diamonds as a liquid hard asset like gold.”) and then goes into some of the more tactical aspects of what it’s doing: creating digital assets that can be used to create fungible diamond commodities, enabling liquidity and creating diamond-backed futures, options, funds and exchange-traded securities. [Slide 1] Solid opener! Image Credits: Diamond Standard There’s a lot going on on this slide and I’m sure designers would have a thing or two to say about how it’s put together. But it accomplishes something really important: It explains with great clarity the what and how of the company’s planned operations. That’s a hell of an accomplishment for a complex business such as this, and putting that information front and center is downright inspired. Remember what I said about diamonds being different and, therefore, hard to commoditize? Diamond Standard has a solution: It puts a bunch of diamonds into a single coin or bar and claims that averages out the diamonds’ value, making each unit fungible. In other words: Every unit should be worth as much as every other unit. [Slide 3] Making diamonds fungible. Image Credits: Diamond Standard
Diamond Standard’s way around the individuality of diamonds is pretty clever. Instead of arguing over the individual value of a diamond, it simply heaps a bunch of diamonds together, puts them into a single unit (called a coin or a bar) and slaps a blockchain token onto the unit. The bars of diamonds are kept in a CME-approved storage facility, and the bars and coins can be sold based on who holds the digital tokens. [Slide 3] Making diamonds fungible. Image Credits: Diamond Standard If you want your actual bar or coin, you can request it to be shipped to you so you can bury it in a hole in the ground behind your house, keep it in a safe or juggle them while giggling maniacally. Again, this slide isn’t going to win any prizes for design (What are all of those arrows for? Why so much text?), but it does have a major benefit: It explains how the company solves one of the core problems with turning diamonds into a tradable standard without having to go through an inspection by a balding, belouped diamond expert called “The Head.” I also hereby admit that all my knowledge of the diamond trade is from watching “Snatch” a couple hundred times, so perhaps take that part of my commentary with a couple pinches of diamond dust. As I am writing this, the diamond-encrusted stones are worth $5,280. The bars are worth an order of magnitude more.

Image Credits: Diamond Standard’s website, via screenshot For Diamond Standard to make sense, you have to believe three things: [Slide 4] Opportunities galore. Image Credits: Diamond Standard
If I were to summarize this slide, I’d say “A rising tide raises all boats, and a tide is a-coming.” [Slide 4] Opportunities galore. Image Credits: Diamond Standard If (and that’s the big “if” here) Diamond Standard can convince investors that this is a new commodity worth trading, it’s easy to see that there’s a huge market available for the picking here. For starters, there will be a speculative opportunity as the market picks up, and once it saturates, there will be an ongoing opportunity for buy-and-hold investors — the same category of investors who buy precious metals. What you can learn from this slide is that if you can visually align yourself with a competitive alternative to a few huge, well-established markets, you’re in a really interesting and compelling position as a potential investment. It’s mind-boggling to me that Kinney’s five years of experience in the jewelry industry didn’t warrant a mention on the team page of a company that’s doing something related to … diamonds. I’m not gonna lie, there is a lot that I absolutely detest about this deck. The design is awful. There’s a lot of data missing, and based on this deck alone, I suspect the company would’ve had to suffer through a long and painful due diligence process to raise its funding. Having said that, the company did raise $30 million from an illustrious group of investors (co-led by Left Lane Capital and Horizon Kinetics) and I suspect that the opportunity was simply too big to let a subpar deck get in the way of an investment round. In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Diamond Standard could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck! "
169,Praktis lands $20M to help Indonesian D2C brands handle their supply chains,['@catherineshu'],"May 5, 2023","Small to medium-sized enterprises contribute 60% of Indonesia’s gross domestic product. But companies in the D2C space still struggle to compete against bigger brands. Praktis wants to put them on a more level playing field. The startup, which handles everything from raw material purchases to order fulfillment for D2C brands and suppliers, announced today it has raised $20 million in Series A funding. The round was led by East Ventures (Growth fund), with participation from Triputra Group and SMDV. Praktis co-founder and chief executive officer Adrian Gilrandy told TechCrunch that even though 60% of Indonesia’s GDP comes from SMEs, many experience difficulties while scaling up their business operations. These include finding reliable suppliers, getting fair pricing, the cost of labor and high exposure to fixed costs. Praktis’ team. Image Credits: Praktis Praktis’ team. Image Credits: Praktis Through its platform, Praktis’ customers are able to manage this business operations, including raw material purchases, production, fulfillment and logistics. Gilrandy said Praktis also aggregates purchasing and processing for economies of scale. This leaves D2C brands free to focus on other parts of their business, including brand building and marketing. The startup plans to scale up by growing alongside the D2C brands it serves. Gilrandy said its ecosystem can easily be applied to other verticals — for example, it started in fashion before moving on to the beauty industry. Praktis claimed 12x growth year-on-year from 2020 to 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of its services, and 4x growth year-on-year from 2021 to 2022. Praktis will use its new funding for technology development for both brands and suppliers, building its team and expanding its end-to-end supply chain ecosystem. The startup also announced today it has appointed Leonard Pontoh as its chief financial officer. Pontoh is also joining its board of directors. In a statement, East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Willson Cuaca said, “We are thrilled to double down our investment to Praktis as they strive to empower D2C brands in Indonesia and hit profitability much faster than we expected.”"

171,"From DrakeGPT to Infinite Grimes, AI-generated music strikes a chord",['@asilbwrites'],"April 26, 2023","Last week, a song using AI deepfakes of Drake and the Weeknd’s voices went viral, but neither major artist was involved in its creation. Meanwhile, Grimes has taken to Twitter to offer 50% royalties on any AI-generated song that uses her voice, then declared that she is interested in “killing copyright,” which would probably undermine her ability to collect royalties in the first place. We might be living in the weirdest timeline, but unless Grimes is working on any secret inter-dimensional transit projects (you never know), the music industry has to reckon with what to do next. Musicians like Holly Herndon and YACHT have embraced AI as a tool to push the limits of their creativity. YACHT trained an AI on 14 years of their music, then synthesized the results into the album “Chain Tripping;” Herndon created Holly+, a website that freely allows anyone to create deepfake music using her own voice. While Herndon may openly invite people to experiment with AI art using her likeness, most artists don’t even know that people can model their voice before it’s too late. Therein lies the problem. In Spotify’s recent quarterly earnings call, CEO Daniel Ek spoke about the company’s approach to AI-generated music. Despite Spotify taking down “Heart on my Sleeve,” the AI song that uses deepfakes of Drake and the Weeknd, Ek seems cautiously optimistic about the fast-developing technology. “[AI] should lead to more music,” Ek said on the call. “More music, obviously, we think is great culturally.” For a big business like Spotify, that might be true: If more people use their streaming service to listen to more music, then they get more money. But for many artists and music fans, AI poses a threat. “When artists are already struggling, it seems like a dangerous step,” entertainment lawyer Henderson Cole told TechCrunch. Between abysmal streaming payouts and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the live music industry, musicians have been having a rough go of it, to say the least. Now, like visual artists, these performers have become guinea pigs for technology that appropriates their work without consent. “Music has a special social role in the development of technology,” Erickson told TechCrunch. “It can be attached to any kind of emerging technology as a way of providing a use case or selling general interest and attracting investment.” We saw this happen with the crypto industry, which at one point seemed poised to change the status quo of music royalties and ticketing, but has yet to reach anything close to mass adoption. Sometimes these new technologies do take hold, though. As a historical example, Erickson points to sampling, or the practice of iterating on snippets of other artists’ work in new recordings. So long as a musician gets permission from the artist and their label, sampling is fair game. “It was centered in community rather than the technology itself,” Erickson said about sampling. Of course, in cases where music was sampled without the artists’ consent, some high-profile lawsuits ensued. Now, it’s only a matter of time before we see rights holders get over AI-generated music. Under certain circumstances, copyrighted material can be used without explicit permission if it is considered “fair use.” Fair use analysis considers whether a work was created for profit, the amount of copyrighted material it uses, how transformative it is and if it might economically impact the original. Though a fair use argument could be constructed in favor of AI music, Cole thinks it’s doubtful that it would hold much weight in practice. “In a world where Ed Sheeran and Robin Thicke are getting sued just for sounding similar to a hit song, someone using AI to copy an artists’ voice or musical sound seems unlikely to be allowed,” Cole said. It takes a long time for the legal system to catch up with new technology, but for now, major labels like Universal Music Group (UMG) have spoken out in opposition to the use of generative AI. “We have a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” a UMG representative said in a statement. The representative said that the rise of AI-generated music “begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation.”  "
172,Ask Sophie: How do we transfer H-1Bs and green cards to our startup?,['@Sophie_Alcorn'],"April 5, 2023","Here’s another edition of “Ask Sophie,” the advice column that answers immigration-related questions about working at technology companies. “Your questions are vital to the spread of knowledge that allows people all over the world to rise above borders and pursue their dreams,” says Sophie Alcorn, a Silicon Valley immigration attorney. “Whether you’re in people ops, a founder or seeking a job in Silicon Valley, I would love to answer your questions in my next column.” TechCrunch+ members receive access to weekly “Ask Sophie” columns; use promo code ALCORN to purchase a one- or two-year subscription for 50% off. Dear Sophie, I was recently laid off. I’m co-founding a cleantech startup with two of my former colleagues, who were also laid off. Both of my co-founders are on H-1Bs and had green cards in the works with our former company. I’m a U.S. citizen. What do we need to do to transfer their H-1Bs and green cards to our startup? Based on your experience, do investors care about the amount of money a startup spends on visas and green cards for their founders? — First-time Founder Dear First-time, Congrats to you and your co-founders on dreaming big and taking the leap to create your own startup! I appreciate your dedication to the environment, your tenacity, and your spirit of innovation. Let me take your second question first. Based on my experience, the majority of U.S. investors who invest in my international founder clients tend to be interested in whether the startups have an innovative idea with some initial traction, a strong founding team and are structured as a Delaware C-corporation. Many investors I’ve worked with have been very supportive of immigration efforts that keep founding teams and key talent together in the United States to build and scale their startups, even if that means paying higher wages than typical for founders in the startup market to ensure compliance with various immigration requirements.

(opens in a new window) That said, you can broaden your funding sources by considering grants, particularly since your focus is cleantech. The big benefit of grants is that they are non-dilutive capital. And they don’t require repayment like a loan. You have a contract with deliverables that you as startup founders define. What’s more, grants and other funding can help your co-founders qualify for an EB-1A extraordinary ability green card, which I’ll discuss in more detail in a bit. These funds can also be used to pay your co-founders’ legal and filing fees for their H-1Bs as well as their H-1B salaries. Now let me dive into your initial question, starting with H-1B transfers. As you and your co-founders know, they have a 60-day grace period from their last day of employment in their former H-1B role until they have to leave the U.S. or apply for another status. Transferring your co-founders’ H-1Bs to your startup is definitely possible, but you’ll want to start immediately. It’s important to take the steps necessary to qualify your startup for sponsoring the H-1Bs before proceeding with the transfer. And it’s important to take those steps quickly since the 60-day grace period for your co-founders is already counting down."
173,"Meta beats revenue expectations, remains committed to metaverse",['@asilbwrites'],"April 26, 2023","Things are looking up for Meta. The company beat revenue expectations, reporting an increase in year-over-year revenue for the first time in three quarters. But this ray of light for the company formerly known as Facebook comes amid harsh restructuring, resulting in more than 10,000 jobs eliminated this year. Tech moves through buzzwords like clockwork. Though the metaverse was all the rage when Meta changed its name — a sort of recursive and self-referential generation of hype — now, it’s all about AI. Despite big losses in its metaverse investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it a point to tell investors that he is not making a u-turn into the AI lane. Rather, he sees AI as technology that works in tandem with the metaverse. “A narrative has developed that we’re somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision, so I just want to say up front that that’s not accurate,” Zuckerberg said. “We’ve been focusing on AI and the metaverse, and we will continue to.” Image Credits: TechCrunch Image Credits: TechCrunch Meta isn’t expecting Reality Labs to make money yet, but investors have voiced concerns that this hefty investment might not pay off. Zuckerberg’s interest in ongoing AI development might quiet some of those worries — Meta’s stock price has increased, for one — but the metaverse is still bleeding money. Reality Labs, Meta’s department for VR and AR, lost nearly $4 billion this quarter. In all of last year, it lost $13.7 billion. Zuckerberg pointed out, though, that VR and AR technology do in fact involve AI. “Our vision for AR glasses involves an AI-centric operating system that we think will be the basis for the next generation of computing,” Zuckerberg said on the call. When it comes to its metaverse vision, Zuckerberg said that half of daily active users on its Quest headsets spend more than one hour per day on their device. Meta did not disclose just how many people are actually using Quest headsets on a daily basis. “Building the metaverse is a long-term project, but the rationale for it remains the same, and we remain committed to it,” Zuckerberg said.

But first, let me dive into a few things you should know, starting with your grace period. Image Credits: Joanna Buniak / Sophie Alcorn

(opens in a new window) You get a 60-day grace period when your F-1 STEM OPT expires. Please keep in mind that you cannot work during the 60-day grace period. This grace period is not to be confused with the 60-day grace period typically utilized by people in H-1B status. The purpose of a student F-1 grace period is to give you time before you must depart the United States to either: Let me dive into some of the nitty gritty of this list: The tech job market worldwide can feel tough right now. The number of people laid off in the tech industry so far this year has already surpassed all of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi. In 2022, 164,511 people lost their jobs. So far this year, more than 183,000 people have been laid off in the tech industry. Given this, you may want to consider continuing your education as an F-1 student by enrolling in a full-time degree program. Typically, curricular practical training (CPT) is available at some universities and colleges. CPT enables an F-1 student who has been enrolled full time for at least one academic year and has not yet graduated to work, but some programs offer “day-one” CPT. Keep in mind that working for one year of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours of work per week) means you won’t be eligible for optional practical training (OPT). Working part time under CPT (20 hours per week or less) means you will still be eligible for OPT and possibly another two-year STEM OPT extension if your degree is on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s STEM Designated Degree Program List."
175,Paytrix raises $18.3M to build out its one-stop payments shop,['@ingridlunden'],"March 29, 2023","Payments remains one of the most fragmented of online services, a situation that is only compounded when your business trades internationally. A UK startup called Paytrix says it has raised $18.3 million to build a solution to fix this: a single platform — and single contract — that lets its customers manage all of the different payments options from payment acceptance to payouts, in one place. The funding is a Series A and it is being co-led by Unusual Ventures, Motive Partners and Bain Capital Ventures. Bain had also been a part of Paytrix’s previous round of £5.2 million in May 2022 with Fin Capital, Better Tomorrow Ventures, Hambro Perks, ClockTower Ventures, The Fintech Fund, D4 Ventures and various individuals, all of whom are also participating in this round. The company is not disclosing its valuation. Aran Brown (CEO), Ed Addario (CTO), and Edward Harrison (CPO) co-founded Paytrix with collectively decades of experience at a range of well-known payments, FX, and other fintech companies, and that might be the key to why it’s been able to raise this money right now, in the most bearish of venture markets in years, and during a much tighter market in e-commerce overall. The service doesn’t have its full scope of licensing in place yet — there are plans in place both for an EMI for the UK and Europe. Brown said that Paytrix has a Payments Institution license in the UK already approved by the FCA, “which is being upgraded to an EMI… alongside a separate application for an EMI in Ireland with the CBI.” Both were applied for last year and “are progressing well” with a team in place to support that, including the former Head of Authorisations at the CBI as its Chair, and the former chief compliance officer of Square International. Paytrix describes itself as a “payments curation” platform, and behind an API that it provides to its customers to integrate into their own services, Brown says, it negotiates its own banking relationships in different countries, which lets it bypass the traditional payment rails used for card payments and other payment services like Stripe, as well as some of the newer channels that have been emerging in more recent years, such as open banking standards. As Brown describes it, Paytrix integrates directly with local payment schemes through tier-one banks or locally integrated payment partners. Some of these are disclosed — it uses Modulr Financial in the UK — and some, Brown says, in the EU and APAC “we are contractually restricted from naming them.” As Paytrix is acquirer-agnostic, he said, merchants continue to work with card acquirers such as Stripe or whichever service is used, and Paytrix provides local accounts, real-time FX and instant settlement “to the sellers and downstream beneficiaries” to take care of payouts. The company is focusing on payouts now: it processes these currently in 133 currencies and 200+ countries, including real-time FX. He says that this arrangement cuts down on the number of third-parties that merchants or marketplaces typically have to work with, relationships that typically introduce not just costs but complexity and questions with buyers who are transferred to third-parties to make payments. Paytrix doesn’t handle incoming payments yet, and it works with any acquirers its customers already use, whether that involves open banking or another provider. That will be “Phase 2” for the company, Brown said: “Enabling global collections which will allow merchants to collect funds in each of the markets they operate in without the burden of identifying, sourcing and contracting with the local banks, or waiting to have sufficient volume to work with a tier-one bank. This will then be followed by other payment options such as direct to card, and virtual card issuance.” Whether all of this will work as advertised is still to be seen, of course. Paytrix “does have a number of customers,” Brown said, but it’s not allowed to disclose most of them. One is Fyorin, a business banking platform that provides various financial services to businesses. Another is Cardstream, a payment gateway in Europe. Others include a European ticketing marketplace and a global “employee of record” platform (for managing and working with employees in international markets), Brown said. More generally, Brown said that the company is targeting not just e-commerce companies, but also others that need to make and manage payments (accepting and making them) across multiple countries, such as payroll providers. The e-commerce opportunity is an interesting one: it’s not targeting the top tier of players like Amazon, which build and manage its own services, but hundreds of online retailers and marketplaces that have more than $1 million in annual revenues but not the resources to manage multiple supplier relationships on an operational or technical level. Typically, Paytrix said that its customers on average manage between 10 and 15 payments suppliers, so the pitch is that this can now be taken down to one. But given the persistent problems in the market and the track records and experience of the team here, it’s a bet that investors believe is a strong one to make. “Paytrix is addressing a critical need for businesses operating in an international marketplace,” said Matt Harris, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, in a statement. “The complexity and cost of cross-border payments has long been a major pain point for companies looking to scale, and Paytrix’ solution neatly tackles these challenges. We believe there is a global need for this kind of payments infrastructure and we’re excited to continue our support of Paytrix as they expand their solution to businesses around the world.”"
176,"In edtech, history matters: Reach Capital just closed its largest fund to date",['@nmasc_'],"April 10, 2023","Reach Capital, one of the first venture firms to focus exclusively on edtech, closed its last investment vehicle during an unprecedented boom within tech. The San Francisco-based venture firm saw an increase in digital infrastructure, remote learning and society’s ever fickle attention as an opportunity — and unsurprisingly, those same tailwinds then helped Reach close its largest fund to date. Fast-forward two years, we’re now in a different world, socially, politically and technologically. Beyond the fact that no one is talking about Zoom school or learning pods anymore, edtech startups raised $10.6 billion last year, down 49% from the year prior. So, has edtech’s venture pitch changed? “I think the fact that edtech may not be in the news so much anymore, it’s a good thing,” says Esteban Sosnik, partner at Reach Capital. Repeating the common adage of other investors these days, he says that there’s never been a better time to start a company. In education specifically, he adds, less capital means less competition: Iif you manage to build something, there’s 10 times more likely that you will have success.” Less capital for some is a win for others: Reach announced today that it has raised its largest fund to date, a $215 million investment vehicle to back early-stage startups based in the United States and abroad, with a specific eye on Latin America. It has also closed a $4 million sidecar fund, dubbed Reach Founders Fund, which brings together capital from 40 portfolio companies. As mentioned, the new capital was raised against a very different backdrop from the prior fund; but the team says history makes a difference. “There were a lot of fly-by, tourist investors that came into the space over the last two, three years, so having a fund that has been long standing investor prior to the pandemic seemed to be a real value proposition and work in our favor,” Wayee Chu, co-founder of Reach Capital, said. Chu said that LPs also resonated with the “educated bench” of investors at the firm, which bring together over 20 years of public school experience. Not much is changing for Reach Capital’s strategy between funds (Chu says that edtech valuations are starting to come down to March 2020 levels). But what’s old doesn’t mean they’re going to ignore what’s new: exuberance around artificial intelligence. Reach Capital has made around five investments in AI companies since starting the firm, but given the boom in the space and recent technological advancements with ChatGPT, the firm is eagerly looking at net new startups to back. Chu tells TechCrunch that they are currently in due diligence with four AI startups. “We’re seeing a lot of technology in search of a solution,” Chu said, saying they prefer “founders who start with the actual pain point and solution and then decide which technology enablement will solve that — we’re seeing a lot of fun new tech, but it still seems to insert something not deep enough of a pain point.” Reach’s Sosnik, meanwhile, wants to remind founders that AI isn’t new. The investor urges founders to focus on collaborating with researchers, unique data moats and measurable impact. As he wrote recently, “As we’ve seen from the rollercoasters of crypto, metaverse and VR, adoption hinges on whether or not the product delivers better experiences and outcomes. More simply put: How is AI making lives better?” Ironically enough, the same question he sees as vital for AI is the same question that edtech success has always hinged on: Can it work for the right people, at the right time, in the right, most equitable way?"
177,"Slack backs Videowise’s approach to creating interactive, shoppable videos",['@christinemhall'],"March 27, 2023","The concept of “shoppable videos” has been around for at least a decade, with some big companies, like Showroom, Firework, Vimeo, YouTube and Klarna getting in on the action. There have also been startups embracing this space that have received some attention from investors in the past, like Cinematique, which gave it a go in 2017, Clideo and, more recently, Kahani, which doesn’t exactly describe itself as doing “shoppable video,” but its concept of content videos for e-commerce brands can certainly be considered adjacent. The latest attracting investor attention is e-commerce video platform Videowise, founded by Romania-born product designer Claudiu Cioba in 2021. The company now has a cash infusion of $3 million in a round that closed earlier this year. Slack Fund led the round and was joined by Founder Collective, Underline Ventures, MuVentures, Ratio Ventures, Stan Chudnovsky, Javier Olivan, Ed Baker, Scott Belsky and Gokul Rajaram. The new investment gives Videowise a total of $4.1 million in venture-backed funds, Cioba said in an interview. After working for over a decade in product design for companies, Cioba decided to embark on his own entrepreneurial journey, focusing on e-commerce. In talking to founders in the sector, he learned that the “North Star” for driving sales was conversion rate. “If you can create a product that can affect the bottom line of these e-commerce operators, you could find product market fit quite easily,” Cioba said. Though video creation and video consumption on sites like TikTok and Instagram took off during the global pandemic, many e-commerce brands had a “very basic video experience, very horizontal and traditional, nothing that was customizable,” he said. Cioba said he saw an opportunity to build a better product that was specifically designed for direct-to-consumer brands and online retailers. In 2022, Videowise launched its video platform product that helps online stores manage and publish videos, at scale, on an unlimited number of product pages, collection pages or blogs, versus one video per page like other companies. What differentiates Videowise from some of its competitors, like Vimeo or Firework, is its swipe-up video playlists and infrastructure that Cioba said offers automation and insights from advanced video analytics while also protecting page speed. Videowise is able to deliver loading times up to five times faster than traditional video players, he added. The company’s first integration was with Shopify, where the concept has caught on: Videowise is currently working with more than 600 Shopify and Shopify Plus brands. It has generated over $1 million in added revenue from purchases happening straight in its video player and driven over $25 million in revenue at conversion rates of up to 328% since 2021 from video shoppers spending up to four minutes more per page, Cioba said. One of Videowise’s customers is handmade soap company Dr. Squatch, which, after switching to Videowise, saw a 3.2% increase in revenue per session in the first 30 days, he said. Meanwhile, Cioba intends to use the new funding to add more employees — the company has 30 today — and continue developing its technology stack with a focus on omnichannel video shopping experiences. He also wants to expand outside of Shopify and is now trialing with new Salesforce Commerce Cloud stores. “We had no revenue last year and were struggling at the beginning of last year, but after we redesigned our marketing site and started working with mid-market and large brands, we saw a big revenue increase, around 500%, we started consulting with investors,” Cioba said. “There’s still a lot of innovation to be built and a ton of functionality being asked of us. New feature releases will be coming this year in areas where we don’t see competitors currently focused, and we aim to be a platform that can integrate with anyone.”    "
178,Twitter seemingly now requires all advertisers to have a verified checkmark,['@psawers'],"April 21, 2023","As Twitter’s legacy blue check mark system finally comes to an end, the social network’s new paid-for verification system is causing more than a little chaos, with CEO Elon Musk himself stepping in to pay for some celebrities’ verification when they refuse to do so. However, another little nugget to emerge from the carnage today is that anyone looking to advertise on Twitter will now seemingly have to have a verified account. Several Twitter users, including social media guru Matt Navarra, have posted screenshots of an email reportedly sent by Twitter, which states that starting from April 21 (today), verified checkmarks are required to continue running ads on the platform. The email reads: Building a better Twitter through verification Hello! Starting April 21, your @account must have a verified checkmark or subscribe to either Twitter Blue or Verified Organizations to continue running ads on Twitter. Business accounts spending in excess of $1000 per month already have gold checks or will soon, and they’ll continue to enjoy access to advertising without interruption at this time. This change aligns with Twitter’s broader verification strategy: to elevate the quality of content on Twitter and enhance your experience as a user and advertiser. This approach also supports our ongoing efforts to reduce fraudulent accounts and bots. Subscribing to either of these services means you have been verified by Twitter as a real person and/or business. Amongst other features, you’ll have a more visible organic presence and a broader range of creation tools. We’re excited for you to get started and to benefit from a superior Twitter experience. For Twitter Blue, sign up here. For Verified Organizations, apply here. While Musk has been pushing subscriptions as a core money-driver as advertisers fled the platform, it’s clear that Twitter still wants (and needs) advertising dollars. The platform’s top advertisers, those spending $1,000 each month, already receive an official gold check-mark gratis, indicating that they are an official business account. There is nothing official yet on Twitter’s ads account pages to indicate that only verified accounts will be able to advertise, but there is some sense in requiring verification for advertisers if it reduces spam or deters other bad actors from the platform. However, for this to be properly effective, it would surely need rigorous vetting beyond requiring a credit card and phone number, while the $8 monthly fee is not a major deterrent in itself. Moving forward, it seems that anyone wanting to post an ad or promote a tweet will have to cough up $8/month for Twitter Blue, or $1,000 per month to be recognized as a verified organization. One exception here will likely be accounts with a grey checkmark, which are reserved for official government and related accounts, such as agencies, embassies, parliaments and so on. At any rate, it’s difficult to see how this move will do anything other than dissuade advertising spend on Twitter. TechCrunch reached out to Twitter for comment, but at the time of writing we have yet to receive a response (aside from the customary poop emoji, of course)."
179,Covariant’s CEO on building AI that helps robots learn,['@bheater'],"March 28, 2023","Covariant was founded in 2017 with a simple goal: helping robots learn how to better pick up objects. It’s a large need among those looking to automate warehouses, and one that is much more complex than it might appear. Most of the goods we encounter have traveled through a warehouse at some point. It’s an impossibly broad range of sizes, shapes, textures and colors. The Bay Area firm has built an AI-based system that trains network robots to improve picks as they go. A demo on the floor at this year’s ProMat shows how quickly a connected arm is capable of identifying, picking and placing a broad range of different objects. Co-founder and CEO Peter Chen sat down with TechCrunch at the show last week to discuss robotic learning, building foundational models and, naturally, ChatGPT. TechCrunch: When you’re a startup, it makes sense to use as much off-the-shelf hardware as possible. PC: Yeah. Covariant started from a very different place. We started with pure software and pure AI. The first hires for the company were all AI researchers. We had no mechanical engineers, no one in robotics. That allowed us to go much deeper into AI than anyone else. If you look at other robotic companies [at ProMat], they’re probably using some off-the-shelf model or open source model — things that have been used in academia. Like ROS. Yeah. ROS or open source computer vision libraries, which are great. But what we are doing is fundamentally different. We look at what academic AI models provide and it’s not quiet sufficient. Academic AI is built in a lab environment. They are not built to withstand the tests of the real world — especially the tests of many customers, millions of skills, millions of different types of items that need to be processed by the same AI. A lot of researchers are taking a lot of different approaches to learning. What’s different about yours? A lot of the founding team was from OpenAI — like three of the four co-founders. If you look at what OpenAI has done in the last three to four years to the language space, it’s basically taking a foundation model approach to language. Before the recent ChatGPT, there were a lot of natural language processing AIs out there. Search, translate, sentiment detection, spam detection — there were loads of natural language AIs out there. The approach before GPT is, for each use case, you train a specific AI to it, using a smaller subset of data. Look at the results now, and GPT basically abolishes the field of translation, and it’s not even trained to translation. The foundation model approach is basically, instead of using small amounts of data that’s specific to one situation or train a model that’s specific to one circumstance, let’s train a large foundation-generalized model on a lot more data, so the AI is more generalized. You’re focused on picking and placing, but are you also laying the foundation for future applications? Definitely. The grasping capability or pick and place capability is definitely the first general capability that we’re giving the robots. But if you look behind the scenes, there’s a lot of 3D understanding or object understanding. There are a lot of cognitive primitives that are generalizable to future robotic applications. That being said, grasping or picking is such a vast space we can work on this for a while. You go after picking and placing first because there’s a clear need for it. There’s clear need, and there’s also a clear lack of technology for it. The interesting thing is, if you came by this show 10 years ago, you would have been able to find picking robots. They just wouldn’t work. The industry has struggled with this for a very long time. People said this couldn’t work without AI, so people tried niche AI and off-the-shelf AI, and they didn’t work. Your systems are feeding into a central database and every pick is informing machines how to pick in the future. Yeah. The funny thing is that almost every item we touch passes through a warehouse at some point. It’s almost a central clearing place of everything in the physical world. When you start by building AI for warehouses, it’s a great foundation for AI that goes out of warehouses. Say you take an apple out of the field and bring it to an agricultural plant — it’s seen an apple before. It’s seen strawberries before. That’s a one-to-one. I pick an apple in a fulfillment center, so I can pick an apple in a field. More abstractly, how can these learnings be applied to other facets of life? If we want to take a step back from Covariant specifically, and think about where the technology trend is going, we’re seeing an interesting convergence of AI, software and mechatronics. Traditionally, these three fields are somewhat separate from each other. Mechatronics is what you’ll find when you come to this show. It’s about repeatable movement. If you talk to the salespeople, they tell you about reliability, how this machine can do the same thing over an over again. The really amazing evolution we have seen from Silicon Valley in the last 15 to 20 years is on software. People have cracked the code on how to build really complex and highly intelligent looking software. All of these apps we’re using is really people harnessing the capabilities of software. Now we are at the front seat of AI, with all of the amazing advances. When you ask me what’s beyond warehouses, where I see this going is really going is the convergence of these three trends to build highly autonomous physical machines in the world. You need the convergence of all of the technologies. You mentioned ChatGPT coming in and blindsiding people making translation software. That’s something that happens in technology. Are you afraid of a GPT coming in and effectively blindsiding the work that Covariant is doing? That’s a good question for a lot of people, but I think we had an unfair advantage in that we started with pretty much the same belief that OpenAI had with building foundational models. General AI is a better approach than building niche AI. That’s what we have been doing for the last five years. I would say that we are in a very good position, and we are very glad OpenAI demonstrated that this philosophy works really well. We’re very excited to do that in the world of robotics."
180,GitLab’s new security feature uses AI to explain vulnerabilities to developers,['@fredericl'],"April 24, 2023","Developer platform GitLab today announced a new AI-driven security feature that uses a large language model to explain potential vulnerabilities to developers, with plans to expand this to automatically resolve these vulnerabilities using AI in the future. Earlier this month, the company announced a new experimental tool that explains code to a developer — similar to the new security feature GitLab announced — and a new experimental feature that automatically summarizes issue comments. In this context, it’s also worth noting that GitLab already launched a code completion tool, which is now available to GitLab Ultimate and Premium users, and its ML-based suggested reviewers feature last year. Image Credits: GitLab Image Credits: GitLab The new “explain this vulnerability” feature will try to help teams find the best way to fix a vulnerability within the context of code base. It’s this context that makes the difference here, as the tool is able to combine the basic info about the vulnerability with specific insights from the user’s code. This should make it easier and faster to remediate these issues. The company calls its overall philosophy behind adding AI features “velocity with guardrails,” that is, the combination of AI code and test generation backed by the company’s full-stack DevSecOps platform to ensure that whatever the AI generates can be deployed safely. GitLab also stressed that all of its AI features are built with privacy in mind. “If we are touching your intellectual property, which is code, we are only going to be sending that to a model that is GitLabs or is within the GitLab cloud architecture,” GitLab CPO David DeSanto told me. “The reason why that’s important to us — and this goes back to enterprise DevSecOps — is that our customers are heavily regulated. Our customers are usually very security and compliance conscious, and we knew we could not build a code suggestions solution that required us sending it to a third-party AI.” He also noted that GitLab won’t use its customers’ private data to train its models.  DeSanto stressed that GitLab’s overall goal for its AI initiative is to 10x efficiency — and not just the efficiency of the individual developer but the overall development lifecycle. As he rightly noted, even if you could 100x a developer’s productivity, inefficiencies further downstream in reviewing that code and putting it into production could easily negate that. “If development is 20% of the life cycle, even if we make that 50% more effective, you’re not really going to feel it,” DeSanto said. “Now, if we make the security teams, the operations teams, the compliance teams also more efficient, then as an organization, you’re going to see it.” The “explain this code” feature, for example, has turned out to be quite useful not just for developers but also QA and security teams, which now get a better understanding of what they should test. That, surely, was also why GitLab expanded it to explain vulnerabilities as well. In the long run, the idea here is to build features to help these teams automatically generate unit tests and security reviews — which would then be integrated into the overall GitLab platform. According to GitLab’s recent DevSecOps report, 65% of developers are already using AI and ML in their testing efforts or plan to do so within the next three years. Already, 36% of teams use an AI/ML tool to check their code before code reviewers even see it. “Given the resource constraints DevSecOps teams face, automation and artificial intelligence become a strategic resource,” GitLab’s Dave Steer writes in today’s announcement. “Our DevSecOps Platform helps teams fill critical gaps while automatically enforcing policies, applying compliance frameworks, performing security tests using GitLab’s automation capabilities, and providing AI assisted recommendations – which frees up resources.”"
181,Cerbos takes its open source access-control software to the cloud,['@psawers'],"April 12, 2023","Cerbos, a company building an open source user-permission software platform, has today announced a new managed cloud service and a fresh $7.5 million in seed funding. Founded out of London back in early 2021, Cerbos exists in a space broadly known as identity and access management (IAM), a $13.4 billion market that’s expected to nearly double within five years. IAM constitutes a collection of technologies that authenticates users and controls who can access which features of a particular system (if at all) — some users within a company often require different access rights to their colleagues in a different department, geography or seniority level. Specifically, Cerbos serves as the “AM” in “IAM,” enabling developers to introduce access management features to their software while continuing to use any third-party identity provider they wish, such as Okta / Auth0 or WorkOS. Cerbos’ two founders Emre Baran and Charith Ellawala met at a previous U.K. startup co-founded by Baran called Qubit, which was later acquired by Coveo. Between them, Baran and Ellawala have worked on various data infrastructure projects at companies, including Google, Elastic and CGI, where they say they encountered the same issues with developers having to continuously write their own authorization code. And it’s here that Cerbos is seeking to make its mark. At its core, Cerbos is all about decoupling the authorization process from an application’s main codebase, making it easier to scale their access management system as a company as its software evolves — this is particularly important as companies transition from monolithic software to microservices. In its short life so far, Cerbos has been an entirely self-managed product. With Cerbos Cloud, which is rolling out today in private beta, Cerbos is making the deployment and management of companies’ authorization policies and logs easier. This will be particularly useful for less-technical users, as it allows them to adjust policies through a central control plane without dabbling directly with any code, while developers themselves won’t have to maintain their own CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous deployment) pipelines. Ultimately, it all boils down to saving developers time so they can work on more differentiated product features. “What Cerbos Cloud unlocks is the ability to collaborate and iterate faster on policy development using visual tools and the ability to distribute optimized policy bundles to your fleet with low-latency and high-visibility,” Cerbos co-founder and CEO Emre Baran explained to TechCrunch. “Cerbos Cloud is an attractive option for companies and teams that don’t want to invest time and effort into building CI/CD pipelines for policy distribution.” Cerbos Cloud. Image Credits: Cerbos Cerbos Cloud. Image Credits: Cerbos Cerbos had raised a $3.5 million seed round some 18 months ago, and with its $7.5 million extended seed round, it has attracted a slew of new institutional and angel investors, including Omers Ventures; Chime co-founder Ryan King; former Palo Alto Networks’ CMO Zeynep Inanoglu Ozdemir; early GitHub engineer Zach Holman; Warp founder Zach Lloyd; and Brevan Howard Digital CTO Lewis Tuff. In the intervening months since its previous raise, Baran said that Cerbos has released some 19 iterations of its core platform, culminating in today’s Cloud launch, a move representing the company’s first attempt at monetizing the open source project. For the beta launch, Cerbos is dabbling with different pricing levels, but broadly it’s based on monthly active “principals” that are authorized, a principal meaning either a human or another machine that is seeking access to a particular access-controlled system. With its latest cash injection, Cerbos is well-financed to not only build out Cerbos Cloud toward its full commercial launch, but also lay the foundations for an enterprise-grade Cerbos incarnation. “We’re focusing on Cerbos Cloud first, and will use the learnings and feedback to design our enterprise product,” Baran said."
182,Google tests a new ad slot on the Play Store ahead of its I/O developer conference,['@sarahintampa'],"April 27, 2023","Google has been spotted testing a new Play Store ad slot ahead of its I/O developer conference in May. If rolled out publicly, the change could significantly expand the company’s Play Store search ads business by offering developers access to new prime real estate for their app marketing efforts. The test comes two years after Apple made a similar move with the addition of a new ad slot that appeared on the store’s Search tab itself, instead of only at the top of search results, as before. Similar to Apple, Google is also testing an ad slot that appears when Android users navigate to the Play Store’s search menu, where they can type in keywords to find apps. The test was first spotted by the Android news site, Android Police, which noted that Google had been testing app “recommendations” in this slot as of late last year. When queried about those app promos at the time, Google had clarified they weren’t ads, just personalized suggestions. Now, that’s changed as the same spot includes both app recommendations and suggestions that are actually labeled as ads. (A few examples can be found in this Twitter thread here.) The ads aren’t yet showing for everyone, however, which indicated this was likely a test, as Google has since confirmed. Users have reported seeing the test in multiple markets worldwide, so it’s not a U.S.-only update. Yes.
Google Play Store is showing ads in search bar. pic.twitter.com/Pmf0Q1EPb8 — Sumanth 💐 (@sumanthmee) April 25, 2023  Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson confirmed the experiment by noting the company tests new features on the Play Store from time to time. However, they didn’t offer any further information about this specific ad test — a possible indication Google doesn’t want to spoil a planned announcement. Or perhaps, there’s no determination yet on an ETA for a public launch. “We regularly test new features and ad formats to improve app discovery for Play users and help developers reach their audience, but don’t have anything specific to announce right now,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. Finding a new way to pull in revenue from Play Store ads could help Google boost its bottom line at a time when it’s had to make concessions on Play Store commissions. Due to new regulations and pressure from lawmakers, Google has been rolling out third-party billing options to global markets, offering developers reduced fees if they don’t use Google’s own billing services. Spotify has been an earlier adopter of the program, and dating app Bumble is also planning to participate. The availability of new Play Store search ad slots could significantly impact Play Store revenues, if rolled out broadly. When Apple introduced new App Store ad slots last year in less prominent locations, experts forecast the change could generate another billion in revenue for the tech giant, for example. Google doesn’t break out the size of its own Play Store Ads business, but it’s also likely a sizable figure. Data from Statista had estimated Google Play generated approximately $48 billion in 2021 through mobile apps. However, unsealed court filings in a Google antitrust case revealed Google Play app store revenue hit $11.2 billion in 2019."
183,Forme Financial launches out of beta as Earned to help physicians manage wealth,['@christinemhall'],"April 6, 2023","Forme Financial, a wealth management platform for physicians, is emerging from beta with a new name and $12 million in Series A funding. Now called Earned, the New York-based company provides a “comprehensive wealth system” focused on the needs of physicians, which John Clendening, co-founder and CEO of Earned, said were unique and often complex, depending on the person’s career stage. Physicians spend around 10 extra years in educational training, so that reduces their career in terms of reaching retirement, Clendening explained. They exit college, often with an average of $300,000 in debt, and at the same time, get a 5x to 15x increase in their income following their residency or fellowship program. In addition, something he noticed in the last five years is a change in the way physicians think about job opportunities. For example, thinking more about what it means financially to take a new job, particularly if they are going from owning a practice to working for someone else. “That means a significant amount of financial complexity,” Clendening said. “Physicians work an average of 70 hours a week and are never trained in financial topics. Despite being in a very upper echelon of wage earners, one in four physicians retired in the last couple of years with $1 million or less in net worth. When they want to get some help for this, they face a system that is super one-size-fits-all. The so-called specialists or experts are totally silent and none of them talk to one another.”   Instead, Earned’s “proprietary wealth engine” combines a physician’s career journey with predictive technology to create data-driven financial recommendations across offerings like estate planning, taxes, debt management, insurance and investments. The company’s Certified Financial Planners are also able to help physicians understand the implications of important career decisions, including buying into private practice or selecting from multiple job offers. The company’s vision always included a name change at the Series A stage, but Clendening also explained that “Earned” had more resonance as it related to “the mindset physicians who see themselves as people who are really invested a lot in their career as their No. 1 asset.” Earned makes money in a couple of ways: charging customers a fee based on assets under management and earning a commission, for example, when customers choose to purchase items like insurance. Since its beta launch in May 2022, Earned is working with more than 100 physicians in 24 states with 71% of users logging in weekly. They have also saved an average of $77,000 in taxes, Clendening said. He declined to disclose details about the company’s revenue. Other banks and fintechs offer banking and other financial services for physicians; for example, Panacea Financial, PhysicianBanks.com and Laurel Road. However, Clendening said most just offer lending products and don’t look at the entire perspective of physicians. “There are some edge competitors that have certain aspects of what we do, it’s just not enough to have the sort of impact that we’re talking about,” Clendening said. “We are purpose-built exclusively for physicians, inclusive of career advisory, and alongside that, a full-stack approach. Think about like a toolbox: We have every single tool in the toolbox that’s needed to optimize their financial life. We stand alone in that regard. We are also leveraging deep tech to reliably deliver what we’re optimizing financially.” In addition to the name change, the company also announced $12 million Series A funding, led by Hudson Structured Capital Management and Breyer Capital, with participation from Juxtapose. This latest round brings Earned’s total funding to $18 million since it started serving customers in 2022. With this new round of funding, Clendening intends to invest in hiring and technology to add more tools and features to its wealth engine with a goal of becoming what he called “a one-stop shop for physicians.” It is also focusing on customer acquisition because each physician has a unique career journey that helps Earned get more examples of what’s going on in someone’s financial life, he said. Meanwhile, Clendening estimates the wealth management for physician space is around $13 billion in addressable market annually, and is still “wide open in terms of competition for this space.” He is also considering expanding to other high-earning healthcare professionals, like dentists, and to physician families. “Job one is to continue the work that we’ve done inside the physician vertical,” Clendening said. “We will go deeper and deeper inside the physician profession with a goal to, over time, become the only place that a physician would go for any sort of advisory relative to their financial life.”  "
184,3 recruiting metrics that can help startups make more data-driven hiring decisions,[],"March 31, 2023","Navigating the current economic storm, startup founders have to focus on the key resource for their early-stage startup to survive and grow — the people. The biggest difference, however, between hiring in a healthy economy and hiring now is that there’s no room for mistakes. According to Harvard Business Review, the price of a bad hire is 30%–50% of their salary, which can hit startup budgets hard in 2023. To make fewer mistakes, founders should adopt a more data-driven approach to hiring. A good start is to track these three metrics: Startup founders have to focus on the key resource for their early-stage startup to survive and grow — the people. Cost per hire is one of the most essential business metrics, which must be included in a company’s profit and loss report. It helps a recruitment team test different strategies, as well as spot areas where they can trim costs and optimize hiring. This metric is used to calculate the total expenses a company incurs to attract, recruit and onboard employees. To calculate cost per hire, you would add up all the direct and indirect costs of the hiring process and divide it by the number of hires made within a specific period. First, define the period. It can be a month, a quarter, half a year or a year. I track the cost per hire monthly to continually optimize the process. Second, tally up all expenses. Take into account the internal costs such as salaries and bonuses of recruiters, licenses for corporate email accounts, the cost of applicant tracking system software and LinkedIn Premium, and education courses for new employees. Also, include the external costs of job ads and referral programs, fees of staffing agencies, as well as background checks and relocation expenses. If your company spends $10,000 on recruiting per month and hires four people, the cost per hire is $10,000 / 4 = $2,500. For an early-stage startup, a reasonable cost per hire is valued between $3,000 and $5,000. A recent study says the average benchmark is $4,700. If the cost is over $6,000, it makes sense to review your strategy. To identify the stages incurring the highest costs and find ways to cut expenses, it’s essential to assess each recruitment stage. If candidates decline your offer, gather feedback about the reasons for rejection and conduct new research on market salaries — you may be offering too little. When you don’t hire frequently, outsourcing recruitment may be more cost-effective than handling all operational costs internally. Compare your current recruitment expenses to the pricing plans of recruitment agencies, which usually charge 15%-35% of a new hire’s annual salary."
185,Stability AI’s new model is slightly better at generating hands,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 13, 2023","Stability AI, the startup funding a range of generative AI experiments, has released a new version of Stable Diffusion, the text-to-image AI system that was among the first to rival OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Called Stable Diffusion XL, or SDXL, the new system — which is available in beta through DreamStudio, Stability AI’s generative art tool —  improves upon the original in key ways. Tom Mason, Stability AI’s CTO, says that it brings a “richness” to image generation that the old model (Stable Diffusion 2.1) lacked, with improvements most notable in applications like graphic design and architecture. “We’re excited to announce the latest iteration in our Stable Diffusion series of image solutions,” he said in a canned statement. “[It’s] transformative across several industries … with the results taking place in front of our eyes.” Setting aside the hyperbole, SDXL does indeed seem on a par with — and perhaps even better than — the latest release of Midjourney’s model, the model responsible for “Balenciaga Pope” (among other memes). While the previous version of Stable Diffusion and many other text-to-image systems struggle mightily to recreate certain anatomy, like hands, SDXL has no such trouble. The hands aren’t always… well, realistic. But they’re miles ahead of the nightmare fuel SDXL’s predecessor would often produce. SDXL handles hands better, but obviously not perfectly.

Image Credits: Stability AI Stable Diffusion 2.1 is clearly worse at hands, hands down. (I’ll see myself out.) Image Credits: Stability AI SDXL is supposedly better at generating text, too, a task that’s historically thrown generative AI art models for a loop. But it still has a ways to go if my brief testing is any indication. On the top, results from Stable Diffusion 2.1. On the bottom, outputs from SDXL. Image Credits: Stability AI On the top, results from Stable Diffusion 2.1. On the bottom, outputs from SDXL. Image Credits: Stability AI In a press release, Stability AI also claims that SDXL features “enhanced image composition and face generation” and doesn’t require long, detailed prompts to create “descriptive imagery,” unlike its predecessor. Moreover, SDXL has functionality that extends beyond just text-to-image prompting, including image-to-image prompting (inputting one image to get variations of that image), inpainting (reconstructing missing parts of an image) and outpainting (constructing a seamless extension of an existing image). As a wildcard, I tried to recreate the Balenciaga Pope meme with as short a prompt as possible: “Balenciaga Pope.” The difference in the results was starker than I expected, I must say, with SDXL posing runway models in what might pass for designer attire versus the straightforwardly religious-seeming apparel that the old Stable Diffusion conjured up. Once it exits beta, SDXL will be open sourced, Stability AI says, just like the previous iterations of Stable Diffusion. In addition to DreamStudio, SDXL is currently available through Stability’s API, also in early access. While generative AI art tech marches forward, tools like SDXL have landed companies in hot water over the way they’ve been built and commercialized. Stability AI is in the crosshairs of a legal case that alleges the company infringed on the rights of millions of artists by developing its tools using web-scraped, copyrighted images. Stock image supplier Getty Images has also taken Stability AI to court for reportedly using images from its site without permission to create the original Stable Diffusion. The open source release of Stable Diffusion has also become the subject of controversy, owing to its relatively light usage restrictions. Some communities around the web have tapped it to generate pornographic celebrity deepfakes and graphic depictions of violence. To date, at least one U.S. lawmaker has called for regulation to address the release of models like Stable Diffusion that “don’t sufficiently moderate content.” In response to the lawsuits, Stability AI recently pledged to respect artists’ requests to remove their art from Stable Diffusion’s training dataset, but that didn’t apply to SDXL — only the next-generation Stable Diffusion models, code-named “Stable Diffusion 3.0.” Artists have removed more than 78 million works of art from the training dataset to date, according to Spawning, the organization leading the opt-out effort. Legal challenges be damned, Stability AI is under pressure to monetize its sprawling AI efforts, which run the gamut from art and animation to biomed and generative audio. Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque has hinted at plans to IPO, but Semafor recently reported that Stability AI  — which raised over $100 million in venture capital last October at a reported valuation of more than $1 billion — “is burning through cash and has been slow to generate revenue.”"

If you’re looking for a recap of the week’s news in tech, you’ve come to the right place. It’s Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch’s regular recap column. Glad to have you. Before we get on with the meat of it, a PSA that tickets for TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 are available now. Disrupt, of course, is TechCrunch’s flagship in-person event, focused on founders, investors and the future of tech year after year. In San Francisco on September 19–21, expect to hear from thought leaders in the fields of AI, fintech, hardware, sustainability, SaaS, security and more. It’ll be well worth the trip. In the nearer term, tune into the next TechCrunch Live show, which will spotlight Cambrian BioPharma, a startup billing itself as a pharmaceutical outfit with a revolutionary approach to managing drug development. Founder James Peyer will be joined by Maryanna Saenko of Future Ventures, who invested in Cambrian’s Series A, B and C rounds. Now, without further ado! Elon exposed: Elon Musk tweeted a photo on Monday night that showed him logged into his Twitter account, advertising to content creators how they can activate monetization features on Twitter. Unfortunately for Musk, people weren’t paying much attention to the fact that he has 24.7K paid subscribers — instead, some users realized that he appeared to be logged into another account, Amanda writes — possibly his burner. Oops. SpaceX finds success in failure: SpaceX launched a fully integrated Starship launch vehicle for the first time last Thursday, a long-awaited and highly anticipated milestone in the vehicle development program. Despite its fiery fate, the test was a success, Aria reports: SpaceX got tons of valuable data that will inform future Starship and Super Heavy prototypes. Tile, but for cats: Tile, the AirTag rival now owned by Life360, this week launched a new cat-tracking tag to help pet owners find their furry friends. The new device, “Tile for Cats,” is essentially a modified version of the Tile Sticker with a silicone collar attachment that costs $39.99. Ivan has more. Epic loss: Apple has won its antitrust-focused appeals court battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games over its App Store policies, Sarah reports. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the district court’s earlier ruling related to Epic Games’ antitrust claims in favor of Apple, but it also upheld the lower court’s judgment in favor of Epic under California’s Unfair Competition Law. Holmes avoids prison: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes will not be heading off to prison this week to begin serving an 11-year sentence, as first reported by the WSJ. Though earlier this month U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila denied her request to remain free while she appeals her conviction, this week she asked the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals directly if she could stay out of prison while her case makes its way through the appeals process; the request automatically puts her reporting date on hold while the court considers her request, writes Connie. Protestors sting back: A Missouri government tip site for submitting complaints and concerns about gender-affirming care is down after people flooded it with fanfiction, rambling anecdotes and the “Bee Movie” script. The Missouri Attorney General’s office launched the online form for “Transgender Center Concerns” in late March, inviting those who’ve witnessed “troubling practices” at clinics that provide gender-affirming care to submit tips, Morgan reports. Twitter pushes advertisers to pay up: As Twitter’s legacy blue check mark system finally comes to an end, the social network’s new paid-for verification system is causing more than a little chaos, with CEO Elon Musk himself stepping in to pay for some celebrities’ verification when they refuse to do so. However, another little nugget to emerge from the carnage this week is that anyone looking to advertise on Twitter will now seemingly have to have a verified account, Paul reports. WhatsApp across devices: WhatsApp is finally rolling out multidevice login support for more than one phone. Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature’s rollout on Facebook and Instagram, clarifying that users can log into the same WhatsApp account on up to four phones. Until now, you could only use one WhatsApp account on one phone and multiple companion desktop devices. TechCrunch is cross-medium, in case you weren’t aware.

187,EV company Canoo agrees to $1.5M settlement with SEC,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 30, 2023","Electric vehicle startup Canoo has agreed to a $1.5 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a regulatory filing. The SEC began investigating Canoo in May 2021, just a few months after the company merged with special purpose acquisition company, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. The investigation covered Hennessy’s IPO and merger with Canoo, the startup’s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and more. It also delved into the departures of certain company officers, including co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz. Canoo shared the news Thursday as part of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings report. The company’s stock price, which closed Thursday at $0.62, tumbled nearly 10% after the bell. Canoo was one of several EV SPACs that incurred the investigative gaze of the SEC, including Lordstown Motors, Arrival, Nikola and Faraday Future. Canoo didn’t share many details about the SEC investigation, but the $1.5 million did show up on the company’s balance sheet for the fourth quarter. The EV SPAC is a pre-revenue company that has repeatedly warned it was low on cash and needed to raise more capital to stay in the game. Canoo did deliver its first Light Tactical Vehicle to the U.S. Army in the fourth quarter for a demonstration, but that contract is only worth $67,600 — not exactly a material amount given the company’s losses. In February, Canoo agreed to sell 50 million shares at a 16% discount, or $1.05 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering came in at around $52.5 million. That infusion of cash seems to be inadequate for getting Canoo to revenue-generating status. The company closed 2022 with only $36.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. With a Q4 net loss of $80.2 million ($487.7 million for the full year), the company will likely need to raise more money to cover whatever expenses come in Q1 alone. By the way, on a quarterly basis, that loss is smaller than the $138 million it clocked in Q4 2021. However, Canoo ended 2021 with a net loss of $346.8 million, so that’s a year-over-year increase of over 40%. Canoo said during Thursday’s earnings call that it was exploring diversified funding sources that it will announce over the next couple of quarters. Canoo’s CEO Tony Aquila noted that “legacy matters” like messy executive shakeups and the now-concluded SEC investigation made it difficult to file for funding from the Department of Energy’s loan program, for example. “Now our opportunities are exponential to access capital as we start to establish this management team’s track record,” said Aquila. Aquila is clearly trying to send a message to investors that Canoo’s problems are due to issues from past management teams. Aquila took over as CEO in 2021, and since then says Canoo shifted from a company that offered a single product to one with a “new business strategy” that includes on-shore manufacturing. Canoo also recently brought on Ken Magnet as its new chief financial officer and Tony Elias as its new EVP of operations. Hopefully, that’ll be enough to turn this electric ship around. Canoo reported adjusted EBITDA of negative $60 million in for Q4 2022 and negative $408.6 million for the full year. Last year, those numbers were negative $120 million and negative $332.6 million for Q4 and full year 2021, respectively. Canoo said it expects Q1 operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation) to be somewhere between $55 million to $70 million, with capital expenditures between $30 million to $45 million. “As we move through 2023, we are focused on bringing our facilities online, scaling production and aligning with our strategic distribution partners for our global expansion,” Aquila said in a statement. Canoo said it is getting close to starting production in Pryor and Oklahoma City, where Canoo is building an EV battery module facility and a vehicle manufacturing facility to bring its Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle and Lifestyle Vehicle SUV to market in 2023. Oklahoma provided Canoo with $400 million in incentives to build there and agreed in March to buy 1,000 Canoo EVs, but the state can always pull out of that agreement. Canoo in January also signed an exclusive distribution agreement with GCC Olayan for vehicles in Saudi Arabia, marking the company’s first phase of international expansion. Aquila said during Thursday’s earnings call that Canoo thinks it can reach a 20,000 run-rate exit for the year. The company claims it has had a 300% increase in orders this year, with around $2.8 billion worth of total orders."
188,AI-powered retina scanning startup Mediwhale raises $9M,['@kateparknews'],"April 18, 2023","Mediwhale co-founder and CEO Kevin Choi discovered that he had lost vision in nearly half of one of his eyes from glaucoma when he was 24, which is rare in young people. “I was devastated and could not believe this was happening to me,” Choi told TechCrunch. “There were no [initial] symptoms for me to recognize. If this had been diagnosed and treated early, I could have saved my vision.” This ordeal motivated Choi to start a company to help people detect health risks early, even before symptoms appear. Following his treatment, Choi and his doctor Tyler Rim, a vitreoretinal surgeon, founded Mediwhale in 2016. The Seoul-headquartered healthcare startup has built an AI-powered non-invasive retina scan to diagnose cardiac and kidney disorders and more diseases through its patients’ retinal photographs. Mediwhale’s first product is Reti-CVD, an AI-powered retinal diagnostic solution that assesses the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients. Choi told TechCrunch that early detection and assessment of CVD risks would let users start statin therapy early for CVD intermediate and high-risk groups. Mediwhale’s tech offers results in under a minute, according to Choi. Medical professionals typically use computerized cardiac tomography (CT) scans to predict CVD risk. Despite its accuracy, high-dose radiation exposure, a relatively high price and long wait times for final results are the drawbacks of a cardiac CT scan. Mediwhale claims its Reti-CVD precision matched cardiac CT scanning in predicting potential CVD risks, while avoiding radiation exposure entirely, and being accessible in primary care settings rather than in dedicated testing facilities. The startup’s primary targets are those who currently do not currently have cardiovascular disease but have the potential to develop CVD in the future, like diabetes and metabolic disease patients, Choi said. Mediwhale focuses on South Korea as a testbed before launching its service in the U.S. Just last week, Mediwhale’s Reti-CVD received a temporary reimbursement code for two years from the Korean national insurance government, Choi told TechCrunch. The latest approval comes roughly eight months after it earned medical device approval in August. In other words, health insurance covers Reti-CVD as doctors in primary care and hospitals officially use it to treat patients in South Korea for the next two years; afterward, Mediwhale must submit additional clinical data to get a permanent code. It expects to sell its product this summer in South Korea. Mediwhale recently closed $9 million in Series A funding, which brings its total to $12 million since inception. SBI Investment led the latest financing with new investor Woori Venture Partners and previous backers BNK Venture Capital, Innopolis Partners and IPS Ventures participating. Its Series A will enable Mediwhale to accelerate the commercialization of Reti-CVD, Choi said, adding that it aims to obtain U.S. FDA clearance and implement U.S. insurance coverage with a goal of final FDA approval by 2024. Mediwhale isn’t the only company doing work using AI in the medical diagnostics space. Alphabet’s Verily raised $ 1 billion to expand its data-driven healthcare products in 2022. Digital Diagnostics, formerly known as IDx, an AI-powered diagnostics company, secured $75 million in Series B financing led by KKR last year."
189,Upfront’s Kobie Fuller has designed an investment framework for modern enterprise software,['@ron_miller'],"April 11, 2023","Kobie Fuller, a partner at Upfront Ventures, had a notion that there are certain characteristics that every successful enterprise software company shares. You might think that’s not something that’s easily quantifiable or identifiable, maybe just something that any investor knows or senses when they see it. But Fuller decided to sit down and figure out what those elements were, and he has created a framework that he released today. What Fuller came up with is called FABRIC, a way to measure and understand which enterprise software companies are most likely to be successful. “Fabric represents my overall thesis for how I think about software, and where I’ll be investing for the next decade plus,” Fuller told TechCrunch. There are six components he thinks are important for companies to prioritize and stand out, including being fast, addictive, bold, rewarding, integrated and built on community. He says, while it’s not necessary that every company has every one of these attributes out of the gate, it gives him a basis for thinking about enterprise software companies he’s investing in. “It is about boiling things down in just common language and I’m putting it out there what anyone who’s building the next generation of enterprise software companies should be thinking about — and using it as a guide about how they’re just forming their business in their companies.” Fuller says with tens of thousands of SaaS companies out there now, and the number growing all the time, companies need to be thinking about how to stand out, and what makes buyers and users turn to one solution over another, and he believes that it has to be fast and fun to use, something users rely on and come back to. He uses the term addictive, but what he means is that the software has to be designed in such a way as to be useful and so easy to use that you just keep coming back, that you’ve designed the software in such a way that it turns the industry on its head. That incorporates those first three elements of being fast, addictive and bold. Beyond all of that, it has to give you payback, a reward; helping you complete a task faster means you’re getting your work done faster. It also has to integrate into your existing technology systems and your teams and workflows. Finally, there has to be this whole community around it that helps you and that you feel a part of because you use that software. All of this may sound like common sense, but building software that does all that is no easy task. Once you do, and you begin selling it inside the enterprise, you make it incredibly difficult to stop using it or to switch to another vendor selling a similar service because your users have completely bought into the idea of this product, this company. He says that one startup that really embodies this idea is Figma, the company that Adobe is trying to buy for $20 billion. “Figma embodies all these components of FABRIC — they’re fast, they’re addicting, they’re bold, they’re rewarding in terms of value. They’re deeply integrated, and they’ve done an incredible job and building community from day one,” he said. It comes down to documenting something Fuller has learned over the years as he’s built a company and been an investor. Prior to joining Upfront Ventures, Fuller was chief marketing officer at Revolve, an LA fashion e-commerce company. “We’re trying to apply some of these principles that we’ve learned across all facets of our overall background, experience, especially in the area of [working with] consumers and trying to distill it into something very simple, very, very potent, that anyone can get and then allow there to be a common language for creation of software,” Fuller said."
190,Apple’s newest feature helps solve App Store billing issues without bugging developers,['@sarahintampa'],"April 20, 2023","Apple is introducing a new feature that will reduce the burden on app developers when it comes to solving subscription billing issues. Often, when an app’s subscribers have a payment method that fails, they’ll turn to the app developer for help. But the developer doesn’t handle billing issues for their App Store apps — those are managed by Apple itself. This leads to some back-and-forth where the developer has to determine the problem and advise the customer on how to proceed so they can keep using the app. Now, Apple says a new feature will instead prompt users inside the app when their payment method fails, meaning they’ll no longer need to bother the developer for help with this common issue. The company announced in a blog post to its developer community that it will soon pop up a warning in a system-provided sheet inside the app that lets customers update their payment method associated with their Apple ID. The sheet advises the app’s user there “is a problem with your current payment method” and that they need to update it to “avoid interruptions to your subscriptions and purchases.” Users can then press the big blue “Continue” button at the bottom of the screen to proceed to update their method of payment — for example, entering the new expiration date for a credit card after the older one expires. There’s also an option to “Add Payment Method” to switch to a new card. Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple Even better, developers won’t have to make any changes on their end to support the feature, Apple says — it will roll out automatically starting sometime this summer. However, developers are now able to get familiar with the sheet in the sandbox environment, where they can simulate billing issues to see how the system responds. Developers will also be able to suppress the prompts using messages and display in StoreKit, if they choose. The new system complements other features Apple has built around subscriptions, including machine learning-powered payment retries and a Billing Grace Period that lets customers continue to access their subscriptions while Apple attempts to collect the payment. The feature will be a benefit to consumers and developers alike, as it will simplify the process of updating their payment method and free up the developer’s time to work on more technical issues. Of course, the launch also comes at a time when Apple is being investigated over antitrust issues due to its high App Store fees, which has led many in the developer community to want to handle their own payments directly, outside of Apple’s platform. By adding in a useful feature like this, Apple has a better chance at retaining smaller developers who want to eliminate the hassle of subscription management."
191,CMU taught a robot dog to walk a balance beam,['@bheater'],"April 14, 2023","While discussing humanoid robots not long ago, someone told me their main issue with the form factor is that — from an evolutionary standpoint — we’re not built particularly well. That’s not to say that our bodies haven’t served us well, of course. They’ve done the trick for a few hundred thousand years. It’s more that if you sat down with a talented product designer and asked them to whip up something from scratch, certain concerns would likely lead them in an entirely different direction. Balance is on that list. Again, we’ve done just fine for ourselves, all things considered, but if balancing was high on your list of priorities, you might opt for something with four legs and a lower center of gravity. This off-the-shelf dog robot is a perfectly fine place to start. The quadruped is plenty stable in its standard locomotion. As you’d likely expect, that changes quickly when you, say, stick it on top of a balance beam. That, however, is the sort of challenge you live for, if you’re a part of a lab like Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. “This experiment was huge,” says assistant professor Zachary Manchester. “I don’t think anyone has ever successfully done balance beam walking with a robot before.” As to why this is such a big challenge… for starters, these robots aren’t designed to do it. Again, if you’re that omnipotent designer, you’d add in more flexibility and counter balance, for starters. The solution the team landed on is that big backpack you see in the above photo. That’s a reaction wheel actuator (RWA) — something used to help control the altitude of satellites. “You basically have a big flywheel with a motor attached,” adds Manchester. “If you spin the heavy flywheel one way, it makes the satellite spin the other way. Now take that and put it on the body of a quadruped robot.” CMU notes: Manchester said it was easy to modify an existing control framework to account for the RWAs because the hardware doesn’t change the robot’s mass distribution, nor does it have the joint limitations of a tail or spine. Without needing to account for such constraints, the hardware can be modeled like a gyrostat (an idealized model of a spacecraft) and integrated into a standard model-predictive control algorithm. Why, you may ask, would anyone spend time developing such a thing? Aside from the obvious satisfaction of watching a dog robot walk a balance beam, the most immediate answer is search and rescue. That’s long been a key application for these sorts of robots — sending machines where you wouldn’t normally send humans. It’s easy enough to see why balance is super important in just such a scenario."
192,"Spotify is shutting down Heardle, the Wordle-like music guessing game it bought last year",['@sarahintampa'],"April 14, 2023","Spotify is closing down Heardle, the Wordle-inspired music guessing game it acquired last July for an undisclosed sum. Similar to Wordle, Heardle offers players six tries to guess a popular song — but instead of typing in different letters to form words, players listen to a song’s intro to guess the artist and title. At the time of its acquisition, Spotify said Heardle would remain free to play for everyone. Now the company says it will sunset Heardle on May 5, as it aims to focus on its other objectives around music discovery. The changes are being announced through an in-app message on the Heardle website. Image Credits: Heardle Image Credits: Heardle The decision to close Heardle, we understand, came about because Spotify wants to devote more of its energy toward music discovery through its recent app changes, not through Wordle-inspired gameplay off-platform. Last month, Spotify rolled out a significant redesign of its mobile app experience that introduced new TikTok-style discovery feeds for music and podcasts along with other features, like Smart Shuffle for playlist recommendations and a new podcast autoplay option, among other things. It also rolled out an “AI DJ” that figures out what sort of music users like, then plays those tracks for you. The feature also gets smarter over time the more you engage with it. In light of these updates, Heardle was no longer a major part of Spotify’s overall music discovery efforts. In addition, like many tech companies that have undergone belt-tightening measures like layoffs in recent months, there’s less of a financial incentive to dabble with side projects — including the likes of a fun music game, for instance. Heardle, however, had still been fairly popular at the time of its acquisition. According to data from web analytics firm Similarweb, the game peaked at 69 million monthly desktop and mobile web visits in March 2022. Just ahead of the Spotify deal, those visits had dropped to 41 million. The firm says visits continued to decline, which likely made Heardle’s ongoing maintenance no longer a solid bet for Spotify. Plus, with much of the Wordle craze also trending down after The New York Times bought the flagship word game in January of last year, Heardle’s own future prospects may have been dimming, too. We understand Heardle had maintained some of its loyal users after the deal closed, but Spotify wouldn’t comment on overall usage or repeat engagement with any specific metrics. However, it was only after Spotify learned how Heardle players were engaging with the game that the decision was made to focus the company’s investments elsewhere. In the game, after users guessed the song, they could click a button to listen to the full track on Spotify. It’s possible that not enough users did so, instead just exiting the game to play again later. In other words, Heardle didn’t ultimately help Spotify achieve its goals around improved music discovery. And with the redesign, much of what Heardle had to offer was now duplicating the company’s other music discovery features — and doing so outside of the Spotify app. Still, for those who loved playing Heardle, today’s announcement regarding the game’s imminent closure will not likely be welcome news. Except, perhaps, by those Forbes contributors who had to write up the daily answers and clues and by the numerous sites running Heardle clones. Spotify confirmed the game’s closure with a statement. “After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to say goodbye to Heardle as we focus our efforts on other features for music discovery,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. The website will display a banner to users alerting them to the shutdown coming May 5. We understand there was no team dedicated to working on Heardle so there’s no impact in terms of either employee cuts or reorganization. While Spotify is moving away from Heardle, it’s not necessarily giving up on other sorts of interactive experiences, we’re told. The company today offers its interactive AI DJ feature and other things like polls and Q&As, which lets podcast listeners engage with their favorite creators. It also will continue to invest in other gaming projects, like its Spotify island on Roblox, its in-app Gaming hub and other integrations with Xbox and PlayStation. Earlier this month, Spotify also shut down another side project with the closure of Spotify Live, its livestreaming app and Clubhouse rival.    "
193,TikTok questioned on ineffective teen time limits in congressional hearing,['@sarahintampa'],"March 23, 2023","In hopes of heading off concerns over the addictiveness of its app, TikTok earlier this month rolled out new screen time controls that limited minors under the age of 18 to 60-minute daily screen time limits. But in a congressional hearing today before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, TikTik CEO Shou Zi Chew was questioned on the new tool’s inefficiency, forcing the exec to admit that the company didn’t have data on how many teens were continuing to watch beyond the default limits. The line of questioning is notable because TikTok’s algorithm and vertical video-based feed are among the most addictive products to emerge from the broader tech industry in recent years. Each swipe on the app’s screen delivers a new and interesting video personalized to the user’s interests, leading users to waste an inordinate amount of time on TikTok compared with older social media services. In fact, a recent study found that TikTok was now even crushing YouTube in terms of kids’ and teens’ app usage in markets around the world thanks, in part, to its addictive feed.   The format has become so popular, it’s also since been adopted by nearly all other major U.S. tech companies, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snap. So an examination of any sort of addiction mitigation techniques is certainly warranted. That said, the time limit TikTok designed for teens is really more for show — it doesn’t actually prevent younger users from watching TikTok. A hard limit on TikTok viewing is still up to the teen’s parents, who would have to use the app’s included parental controls to set screen time and session limits. Otherwise, they could turn to other parental controls bundled with the mobile OS from Apple or Google or those from third parties.   In the hearing, Chew touted how TikTok was the first to launch a 60-minute watch limit for teen users, and had other teen protections, like disabled direct messaging for users under 16. He noted also that teen content couldn’t go viral on the app’s For You page, if the creator was under 18. However, when pushed on the teen time limit’s real-world impact, the exec didn’t have any substantial data to share. “My understanding is that teens can pretty easily bypass the notification to continue using the app if they want to,” suggested Representative John Sarbanes (D-Md.). “I mean, let’s face it, our teens are smarter than we are by half and they know how to use technology and they can get around these limits if they want to,” he said. Sarbanes is correct. There’s really nothing to bypassing the feature — it only takes a tap of a button before you’re returned back to the feed when your time limit is up. A more effective mitigation technique would actually force a teen user to take a break from the app entirely. This could better disrupt the dopamine-fueled addiction cycle by requiring a short time-out where they’d be forced to find something else to do than continue to scroll more videos. When asked if TikTok was measuring how many teens were still exceeding the 60-minute time limit after the new feature was added, Chew didn’t know and didn’t share any sort of guess, either. Instead, he avoided a direct answer. “We understand those concerns,” the TikTok CEO responded. “Our intention is to have the teens and their parents have these conversations about what is the appropriate amount of time for social media,” he added, noting that the app offered a Family Pairing feature that does enforce a real screen time limit. In other words, TikTok doesn’t think real teen protections are up for it to decide. To be fair, neither do any U.S.-based social media companies. They want parents to shoulder the responsibility. This answer, however, showcases how a lack of U.S. regulation over these platforms is allowing the cycle of app addiction to continue. If lawmakers won’t create rules to protect kids from algorithms that tap into human psychology to keep them scrolling, then it really will be up to parents to figure step in. And many do not know or understand how parental controls work. Sarbanes asked TikTok to follow up by providing the congressional committee with research on how the time limits were implemented, how they’re being bypassed, and the measures TikTok is taking to address these sorts of issues. In a further line of questioning, this time from Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), TikTok’s addictive nature of the app and the dangerous stunts and challenges it showcased were suggested to be “psychological warfare…to deliberately influence U.S. children.” While that may be a bit of a leap, it’s worth noting that when Carter asked if the Chinese version of TikTok (Douyin) had the same “challenges” as TikTok Chew also admitted he didn’t know. “This is an industry challenge for all of us,” he said. The TikTok CEO later reiterated how kids’ use of its app is ultimately up to parents. When responding to questions about the appropriate age for TikTok use, he noted there were three different experiences aimed at different age groups — one for under-13 year-olds, another for younger teens, and another for adults. As an interesting side note, where Chew is based in Singapore, there’s no under-13 experience available, meaning his own kids are not on TikTok.  “Our approach is to give differentiated experiences for different age groups — and that the parents have these conversations with their children to decide what’s best for their family,” Chew said.

194,Jack Dorsey thinks Elon Musk isn’t doing right by Twitter,['@etherington'],"April 29, 2023","Jack Dorsey has been using Bluesky, the app he partially funded that’s built upon a federated and open social networking protocol he advocates, to do some truth-telling about Twitter, Elon Musk and the decision to take the company private under the stewardship of the Tesla CEO. Dorsey admits that Twitter is faring poorly under Musk — but he also blames the board for forcing the sale, and says Twitter had few options as a public company that would’ve ended well. Dorsey responded to a question from Bluesky user Jason Goldman regarding whether he felt that Musk proved the “best possible stewed [sic]” (it’s okay Jason we all make typos and we know you meant steward) with the following: No. Nor do I think he acted right after realizing his timing was bad.
Nor do I think the board should have forced the sale. It all went south. But it happened and all we can do now is build something to avoid that ever happening again. So I’m happy Jay and team and nostr devs exist and building it. Washington Post writer Will Oremus then quoted that post and attempted to frame it as Dorsey avoiding blame himself, which Dorsey strongly objected to, noting that he has previously apologized for his role in Twitter’s fate plenty. In addition to lamenting Twitter’s state under Musk and the circumstances that led it there, Dorsey also shared his opinion that Twitter “never would’ve survived as a public company,” suggesting that market conditions combined with the state of the company at the time meant it was destined for manipulation by activist investors and PE firms angling to take it over. Dorsey also re-contextualized his now-infamous tweet claiming that “Elon is the singular solution I trust,” clarifying that he meant specifically for the outcome of taking Twitter private (presumably versus other activist hedge fund investors).   Dorsey also took issue with the accusation that he “sold out” in selling the company to Musk, which is a flippant accusation for sure, but especially because, as Dorsey pointed out, public companies are inherently subject to sale and acquisition given the right (or wrong, I suppose, depending on where you sit) market conditions."

The same holds true for B2B SaaS startups: because so many are generally focused on LTV:CAC ratios, it can be a good way to obscure weak metrics. Dividing Customer Lifetime Value by Customer Acquisition Cost offers useful insights, but how accurate is your historical retention data, and how much have you collected?

Instead of drawing information from user interactions to create avatars representing actual customers, many teams will substitute their own judgment and guesses about what people like and dislike. Impartner VP of product Gary Sabin says his company “dove into the numbers” and “looked at 250 data points” to develop “persona-based services in implementation, customer support and customer success.” After a year, the company generated higher customer satisfaction ratings and NPS scores. “These personas work for us,” says Sabin. “Your customer data can lead you to create the personas that matter most in your customer base.”   Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch Considering how many startups emerge from colleges and universities, it make sense that so many academics end up in C-suites. But is that necessarily a good thing? Last week, at TechCrunch Early Stage, hardware editor Brian Heater spoke to SOSV general partner Pae Wu about partnering with teams that include professors and students. “There are some sectors where it can work very well to have members of your founding team who remain in academia,” said Wu. “We see this all the time in traditional biotech and pharma. But in other types of situations, it can become, frankly, a drag on the company and problematic for the founders who are full time.”   Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Dear Sophie, My STEM OPT expires in a month, and my company did not register me in this year’s H-1B lottery.

196,Meta’s ad business slapped with interim measures in France over suspected antitrust abuse,['@riptari'],"May 4, 2023","More regulatory woes for Meta: France’s competition watchdog has announced interim measures on the adtech giant — saying it suspects it of abusing a dominant position in the French market for ads on social media and across the broader (non-search-related) online ads market. It’s ordering Meta to suspend application of the current criteria it imposes for granting ad verification partnerships; and giving it two months to define and publish new rules for accessing and maintaining viewability and brand safety partnerships which the Authority specifies must be “objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate”. Meta must also have a transparent access procedure for the partnerships that is not based on an invitation it sends, the order also stipulates. The antitrust intervention follows a complaint by Adloox, a French ad verification platform that sells anti-ad-fraud and brand safety services. It complained to the Autorité de la Concurrence about Meta’s conduct between 2016 and 2022, accusing the company of denying it the same kind of access to its ecosystem that some of its competitors have been granted, harming its ability to provide its services.   Adloox claims Meta discriminatorily denied it access to the aforementioned viewability and brand safety partnerships — despite providing such access to other companies in similar circumstances. It also accuses Meta of abusing a dominant position by imposing unfair access conditions by providing only partial access to its ecosystem. And its complaint asked the Autorité to impose interim measures intended to force Meta to provide the sought for access. The French regulator, which has taken a preliminary view that Meta’s practices are likely to break competition rules, notes in a press release that Adloox’s last request to Meta, in August 2022, went unanswered. “The Authority considers that Meta’s practices are likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position,” the regulator writes in a statement [translated from French using machine translation]. “In light of the investigation, the Authority considered that Meta is likely to hold a dominant position on the French market for online advertising on social media as well as on the broader market for online advertising not linked to search. Given the importance of the advertising investments made on Meta’s platform, Meta is perceived as a key partner for independent auditors.” Practices by Meta that the regulator is calling out as likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position are 1): The lack of defined and transparent objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria for accessing and maintaining viewability and brand safety partnerships — with the Autorité saying the company integrated its current partners “following an opaque procedure initiated by Meta alone”. And while it notes Meta informed it of new eligibility criteria for the partnerships at the start of this year it points out these are still not public, nor do they appear to pass muster in other aspects, with the regulator pointing out they are still intended to be implemented as part of an (i.e. opaque) invitation system and suggesting they seem “both disproportionate and unjustified”. Secondly, the Autorité says Meta’s refusal of partnership access to Adloox is likely to be discriminatory, given its assessment that the third party is in an equivalent situation to others that have been granted access by Meta. The regulator says it’s acting under the French Commercial Code which empowers it to impose “precautionary measures” when it considers practices are causing serious and immediate harm “to the general economy, to the economy of the sector concerned, to the interests of consumers or, where appropriate, to the complainant undertaking”. In this case, it adds that it suspects Meta’s practices have caused “serious and immediate harm to the independent advertising verification sector by freezing the oligopolistic structure of the market”. “[A]ccess to Meta’s ecosystem is crucial for independent ad-verifiers, given the massive investment of advertisers in its inventories, but also the increasing demand from their clients for a single offer covering all online advertising channels,” it notes. “By creating artificial barriers to entry and expansion, such practices significantly hinder the development of the advertising verification sector and the incentives to innovate.” The Autorité goes on to state that it takes an even more serious view of Meta’s practices given they are taking place in a context where the market for independent advertising verification will soon be opened up — as the European Union’s Digital Market Act (DMA) starts regulating Internet gatekeepers in the coming months. Meta has not yet been designated a gatekeeper under the DMA, since the Commission has until early September to decide which core platform services fall under the regime. However the adtech giant is widely expected to face regulation as a gatekeeper. And while it remains to be seen exactly which of its services will make the cut, Meta’s ad platform seems highly likely to be designated as a core platform service under the DMA — which will require it to abide by a fixed set of operational obligations aimed at ensuring fair and open dealing. The French watchdog also points out that the DMA will set obligations on “the main advertising platforms” to provide free access to data necessary for independent verification of their inventories. So the measures it’s taking now, following Adloox’s complaint, appear to offer a taster of what the pan-EU regulation will soon be demanding of platform giants like Meta — but the difference will be it’s required up-front, rather than months (or years) after complaints about abusive behavior. The Autorité suggests Meta has caused “serious and immediate harm” to the interests of Adloox, by preventing it from providing its verification services on its platform — accusing it of depriving the third party of a major growth driver and likely causing it to lose clients. “It should also be noted that Adloox’s business has declined significantly since 2017, coinciding with Meta’s refusal to integrate it into its ecosystem, while the business of its integrated competitors has grown significantly. The refusal of access to Adloox could therefore lead, before the end of an investigation on the merits, to its eviction from the advertising verification market,” it adds. Meta was contacted for comment.     "
197,Muslims come into the frame in Southeast Asia’s fintech boom,['@catherineshu'],"April 27, 2023","Founded in 2014, Blossom Finance was first intended for Muslim entrepreneurs in the United States. The microfinancing platform connects investors with small businesses using mudarabah, a shariah-compliant profit-sharing agreement. But founder Matthew Joseph Martin soon realized that the startup, backed by investors like Boost VC and Tim Draper, was serving a relatively niche market in the States. So he started researching markets with large populations of Muslim people. Indonesia emerged as the best choice. Southeast Asia is already home to a thriving fintech scene, where Grab, GoTo and Sea have built super apps that encompass financial services, and startups like Xendit, Akulaku and Dana (to name a few) have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for payments, banking services and other financial tools. Indonesia and Malaysia, in the heart of Southeast Asia, are among the countries with the largest Muslim populations in the world. These factors are proving fertile ground for establishing and growing fintechs that focus exclusively on Islamic finance, offering products and services that follow shariah law. Among other things, this forbids accruing interest, speculation and financing non-halal products like pork, tobacco and alcohol. According to the World Bank, Indonesia has the most Islamic fintech companies in the world – perhaps fitting, since it’s also the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world with about 231 million Muslims. Some notable Islamic fintech companies include peer-to-peer lending platform and digital bank Hijra (formerly known as Alami), online bank Bank Aladin, LinkAja, which is backed by Telkomsel and Bank Mandri, the largest bank in Indonesia in terms of asset loans and deposits. Gojek’s GoPay is also partnered with the Indonesia mosque council to allow users to make zakat, or obligatory alms giving, online. Meanwhile in Malaysia, where 61.3% out of its 33.6 million inhabitants practice Islam, fintech companies that focus on Islamic finance include crowdfunding platform Ethis Ventures and investment platform Wahed, which is the only shariah-compliant robo-advisory platform in the country. Funding Societies, the SoftBank Vision Fund II-backed SME digital lending platform, recently launched a shariah-compliant financing product there, and now offers it as the default product to all its Malaysian customers. Shariah law calls for a different approach to financial services, and conventional banks are also launching products for Muslim customers. Along with the growing number of Islamic fintech startups digitizing the process, Islamic-compliant services are becoming accessible to more people. Profit sharing instead of debt The seed of Blossom Finance was planted when Martin was running a project in the U.S. enabling people to buy Bitcoin. He ran into a receivables problem, and the usual way to finance cash receivables is to get line of credit or receivables financing from a bank. As a practicing Muslim, however, Martin couldn’t use conventional loans. But he also couldn’t find any other options in the U.S. “Quite naively, I thought there are plenty of Muslims who own businesses, surely they face the same problem,” he said. “They must have a solution. So what is the solution?” After learning more about the principles of Islamic finance, Martin launched Blossom Finance, a platform that connects investors with microbanks, which in turn disburse shariah-compliant financing to microbusinesses. Headquartered in Delaware, Blossom Finance hosts investors from primarily the United States and Europe, but all of the microbusinesses it serves are in Indonesia. After initially soft-launching in the U.S., the Blossom Finance team realized that the market there for Islamic finance was very small, said Martin. They started looking for a bigger market, and landed on Indonesia because of the financial inclusion challenges facing micro and small businesses. Other reasons Blossom Finance chose Indonesia over other countries with large Muslim populations included its relative political stability, Martin said. It also has a strong baseline infrastructure for operating businesses with primarily foreign capital. “There’s already been over the past two decades prior to us arriving tons of amazing work,” Martin said. “A lot of the groundwork was already there and we were able to come in and operate as a connector where there are inefficiencies, and a lack of capital. We were able to bridge that lack of capital using a technology solution. All that underlying infrastructure for the last mile of serving the microbusinesses was already there and we were able to tap into it.” Investors on Blossom Finance’s platform pool their money into funds, or cooperatives, which are then managed by microbanks. The microbanks disburse the financing to microbusinesses to purchase inventory and other things they need. All losses and profits are shared pro rata, Martin explained. If an investor’s capital is 1% of a fund, they can expect to receive 1% of its profits, or absorb losses at the same rate. What makes Blossom Finance’s microfinance platform shariah-compliant is its use of murabaha contracts instead of traditional interest-charging loans. For example, when a microbusiness, like a corner store, needs to buy inventory like beverages or snacks, they go to one of the cooperatives for financing. Martin explains that the basis of the financing is not the capital, but the commodity that needs to be purchased. The cooperative purchases it at wholesale prices and provides it to the business at a markup instead of charging interest. They then share the profit with investors. Martin said cooperatives can often connect microbusinesses with wholesalers that they didn’t previously know, and also benefit from economies of scale, which also helps microbusinesses. An Indonesian warung, or small store selling snacks, drinks and daily use items (Gratsias Adhi Hermawan/Getty) An Indonesian warung, or small store selling snacks, drinks and daily use items (Gratsias Adhi Hermawan/Getty) Cooperatives don’t set prices, and instead mudarabah agreements are based on current market prices, which microbusinesses agree to. To make sure microbusinesses get fair agreements from microbanks, cost of funding for microbusinesses is one of the things Blossom Finance takes into consideration when deciding whether to work with a cooperative/microbank. “Let’s say you’re the bank and I want to buy chickens. You agree to buy me 100 chickens. Let’s say it costs $1,000. We will agree that your profit will be 20%, so I have to pay you $1,200 over the course of, say, 12 months. So you as the financier have that 20% profit,” Martin said. The advantage of working with cooperatives instead of commercial banks is that they provide more flexible payment terms and financing tenure, which is helpful if a business runs into financial difficulty, Martin added. Martin said there is discussion among Islamic scholars about whether or not profit-sharing is inherently better than debt. But, he asks, “if equity and debt are equal, why is it that the Prophet Muhammed prayed for protection from debt? I think we all inherently know the answer to that question, because debt can trap the poor in a cycle of poverty that they cannot escape. Equity, on the other hand, involves the concept of risk participation. Investors hopefully have a better upside, and the reason they get that better upside is because they’re participating equally with the entrepreneur in terms of risk.” Fostering financial inclusion A 2022 report by research firm DinarStandard and fintech Ellipses estimates that the market size of Islamic fintech in the Organisation of Islamic Coorporation (OIC) countries was $79 billion in 2021, making up 0.83% of global fintech transaction volume. While Islamic fintech’s market size is still small, it is expected to reach $179 billion at a 17.9% CAGR by 2026, outpacing traditional fintech’s 13.5% CAGR growth over the same period. DinarStandard and Ellipses also found that there are 375 Islamic fintech companies around the world. Most are in the P2P financing space, and Indonesia is one of the top markets in transaction volume. Islamic fintech startups in Malaysia and Indonesia have the support of government policies. For example, Indonesia’s National Islamic Finance Committee is focused on developing Islamic finance and the country’s Islamic economy. And in Malaysia, Bank Negara’s Investments Accounts Platform is the first Islamic P2P initiative established by a central bank, while the government-owned Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation connects investors with halal business owners. In 2019, the Malaysian government also issued its Shared Prosperity Vision 2030, a 10-year framework for restructuring its economy that includes building an Islamic fintech hub as a key part of its strategy. The World Bank has said that the growth of Islamic fintech can foster financial inclusion by giving unbanked people access to financial services. For example, one group of people it can reach are those who avoid bank accounts because their terms are not shariah-compliant, and want usury-free financial transactions based on risk-sharing. Islamic fintech can also help resolve issues that unbanked people face, like lack of money, lack of proper documentation and being located far away from conventional Islamic banks. Golden Gate Ventures partner Justin Hall, an investor in Hijra and Funding Societies, believes that Islamic fintech makes Islamic financial services accessible to more people. “Islamic banks are extraordinarily conservative, not only with how they operate, but the cost of financing, who they can lend to, etc.,” he said. “Having companies that differentiate from that and provide a nice consumer experience on the digital banking side, but within the framework of an Islamic bank, there’s an opportunity there.” The World Bank also says the Islamic microfinancing, or short-term financing with terms of less than 12 months, can play an important role in alleviating poverty in OIC countries since they work with customers who are often underserved by traditional banks. One example of a fintech company creating shariah-compliant products for underserved customers is Funding Societies, which is headquartered in Singapore with operations in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and Vietnam. Kien Poon Chai, the country manager of Funding Societies Malaysia, said its shariah-compliant financing product was launched in 2022 to serve relatively new micro- and small businesses, which are usually overlooked by banks when seeking working capital. Chai said the impetus for launching shariah-compliant financing products was because Malaysia has a large Muslim population and the company was seeing demand from lenders and SMEs looking for financing products in line with their faith. Funding Societies underwrites its shariah-compliant financing product in the same way as its conventional financing counterparts, but there are several nuances it has to pay close attention to. For example, financing cannot be used for non-halal businesses, including ones that sell alcohol, pork, tobacco or massage houses. Financial offers also have to be backed by underlying assets, so for every disbursement Funding Societies makes through its shariah-compliant product, it has to purchase underlying commodities through exchanges. Fee disclosures and charges also have to be shariah-compliant. There cannot be uncertainty in financing products, so all fees and charges must be clearly defined and outlined. For example, penalizing people for early repayment with prepayment fees is forbidden. Peer-to-peer lending without interest Another Islamic startup focused on financial inclusion is P2P lending platform and neobank Hijra. Founded in 2018, Hijra has raised $30 million in equity from investors like Quona Capital, Golden Gate Ventures and EV Growth. It first started as an aggregator of traditional Islamic banks serving SMEs, but co-founder and CEO Dima Djani told TechCrunch that after about 9 months, the team realized that the Islamic banking industry in Indonesia couldn’t keep up with the growth of fintech. As a result, Hijra got licensed by Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) in 2019 to operate as a digital lending platform. Then retail lenders began asking for more comprehensive financial services, so Hijra, then known as Alami (which is still the name of its P2P lending platform) acquired a small Islamic bank last year and launched a new digital bank with savings accounts and money transfers. The main reason Djani wanted to launch an Islamic finance platform is because Indonesia has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, but the penetration of Islamic finance was still very low, at about 6% to 7% of total banking assets, compared to about 30% penetration in Malaysia. Djani attributes this to low consumer awareness of Islamic finance, but says a new wave of religious teachers, who gain followers on social media, has given rise to a strong halal economy over the last 10 years and also spurred interest among millennial and Gen Z Muslims in adopting services that are tailored to their faith. In Indonesia, the guidelines for Islamic finance are determined by three authorities, said researcher Fahmi Ali Hadaefi. These are the Financial Services Authority (OJK), which regulates and supervises the financial services sector, Bank Indonesia, which oversees banks, and the Majelis Ulama Indonesia (National Sharia Board-MUI), or the country’s leading Islamic scholars body. The MUI has published at least two fatwas on fintech. The first, issued in 2017, is about Islamic perspectives on practices related to e-money. The second one, issued a year later with the Financial Services Authority, covers Islamic fundamentals for P2P lending. Since Muslims are prohibited from interest-bearing transactions, Hijra’s team wanted to provide an alternative for users in need of working capital financing. Like Blossom Finance, it uses a profit-sharing model to avoid interest. The way it handles P2P loans between lenders and farmers is one example. When a fish farmer needs to buy feed, they don’t take out a loan with interest from a lender. Instead, their lender buys fish feed and sells it at a profit to the farmer, with markups based on current market rates. Instead of paying for the feed immediately, farmers pay it off after harvesting fish in about three to four months. Islamic finance is meant to create a transparent and fair financial service for everyone,” said Djani. “For example, we view interest or usury as an unfair instrument on its mechanics. In addition, we also view that speculation and gambling as unfair, as they do not commensurate the effort and return evenly.” Harvesting fish on Ganga Island, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (Giordano Cipriani/Getty) Harvesting fish on Ganga Island, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (Giordano Cipriani/Getty) Hijra’s digital banking app, which it was able to launch after acquiring the small Islamic bank in Jakarta, doesn’t give any yield to depositors at the moment, but it also doesn’t charge them any fees. In the future, Hijra is planning to launch more sharia-compliant financial solutions, like rent-to-own, payments and community-driven savings for groups of people who have a common goal, like saving money for a trip to Mecca. Building a halal payment gateway Another example of a company founded to get more Muslims participating in digital financial services is PayHalal, which was created to provide a shariah-compliant online payment gateway. Co-founder Pat Salam Thevarajah told TechCrunch that he and fellow PayHalal co-founders realized in 2016 that if they wanted to get more people in the Muslim community to adopt online payments, they would have to build their entire tech stack from the ground up, instead of going to a white-label provider like Ayden. Thevarajah said that 55% of the Malaysian population is unbanked primarily because they fear riba, or interest. “We built it because of the pure necessity to create end-to-end compliance into the transaction. That’s how PayHalal came about. The primary objective is to keep payment free from riba and gharar, or speculation, so that Muslims are able to perform electronic payments in person or e-commerce without any form of non-compliance.” One of PayHalal’s goals is to create a network like Visa or Mastercard that stays true to Islamic finance principles. One key difference is the lack of interest. Conventional payment gateways treat money as a commodity, which means it can be sold at a price higher than face value or lent out with interest. PayHalal does not treat money as a commodity, instead only using it to purchase goods and services, and makes profit on the trading of goods or services. PayHalal makes sure its services are shariah-compliant with the help of two team members, scholar Dr. Daud Bakar and co-founder Indrawathi Selvarajah, who was a corporate lawyer before she became a shariah fintech specialist. Right now, when an instrument comes from a conventional financial institution, PayHalal feeds it into its AI-based non-shariah compliance screening tool. The tool then suggests treatment based on the amount of non-compliance factor, and PayHalal says that it takes the fee it earns on the transaction, writes it off and contributes it to social work, like feeding poor people or building mosques, as part of a process called purification. Thevarajah said the process is auditable because Islamic financial institutions have internal shariah compliance departments, which in turn undergo regular audits by external shariah supervisory boards. The process of identifying non-compliant transactions, writing off profits and donating fees is documented and reviewed by internal and external auditors for accuracy. Some examples of shariah non-compliant transactions include ones that involve the sale of forbidden items like alcohol, tobacco and pork. Transactions that involve riba or gharar are also considered non-compliant, and these can include interest charged on late payments or uncertain terms used in sales contracts. “There is no guarantee that we can keep riba away, unless it’s a closed-loop Islamic transaction,” said Thevarajah. “If it becomes an open-loop transaction, we are then required to do purification.” Cases of non-compliant transactions it tries to avoid include the exchange of goods for consumption that aren’t made with halal ingredients. Another is in cases of salaam contracts, where a buyer pays immediately for something that will be delivered at a later date. When that kind of transaction is handled by PayHalal, it mitigates chargebacks by making sure customers get their goods at the agreed upon time. “Transparency is fundamental with Islamic transactions,” Thevarajah said. One of PayHalal’s goals is to build a super app with different shariah-compliant financial services, like insurance products and saving accounts for pilgrimages to Mecca. It recently took a step toward expanding its product portfolio by launching a shariah-compliant buy now, pay later service with Atome. The BNPL program is interest-free and has no annual and servicing fees. It is currently onboarding merchants who offer halal and shariah-compliant services and products. Mecca during the Hajj pilgrimage (Reptile8488/Getty) Mecca during the Hajj pilgrimage (Reptile8488/Getty) Thevarajah explains that if a customer defaults beyond the three-month term of the loan, PayHalal can’t charge interest. Instead, it has to underwrite the entire transaction. “Our contract with the merchant would be active participation where we buy the product and we resell it to the consumer for the consideration of a fee,” he said, adding “The contract changes the entire structure of how an Islamic buy now, pay later operates.” Thevarajah added that transactions are structured as deferred payment sales, which means PayHalal, acting as the seller, buys the product for a supplier and then sells it to a customer at a profit margin. The customer than pays off the total price of the product in installments over a predetermined period of time. The transaction is asset-based, which means that it is secured against the product being sold, not the buyer’s creditworthiness. Still early days The rise of Islamic fintech in markets like Indonesia and Malaysia is tied to the growth of Islamic finance in Southeast Asia. According to a S&P report published last year, Southeast Asia’s $290 billion Islamic banking market is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of about 8%. In Malaysia, Islamic banks will make up 45% of the overall commercial banking loan book by the end of 2025, and in Indonesia, Islamic finance’s market share is expected to grow to 10% by the end of 2026, at a faster rate than conventional banks. But Islamic fintech still makes up a very small percentage of the total market. As stated earlier, DinarStandard and Ellipses estimate that the market size of Islamic fintech in was OIC countries was $79 billion in 2021, or just 0.83% of global fintech transaction volume. But that’s not stopping Hijra from making international expansion plans—the team already has an eye on Malaysia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Golden Gate’s Justin Hall, also an investor in Hijra and Funding Societies, believes Indonesia is uniquely positioned to be a starting ground for Islamic banks to expand to other markets around the world. “Indonesia is the only country today that has a confluence of operators that understand Islamic banking, as well as serial entrepreneurs, institutional LPs that are willing to capitalize companies that are doing that, and a very, very large domestic market. It’s very rare to find a model unique to Southeast Asia that can go global and I actually don’t know of any but Islamic fintech.” As Muslim fintechs create a more inclusive market landscape for Muslim users, they are also working on their own inclusivity issues, such as getting more women into the field of financial technology businesses. Djani said the rate of women working in Muslim fintech is still comparatively low, though some have promoted women to leadership roles, including Hijra’s chief financial officer Febriny Rimenta. One of the co-founders of PayHalal, Selvarajah, is a woman and Thevarajah said Muslim fintech startups can take several steps to get more women into the space, including building a gender-inclusive workplace based on Islamic values, providing flexible working arrangements, mentorship and promoting transparency to build trust with women employees. He added that Muslim fintech startups can design products, including savings and investment platforms, to increase women’s financial empowerment. Martin said the cooperatives Blossom Finance works with typically have a high representation of women, with one that is staffed completely by women. Barriers exist in other aspects of the space, too. On the fundraising front, Martin said one of the main obstacles he faced in the U.S. was educating investors. “First you have to explain what does Islam say and why is this even a problem, and then you explain your situation. So that was a challenge. However, I would say for VCs who were able to connect the dots and understand it was a genuine problem—there were some that did say, ok, maybe this is too niche and they passed—but for those who were able to take the time to understand the problem, we didn’t face any barriers.” Perhaps surprisingly, the most pushback he got was from other Muslims. “Where we did face barriers was within Muslims living as a minority in America. They pushed back against: ‘why are you calling this Muslim? Why are you focused on Islam?’” he said. “Very interestingly, the venture capital investors [who did back us] were like, this makes sense. This is an important niche. I think that goes back to being a minority and post-9/11, and being defensive. There is that resistance versus going to a Muslim-majority [market], where it’s like “well of course you’re doing Muslim finance, why wouldn’t you?” For Islamic fintechs, finding investors can also mean doing their own due diligence. PayHalal, which has received $4.5 million in seed funding from Asad Capital, Q Cap, Effective Shields and Crescent Capital, is now in the process of raising a $5 million Series A round at a valuation of $33.5 million. Thevarajah said part of fundraising means assessing potential investors to ensure both they and their fund management is done in alignment with shariah principles. “Investor interest in the Islamic fintech sector for PayHalal was very high due to its potential in a fast-growing Muslim population worldwide,” Thevarajah said. “While some investors viewed it as a captive market due to the religious beliefs of the Muslim community regarding halal food and transactions, we still had to ensure that potential investors fell within the fit and proper category for Islamic financial services.” Founders in countries with large Muslim populations say they also had to educate investors, but that is changing. The $30 million Hijra has raised in equity so far is almost all from non-Muslim countries. Djani said several of its investors already had a strong interest in Islamic financial services because it is a growing niche that is able to provide differentiation for fintech players. “We will need to do education on what we are offering, but dramatically less so over the past few years as Islamic finance has become more mainstream and widely accepted in Muslim-majority countries, like Indonesia,” he said."
198,Coinbase execs weigh in on the crypto’s future in US amid regulatory scrutiny,['@jacqmelinek'],"March 23, 2023"," Coinbase was issued a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, and executives from the company took to Twitter Spaces to discuss the decision and what Coinbase’s next steps will be to make legal frameworks for the crypto world. “Regulators should come up with the rules, tell everybody the rules and we follow them,” CEO Brian Armstrong said during the conversation. “The current laws are not clear and we would like to get more clarity.” Per a Coinbase SEC filing, the government agency’s staff has “advised the Company that it made a ‘preliminary determination’ to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company alleging violations of the federal securities law.” “I think it is easy to look at the situation right now and conclude that the SEC is trying to change the game,” Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, said during the Twitter chat. “What’s actually happening is the SEC is trying to cancel the game after it’s been played. And so we think it’s very important to keep a focus on what this means [longer term for Coinbase and the industry].” In the filing on Wednesday, SEC language appeared to indicate that staking through a third-party service can run afoul of securities law. But existing securities laws that were established roughly 90 years ago simply do not work for less intermediated digital assets that are utilizing innovative blockchain technology, said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation. “There are no current frameworks in the U.S., therefore, it is not possible for crypto companies to operate in the U.S. in a way that prevents them from facing regulatory repercussions,” she added."
199,Pet influencers are hotter than ever. But how do dogs do taxes?,['@asilbwrites'],"April 8, 2023"," A dog-tired husky with bright pink ears rests on the marble hotel floor, napping before his next meet-and-greet. Around him, the atrium echoes with the sounds of Louboutins click-clacking and businessmen chattering over overpriced cocktails. The stone resting spot isn’t as comfortable as the luxury pet bed he’s accustomed to, but the pup’s plush Louis Vuitton doggie vest cushions him as he recovers from the packed routine of an elite dog influencer. With over 7.5 million followers on TikTok, Swaggy Wolfdog is a full-blown celebrity — he (or at least his team) is used to getting approached by strangers, who might ask for a selfie. But as I approached the stylish pup and his handler, something possessed me. All I wanted to know was how an influencer dog — or its owner — files taxes. So, I asked. It’s a reasonable question. For a human influencer, making content and building an audience is only half the battle. To make a sustainable living, creators need to know how to run their own businesses, reckoning with questions about whether to get an EIN number, when to register an LLC, how to budget with a variable monthly income and how to file taxes. How much more complicated does the paperwork become when the breadwinner is moreso a bone winner? “The dog has his own LLC, and everything that the dog does, we write it off. From dog food to sometimes when we go out of town, he has his doggie hotel, and now, he has clothing,” said Aaron Phillips, a record producer who works with Swaggy Wolfdog’s owner, a musician named Swagrman. “All of his dog food, all of his friends’ dog food… and human food, because he likes chicken.”  Should we get swaggy his own star on Hollywood blvd!? @theblondejon ( Follow Swaggy On Insta ) ♬ original sound – SWAGGY WOLFDOG ™️💰  Swaggy’s situation isn’t like most influencer dogs. He’s fending off paparazzi on Hollywood Boulevard, throwing pool parties with a horde of bikini-clad models, getting chin scratches from the late Juice Wrld and hanging backstage at a music festival with star singer Camila Cabello. But filing taxes can be daunting even for pets who have thousands rather than millions of followers like Swaggy. To help manage emerging pet influencers, Harvard Law School graduate Loni Edwards founded The Dog Agency in 2015. “Back in the day, people didn’t think of it as a business,” Edwards told TechCrunch. But when her French bulldog Chloe became an early pet influencer, she saw an opportunity. “We were getting invited to these events in New York, and when people found out I was a lawyer, they were like, ‘Oh my gosh, I got this contract, can you help me out?’” Edwards said. “And so I was unofficially reviewing contracts with people, helping and guiding them.” Now, The Dog Agency is one of the top talent companies for pet influencers. But Edwards takes a more conservative approach to canine taxes than Swaggy’s team. Edwards points out that rules vary between U.S. states and that it’s best to consult a tax advisor when managing a small business. Still, she helps clients figure out which of their pet’s expenses can be considered a business cost. “If you have a car and you use it for work five days a week, you can write off that percent of time you’re using it for work. It’s similar with dog food,” Edwards explained. “If the pet is creating content and influencing half of the time, then [write-off] 50%.”  5 ways to make money with your pet!

A dog might not be typing away at a desk, but the dog’s owner probably needs dedicated space to shoot content, edit videos and store pet outfits and supplies. According to the IRS, a small business owner can deduct up to $1,500 for a portion of their home that’s used exclusively and regularly as an office. Someone who commutes to office space elsewhere would not be eligible, but you’d be hard pressed to find an Instagram famous puppy in a WeWork. If you’re buying an item specifically for a pet’s business, it’s more straightforward, Edwards said. If you’re going to dress your Golden Retriever in an “Airbud” costume for a Halloween-themed TikTok, then that dog-sized basketball jersey would count as a write-off. Once your pet ascends the ranks of the dog and pony show, you might consider how to register their business. According to Colleen Wilson, the owner of talent agency Pets on Q, most pet influencers don’t need LLCs until they’re making well over $100,000 per year. “On our roster of over 2,000 animals, you’d probably have under 10 that have an LLC set up,” Wilson told TechCrunch. Sometimes, creators set up LLCs for legal protection, but those concerns aren’t as relevant for an animal. Wilson said, “It ends up being a bit more work to set up as an LLC, because the risk of them being sued as a dog is like… what are you going to do there?” When it comes to taxes, Wilson points out that there’s a far simpler way to figure out what might count as a write-off. If you’re fostering an animal through a registered nonprofit, all unreimbursed costs for pet care are tax deductible. Beyond the dos and don’ts of tax deductibles, the pet influencer business gets even more complicated. “For tax purposes, we first have to figure out what their valuation is,” Wilson said.  Which Boobie Billie are you today? #fashion #fyp #backitupchallenge Video: Boobie Billie ♬ original sound – HYPEBAE  It might sound silly to quantify a dog’s business potential, but Pets on Q has its approach down to a science. Wilson explained that pets tend to have a lower return on investment in brand campaigns than a human influencer, so their rates for sponsored posts would be around a third lower. Animal influencers are cheaper because a pet generally doesn’t make as strong a case for buying something as a human can. Sure, Boobie Billie can model for Esquire and snag a partnership with Nordstrom, but she can’t tell you if her doggie Uggs run a size too big, or if her Old Navy dress is surprisingly preferable to her Gucci cardigan. If animal influencers aren’t as successful at sales, they can make up for it through sheer lovability. “People are less likely to hate them, like a Kardashian or a celebrity that could mess up in the future,” Wilson said. Your pet might never find themselves in the dog house after chastising American women for not working hard enough, but there are downsides. Pets generally do not have very long lifespans — a real tear-jerker of a business liability. Losing a beloved animal can be devastating, but that grief gets even more complex when that pet also brings home the bacon (but not literally, because bacon can cause vomiting in dogs and cats). Edwards experienced this first-hand when her dog Chloe the Mini Frenchie died from an unexpected medical error in 2017. Since then, she has repurposed Chloe’s Instagram to post about her new French bulldog dog, Emma.  🚨 a very important announcement about some very important names 🚨🥹 ♬ original sound – Jonathan  Last year, the beloved TikTok star Noodle the Pug passed away at age 14. The geriatric pup was frail in his old age, so he went viral in 2021 when his owner, comedian Jonathan Graziano, created a game called “bones or no bones.” If Noodle could stand on his own (he had bones), that would signal a good day — but if he didn’t have the strength (no bones), then maybe it was a universal sign to wear comfy pants and stay inside. Edwards represented Noodle, but she doesn’t think that Noodle’s passing will pose a financial roadblock for Graziano. Graziano’s children’s book about Noodle is already a New York Times’ best seller, and he has another Noodle book coming out soon. “It’s just as much Jonathan as it was Noodle,” Edwards said. “So there is longevity there, and Jonathan is getting ready to foster and bring in new senior rescues, so he’s staying on brand with the theme of the account.” Pet influencing is a dog-eat-dog industry, but Wilson tries to maintain her perspective. “The amount of money that these pets and their owners make is a little ridiculous,” she said. “Where I work, it’s a very interesting, interesting world.”  "
200,Woolly mammoth de-extinction is definitely not about making real-life Pokémon,['@etherington'],"April 4, 2023","Colossal Biosciences bills itself as the “de-extinction company” and is seeking to bring back the woolly mammoth, the thylacine (aka the Tasmanian tiger) and the dodo. Onstage at this year’s SXSW festival in Austin a couple weeks ago, co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm told me all about why the company wants to do that. You can watch the entire conversation above. We touch on a lot of different things during the conversation, including why Lamm switched from space and national defense to resuscitating long-dead mammals and birds. The serial entrepreneur also goes deep on how the work Colossal is doing now will actually help prevent other species from following in the footsteps of the animals it’s trying to bring back — and how it’s giving away the technologies it develops to help make that happen. Lamm also talks about how the company deals with the skepticism and criticism directed at Colossal and its mission, and why the startup definitely isn’t interested in producing animals to satisfy the unusual appetites of the bored rich — unlike maybe some other companies out there. And I also asked about a personal passion of mine, which, unfortunately, is not on Colossal’s product roadmap at the moment, according to Lamm.  "
201,Zoom acquires Ireland-based employee communications platform Workvivo,['@psawers'],"April 14, 2023","Zoom today announced plans to acquire Workvivo, a six-year-old Irish startup focused on improving companies’ internal communications and culture. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. While many enterprise communication tools — such as Zoom — specialize in real-time communication, Workvivo is very much about the asynchronous. The platform is less about project-specific collaboration than it is about fostering employee engagement at a broad level, including an activity feed, people directory, surveys and a conduit for critical company communications — a bit like a modern day intranet. Founded out of Cork in 2017, Workvivo has amassed a fairly impressive roster of customers too, including Amazon, RyanAir and Bupa. The company had raised nearly $40 million since its inception, including a $22 million Series B last year led by existing investor Tiger Global. Interestingly, it also received an angel investment from Zoom founder, chairman and CEO Eric Yuan back in 2019, making today’s announcement perhaps a little less surprising.   Image Credits: Workvivo Image Credits: Workvivo Workvivo was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the remote-work revolution spurred by the global pandemic, with the company reporting a 200% growth in ARR (annual recurring revenue) in 2020. And this, it seems, is a major reason why Zoom has elected to buy Workvivo. In its announcement today, Zoom noted that businesses “need to think differently” today in order to retain talent and build a strong company culture. “Today’s workforce is hybrid and distributed — with people working from home, in an office, at a remote location, on the frontlines of a retail floor or warehouse, as a pilot or flight attendant in an airplane, a nurse in a healthcare clinic, or anything in between,” it wrote. “Engaging employees and driving culture through connection is no longer a ‘nice to have’ — it’s imperative for success in today’s business environment.” While Workvivo had seemingly performed well during the pandemic boom times, so had Zoom. The video-communication giant hit a market cap of $160 billion in the middle of 2020, but in the intervening years — as with most other tech companies — its valuation returned to base, settling back at its pre-pandemic norm of around $20 billion. Thus, Zoom announced back in February that it was laying off around 15% of its workforce, impacting some 1,300 people, with Yuan pointing to its rapid growth during the pandemic and the global economic turmoil that followed as a key reason why it was having to cut back. In general though, Zoom is still performing fairly well, reporting a year-on-year revenue spike of 4% at its most recent earnings, though its growth overall has slowed significantly. But Zoom is clearly being careful not to rest on its laurels, and with Workvivo under its wing it will give Zoom a direct artery into a slew of big-name enterprise clients, while diversifying its product suite to support existing and new customers requiring both real-time and asynchronous communication tools. Zoom isn’t particularly well-known for its M&A activity, with only four previous known acquisitions to its name across its 12-year history. But when it does buy a company, there’s usually a clear strategic strand running through it — for example, last year it snapped up conversational AI startup Solvvy as it forged a path into the lucrative customer service space. Zoom said that it expects the Workvivo transaction to close in the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, which basically means by the end of next month. After this, it will set about integrating Workvivo’s features into Zoom itself, though there is no word on what this will mean in the long run for Workvivo as a standalone platform. Workvivo’s founders John Goulding and Joe Lennon, and the whole Workvivo team, will join Zoom once the deal closes. “Our focus is to integrate Workvivo into the Zoom platform, and we will look to streamline in the future,” a Zoom spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Workvivo employees will transition to Zoomies.”"
202,ispace loses contact with lunar lander seconds before touchdown,"['Aria Alamalhodaei', 'Devin Coldewey']","April 25, 2023","Japanese company ispace lost communication with its Hakuto-R lander just moments before it was supposed to touch down on the lunar surface. “At this moment, we have not been able to confirm successful landing on the lunar surface,” ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada said on the company’s livestream. “Currently, we have not confirmed the communication from the lander. […] We have to assume that we could not complete the landing on the lunar surface. ” He said that ispace engineers will continue to assess the situation and provide an update once that investigation is complete. In an interview with TechCrunch, Hakamada said that while it is possible that the lander is safe and intact on the surface, there is no data to support that yet and it’s unclear whether imagery from a lunar orbiter could shed light on the situation either. “The team said to me that they had communication until the very end of the landing. They are investigating very hard what really happened at the time of the touchdown,” Hakamada said. “Basically they are investigating our telemetry data; regarding image and video data, our camera on board was taking images, but our communication during landing was the low gain antenna, so we can’t expect the regular communications rates.” He added that regardless of the outcome, the mission has provided incredibly valuable data that will be used to inform the next lunar mission ispace undertakes — the kind of fast turnaround only possible at a private space company. The lander had a nominal five-month journey to the moon, after launching on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last December. The landing sequence appeared to be going well, with the lander moving at around 50 kilometers per hour, until the final landing sequence commenced. The news is no doubt a major disappointment for Tokyo-based ispace, which has been working on lunar landing technology since 2010. The company, which originated as a team competing for Google’s Lunar X Prize, was hoping to be the first fully private firm to send a commercial lander to the moon. Thus far, only three nations — the United States, the USSR, and China — have landed a spacecraft on the lunar surface. “We will keep going,” Hakamada said at the end of the livestream. “Never quit [our] lunar quest.”"

204,Arianna Simpson talks crypto at Disrupt and why a16z bets billions,[],"May 4, 2023","Investing in crypto is not for the faint of heart. The volatile crypto landscape is littered with the remains of high-profile collapses, like Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and FTX. Still, some VC firms — especially investment powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz (commonly known as a16z) — remain bullish on crypto. In May 2022, a16z announced a fourth crypto fund to the tune of $4.5 billion, which brings the total amount of funding it has raised for crypto and web3 alone to more than $7.6 billion. The company seems intent on staying in an industry from which many traditional VCs have stepped away. We want to know why. We also have questions about their web3 investing strategy, and more. This is why we’re thrilled that Arianna Simpson, general partner at a16z, will join us for a fireside chat at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 on September 19–21 in San Francisco. No matter how you invest it, that $4.5 billion fourth round is an outsized number. We’ll ask Simpson whether the opportunities are equally outsized and where she sees them taking shape. We’re also curious about how the company navigates not only the ecosystem’s infamous instability, but also the effects of recent high-profile bank closures on crypto and looming regulation. We’re interested to get Simpson’s take on the future of web3 — as the industry matures and reaches beyond tech and gaming enthusiasts to include a broader consumer audience. And that’s just for starters. Pretty sure we’ll come up with even more questions between now and September. Arianna Simpson, a general partner at a16z, invests in crypto. Prior to joining the VC firm, Simpson founded Autonomous Partners, an investment fund focused on cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

205,"Without a single euro changing hands, Irish nonprofit is helping to reinvent the grid",['@tdechant'],"April 27, 2023","Every day, strong gusts off the North Atlantic buffet hundreds of wind farms in Ireland, generating so much energy that owners often have no one to sell it to, forcing them to dump otherwise useful power. “12% to 14% of our potential generation goes into surplus. In Northern Ireland, it’s at 18%,” said Derek Roddy, co-founder and CEO of smart home company Climote. “If you’re a wind farmer, you are feeling the pain. This is a huge chunk of change that you’re walking away from, but the system struggles with what to do with it.” Roddy had been mulling this problem over for a while. Climote focuses on heating and hot water, so he thinks a lot about supply and demand signals in the electricity sector. It was on his mind when he attended an event where an Irish social enterprise called FoodCloud took home one of the top awards. FoodCloud, which was founded in 2012 by two university students, intercepts food that would otherwise go to waste and donates it to those in need. “I’m just listening in the audience to their whole story about sustainability, and I went, shit, surplus energy, surplus food — they’re the same,” Roddy told TechCrunch+. At that moment, he realized that he had been approaching the surplus energy problem the wrong way. With his company, he had been focused on the technology part of the puzzle. While that’s still a key piece, it hadn’t made the dent he wanted. After all, Ireland was still wasting a significant amount of wind power. “I went, OK, maybe we’re looking at this wrong, Maybe we need to go and do our bit for the world and the globe in solving the surplus piece and by default we prove how the actual system could work.” The answer wouldn’t be another startup, but a nonprofit social enterprise styled after FoodCloud. Having spent the last two decades in the smart home business, Roddy had a front-row seat to the Celtic Tiger economy. The tech sector had helped pull the previously agricultural nation out of poverty and turned it into one of the wealthiest nations in Europe. But even in wealthy countries, some people tend to be left behind."
206,Magnets and water net Magnotherm $6.9M seed round to kill hazardous refrigerants,['@tdechant'],"April 4, 2023","A warming world is going to need a lot of cold drinks. Problem is, today’s refrigeration tech is anything but climate friendly. The way we cool our food and drinks has barely changed in a century and the technology is still reliant on environmentally harmful refrigerants. Now, a German startup thinks it can freeze those refrigerants out of the market using little more than magnets and water while consuming up to 40% less energy. Magnotherm has been refining its technology, known as magnetocaloric refrigeration, since it was spun out of TU Darmstadt in 2019. Though it’s only a seed-stage company, the startup has already shipped five display coolers to beverage giant Coca-Cola, TechCrunch+ has learned, and it’s on track to build another 55 that will be rented out for events. But beverage coolers are just the tech demo: “We are really building a bigger box for supermarket cooling cabinets,” co-CEO Timur Sirman said. “This is where we can actually reduce energy costs and maintenance costs significantly.” The global market for commercial refrigeration is worth $37 billion, according to Grand View Research. To capitalize on the opportunity, Magnotherm is announcing a seed round today. In an exclusive with TechCrunch+, Sirman said the company was shooting for €5 million, “and now, we’re actually oversubscribed.” Investor interest was so great that they’re closing the round with €6.3 million. Extantia Capital led the round, with Hessen Kapital, Lauda Dr. R. WOBSER Beteiligungs-GmbH and Revent joining. Four investors from the Better Ventures Angel Club also participated. The technology Magnotherm hopes to dethrone is broadly used and deeply entrenched. It’s not as efficient as it could be, but more troubling are the substances it uses to keep things cool. The refrigerator sitting in your kitchen gets its chill from the physical properties of its refrigerants, the gases that loop through the cooling system. None of these refrigerants come without tradeoffs. First generation refrigerants — freon and its ilk — chewed a hole in the ozone layer. Newer ones are more ozone-friendly, but they are powerful greenhouse gases, warming the Earth hundreds to thousands of times more than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. Countries are working to phase out their use, but finding replacements hasn’t been easy. One frontrunner, propane, is flammable, and regulators have hesitated to greenlight its use in larger refrigerators in case of leaks. Carbon dioxide is another contender, but it only works as a refrigerant under very high pressures, which makes the whole system more expensive."
207,Apple launches Apple Card’s savings accounts with 4.15% interest rate,['@romaindillet'],"April 18, 2023","Apple Card customers in the U.S. can open a savings account and earn interest through an Apple saving account. To learn the specifics about Apple’s new offering, click here. When the company originally announced the new financial product back in October, Apple said that it couldn’t share what interest rate would be paid out on these accounts because rates are fluctuating so much these days. As of today, Apple is going to offer an APY of 4.15%. It looks like a competitive offering when you look at data from Bankrate — you can currently find savings accounts that offer an APY of 3.5% to 4.75%. The company isn’t making any promise when it comes to future interest rates. It could go up and down at any time. Apple has partnered with Goldman Sachs once again for the banking feature. Savings accounts are technically managed by Goldman Sachs, which means that balances are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This high-yield savings account has been created specifically for Apple Card customers. When customers pay with their Apple Card, they get cash back on all purchases. By default, all purchases grant you 1% in cash rewards and 2% for all purchases made using Apple Pay. Purchases with select merchants unlock 3% in rewards. By default, customers receive cash rewards every day into Apple Cash, a pocket of money that appears in the Wallet app and that works more or less like a checking account. Your Apple Cash balance can be used to pay for things using Apple Pay, for your credit card balance or to send money to friends and family members. You also can transfer this balance to a regular bank account. Starting today, Apple Card users can choose to deposit their daily rewards into their savings accounts. It’s a way to save money without having to think too much about it. Your savings account is accessible from the Wallet app as well. You can see your current balance, the current interest rate and your most recent transactions. From this screen, users can also manually add or withdraw money. The balance can be transferred to Apple Cash or a regular bank account. “Savings helps our users get even more value out of their favorite Apple Card benefit — Daily Cash — while providing them with an easy way to save money every day,” Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, said in a statement. “Our goal is to build tools that help users lead healthier financial lives, and building Savings into Apple Card in Wallet enables them to spend, send, and save Daily Cash directly and seamlessly — all from one place.” There are no fees associated with Apple’s savings account. However, there is a maximum balance limit of $250,000. The APY of 4.15% applies to any sized balance and there is no minimum balance required. Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple You must first meet the following credentials in order to open an account: You can either transfer funds from your Apple Cash balance into your new savings account, or transfer funds from another bank account. Yes, balances are covered by FDIC. Apple’s Savings Deposit Account Agreement reads: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, and per ownership category. In determining how much insurance is applicable to your Account, you need to consider all accounts that you hold with us. For more information, visit the FDIC’s website or call the FDIC directly at 1-877-ASKFDIC (1-877-275-3342). You can also refer to the FDIC’s Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE).

On Thursday, he announced that creators can apply for monetization and offer subscriptions to users. For the next 12 months, Twitter will give all money to creators after paying Apple or Google their 30% cut. Post that, the Apple/Google tax will reduce to 15% and the social media company will take a smaller fee from creators. However, Google’s terms indicate that it charges only 15% of fees on subscriptions. So it’s not clear why Musk said the search giant’s charge was 30%. For the next 12 months, Twitter will keep none of the money.

Twitter’s rules indicate that creators need to be at least 18 years old, they need to have 10,000 active followers, and they need to have tweeted at least 25 times in the last 30 days to be eligible for monetization. At the moment, Twitter’s monetization program is only available for users in the U.S. But Musk said the company is working to expand the program to other countries. This monetization relaunch is essentially a rebranding of the company’s Super Follows program, which was first introduced in 2021. Musk has just added a few features like text formatting and longer videos to make it look like a new tool. Long-form writing is also not entirely new. Last June, the company introduced a program called Twitter Notes for select writers. However, that program was shut down under Musk. After taking over the company he also killed newsletter tool Revue, a startup Twitter had acquired in 2021. Twitter is also in a fierce battle with newsletter platform Substack, which introduced a Twitter-like feed called Notes earlier this week. In the past few days, the social network started blocking links to Substack and even disallowed replies, retweets, or bookmarks on tweets with links to the newsletter service. When Matt Taibbi, who wrote on Twitter Files multiple times, said that he was going to move to Substack Notes, Musk charged him of being an employee of Substack (Spoiler: he’s not). Musk also accused Substack of “trying to download a massive portion of the Twitter database to bootstrap their Twitter clone.” This claim was dismissed by Substack CEO Chris Best. 1. Substack links were never blocked. Matt’s statement is false. 2. Substack was trying to download a massive portion of the Twitter database to bootstrap their Twitter clone, so their IP address is obviously untrusted. 3. Turns out Matt is/was an employee of Substack. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 8, 2023  In February, the Tesla CEO had promised ad revenue sharing with Blue subscribers, but the feature hasn’t appeared anywhere yet."
210,"Finix becomes a payments processor, heating up its competition with Stripe",['@bayareawriter'],"May 2, 2023","Payments infrastructure startup Finix has slowly been taking swipes at Stripe, first becoming a facilitator, and now becoming a processor. Finix said today it now is directly connected to all major U.S. card networks — American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa. Now that Finix no longer relies on a third-party processor, it says it’s able to offer businesses “instant onboarding, improved economics and opportunities for lowering interchange fees.” Says co-founder and CEO Richie Serna: “This has been one of the holy grails that we’ve always been aspiring to — how can you get as close to the bare metal as possible?” “One of the interesting things is that I think there’s something like less than 25 payment processors here in the U.S. —  four of them actually have about 80% of the entire market share and most of those tech stacks were built in the early 90s,” he added. “And so, to really unlock some of the incredible innovations that these networks have released over the last few years, such as tap to pay, QR code payments, network tokens — you have to go directly to the source and that’s something that takes years of development.” The SaaS startup — which started its business by selling its flexible payments software to other businesses — doesn’t lean away from comparisons. VC history is partly to blame here: Finix raised a $35 million Series B led by Sequoia. In an unusual twist, Sequoia just one month later walked away from the deal in which it reportedly wrote the self-described payments infrastructure company a $21 million check. As TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos reported at the time, Finix told employees that soon after issuing its check, Sequoia concluded that Finix competes too directly with Stripe, the payments company that represented one of Sequoia’s biggest private holdings and that in turn counted Sequoia as one of its biggest outside investors. Fast-forward to last May. Finix announced that it was becoming a payments facilitator, which it had not historically been able to do as just an API provider. That move too put it in direct competition with Stripe. For the unacquainted, a processor is a company that connects directly into the major card networks for the purpose of transmitting payment transaction data and funds on behalf of a merchant. A payment facilitator on the other hand has to work with a payments processor to move money.  Today, Finix says it processes “tens of billions of dollars for tens of thousands of merchants.” The “big four” payment processors that Serna referred to include Fiserv (First Data), JPMorgan Chase, FIS (Worldpay) and GPN/TSYS. Block (formally known as Square) is often viewed as a payment processor, is actually built on top of other payments technology and itself works with a number of payment processors to provide direct connection into networks, Serna noted. Serna believes that Finix’s tech stands out because it was built from the ground up, and not built through a number of acquisitions as in the case of some legacy providers.  “It’s impossible to combine a lot of these tech stacks, because not all of those tools play well together,” he said. He also points out that Finix’s integrations are not restricted to the U.S. like some of the other processors.  “If you’re looking at doing merchant acceptance worldwide, typically you’d have to go and find multiple processors,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. “By having those direct to network integrations like we now have, we can partner with banks all around the world to give our customers one access for multiple countries and multiple currencies, and other alternative payment methods as well.” While it may not be a “big four processor,” Finix still views fintech giant Stripe as competition. Serna believes that Finix’s latest move only drives the two closer toward each other despite the disparity in size (Finix has 130 or so employees and Stripe had just under 7,000 as of last November) and funding (Finix has raised about $133 million in funding and Stripe has raised nearly $9 billion). “I think we’ve always thought about building a company in our tech stack differently. When you think about Stripe they’ve built really for speed, whereas we’ve built on Java, for scalability and for security,” he said. “And from day one, they started off with startups who were really just e-commerce merchants whereas we built for SaaS platforms and marketplaces that had more configurable and scalability challenges that we wanted to be able to support.” Serna added: “I think that kind of shows in what we’ve heard from a number of our customers, is that while Stripe started off very simple, they’ve actually oversimplified and abstracted away too much from what our customers really need.” Want more fintech news in your inbox?

211,Goodbye to the fat middle,['@etherington'],"April 18, 2023","Adobe debuted its Firefly generative AI initiative last month, showcasing first a model trained on its own Adobe Stock images, and then yesterday it unveiled what it’s working on initially around video and audio editing. The features sound like powerful, efficiency-enhancing additions to a creative workflow — but they also sound poised to replace a significant chunk of the work currently done by real humans, even if that work isn’t exactly earning massive accolades or peer recognition. Here’s what Adobe tipped in its announcement: What is perhaps most startling about updates like this from companies that essentially own the entire professional creative workflow is the casual way it describes upcoming automated features that currently account for thousands of hours of paid labor by gainfully employed individuals. To be clear, I’m not decrying the progress of technology here: To the contrary, I’m mostly watching the rapid pace of innovation around generative AI with awe and wonder. But you can both celebrate something and worry about its negative knock-on effects, and in fact, everyone involved should simultaneously hold both of those things in their heads. As the headline suggests, what’s most in danger of future extinction within these bullet points provided by Adobe is effectively the fat middle of the bell curve of multimedia editing work. Color grading work to achieve a desired look is certainly going to make “the time between imagination and final product all but disappear,” but that time isn’t an inconvenience for probably upwards of tens of thousands of creative pros — it’s the meat of their work and billable hours. Likewise for composing and recording generic music for use in low-budget projects; crafting typefaces and titles for everything that isn’t a Hollywood blockbuster; and storyboarding and curating/maintaining b-roll footage libraries. The same counterarguments apply here that are typically levied in discussions of innovation versus displaced current-day jobs: These will all just free up time previously dedicated to busywork to allow pros to focus on “real” creative work. Plus, they’ll only ever account for the sub-par and mediocre work in the fields where they apply, leaving the truly excellent stuff to the human pros. These are fine arguments, and true to an extent, but it ignores some fundamental realities. The first is that people are not made to be doing “high-value” work all of the time — doing busywork contributes to a natural rhythm of productivity that ebbs and flows, but that does so in a healthy way. The second is that most people make their living being mediocre, by definition. Even if all that the AI can ever achieve is “workmanlike” results, that’s the vast majority of the work done in creative industries. Most editors and colorists are not producing Blade Runner 2049; they’re making shampoo commercials or HR training videos. I feel the need to reiterate that I’m not arguing for a cessation of development of these kinds of features, and in fact I’m excited to see their progress and try them out for myself. I am, however, advocating for more discussion and consideration of what the advent of these kinds of technologies mean for workforce transformation. Major revolutions in how people work do happen, and obviously society moves forward each time. But it’s a mistake to think these things occur passively and in a fixed manner. Ensuring they occur with the least amount of negative impact on the people involved requires careful forethought, intention and planning — all of which should be baked into the process right alongside the innovation and iteration by the same people doing that work, too."
212,EU warns Twitter over disinformation after Musk policy shifts found to boost Kremlin propaganda,['@riptari'],"April 26, 2023","Twitter was only confirmed yesterday as one of 19 major tech platforms subject to centralized oversight by the European Union’s executive starting this fall, when so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) are expected to be compliant with the Digital Services Act (DSA). But the Commission has not wasted any time warning the Elon Musk-owned social network that things aren’t looking good for staying on the right side of the incoming law. The DSA requires major platforms to take steps to mitigate systemic risks like disinformation, while breaches of the regime can attract penalties of up to 6% of global annual turnover. On Twitter’s 2022 revenue, such a fine could sum to over a couple of hundred million dollars — with the caveat that the platform’s revenue may not hold up this year, given Musk’s erratic antics scaring away advertisers and alienating plenty of users. In a pair of tweets sent out today, Vera Jourova, the EU’s values and transparency VP, warned of “yet another negative sign” by Twitter — accusing the platform under Musk of “not making digital information space any safer and free from the Kremlin #disinformation & malicious influence”. Her tweets cite an AP report on research by Reset, a London-based non-profit that tracks the spread of propaganda by authoritarian regimes, which found that recent policy changes at Twitter have significantly amplified state-backed disinformation on the platform — namely Musk’s decision to remove state-backed labels from accounts operated by authoritarian governments in Russia, China and Iran and also to lift restrictions on algorithmic amplification of their content. Per Reset’s research, Kremlin propaganda saw a visibility boost of around a third. AP’s report also cites earlier research by the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which found that Musk’s decision to remove the state-affiliated labels appears to have reversed a decline in followers for many of the accounts. “To me this is a signal that #Twitter is falling short of its commitments to the anti-disinformation Code,” Jourova went on. “This is a paramount test to show they are serious about respecting the Code and ultimately compliance with the #DigitalServicesAct.” To me this is a signal that #Twitter is falling short of its commitments to the anti-disinformation Code. This is a paramount test to show they are serious about respecting the Code and ultimately compliance with the #DigitalServicesAct. (2/2) — Věra Jourová (@VeraJourova) April 26, 2023  The bloc backed restrictions on two Russian state-affiliated news channels (RT and Sputnik) in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. The step included not only prohibitions on traditional broadcast media from screening the channels but a legal requirement that online platforms avoid distributing their content too. At the time of writing Twitter users trying to access the two prohibited channels from inside the European Economic Area or the U.K. (which also imposed limits) are met with a notification that the account is “withheld” across 28 countries. However users can circumvent the ban by, for example, using a VPN and changing their location to a country where the accounts are not withheld. And if they do that they will find that, as a result of Musk’s changes rowing back on prior anti-disinformation policies, these accounts are longer labeled as state-affiliated nor are they algorithmically de-amplified. Jourova’s comment vis-a-vis “respecting the Code” is a reference to the EU’s Code of Practice on Online Disinformation — which Twitter voluntarily signed up to back in September 2018, when Musk was just a high profile Twitter user, not its erratic billionaire owner. As we reported at the time, the initial EU Code was a weak bite at tackling what was then still sometimes being referred to as ‘fake news’. But the EU went on to present a beefed up version of the Code last summer. And while the mechanism remains voluntary (i.e. self regulation, rather than legally binding rules), the bloc’s lawmakers have signalled that the Code’s commitments will count towards future compliance with the DSA. Ergo, on the flip side, not meeting the commitments to combat disinformation should count as a black mark against DSA compliance for any signed up VLOPs — which are, under the DSA, required to proactively assess systemic risks like disinformation and put in place effective mitigation measures while also taking steps to avoid harming freedom of expression. The Commission will be technically empowered to enforce against DSA breaches by VLOPs from late August/September — when a four-month implementation period expires for the first wave of larger platforms. So Twitter still has a few months to get its house in order. (Or, more realistically, pick up the smithereens left by Musk’s wrecking ball and try to put a coherent content moderation policy approach back together.) Although there’s actually a longer lead in for the Code commitments to bite as the mechanism can’t be officially linked to the Commission’s enforcement framework for the DSA until after a European Board for Digital Services has been set up — which is not expected until the deadline for the general entry into application of all DSA provisions (in February next year). This means Musk probably has until early 2024 (at least) to play regional disinformation chaos agent — before any hard DSA-based reckoning lands over his love of ‘democratizing’ authoritarian propaganda. That said, it’s interesting to see the EU getting in so early with public warnings to Musk on disinformation. Which may be a sign the Commission feels its facing some risk here too. Not least the risk that Twitter’s presence as a continued signatory to its anti-disinformation Code while its owner is actively ripping up anti-disinformation policies — and has himself been accused of spreading Kremlin propaganda — is, to put it diplomatically, pretty damn awkward. The Code being self-regulation also ties the EU’s hands in the sense that they can’t prescribe who joins it nor boot existing signatories out for making a mockery of provisions like Commitment 18 — to “minimize the risks of viral propagation of misinformation or disinformation by adopting safe design practices as they develop their systems, policies, and features” — something Twitter was still technically signed up to at the last check. Yet, again, it looks hard to square an on-paper claim by Twitter that it’s committed to shrinking the risks of viral disinformation with policy decisions by Musk U-turn on promoting state-affiliated propaganda channels; tearing up rules on COVID-19 misinformation; or simply blowing up the legacy verification system and replacing it with what looks like an intentionally confusing mess whereby scammers and spammers are encouraged to pay $8 to get their content automatically amplified over non-paying users. Given the lag between the EU’s disinformation Code getting hard linked to the DSA as a key mitigation measure — as expected — and the delicate dance ahead of the Commission to enforce rules in an area as tricky and slippery as (subjective and often politically charged) disinformation the bloc appears to have decided it can at least make some noise decrying Musk’s blatantly bad faith approach in public in the meanwhile.

213,"Metaverse is just VR, admits Meta, as it lobbies against ‘arbitrary’ network fee",['@riptari'],"March 23, 2023","Meta, the self-styled “metaverse company” formerly known as Facebook, has taken on a novel role de-hyping the virtual world technology its founder bet the farm on just a few short years ago. No, it hasn’t announced another pivot — rather it’s been forced to dial down the multicolored metaverse hype as it lobbies against a proposal pushed by European mobile network operators who want regional lawmakers to force major content providers (i.e. tech giants like Meta) to pay them a fee for carrying their data — a double-dip scenario they’ve suggested is required to fund network infrastructure upgrades they claim are needed to make the metaverse happen… The telcos’ complaints about their (relative) poverty (vs tech giants) is obviously controversial but does appear to have bent ears in Brussels: In February, EU lawmakers announced an exploratory consultation on the future of network funding. And, shortly after that, the bloc’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, took a turn on stage at an annual telco industry bash — sounding pretty sympathetic to their cause. (Although in remarks to press straight after this he maintained that nothing has been decided yet.) In a blog post dubbing the telcos’ framing a “false premise”, Meta’s Kevin Salvadori, VP of network and Bruno Cendon Martin, director & head of wireless technologies, don’t mince their words — calling the telcos’ argument “nonsense” and the proposed network fee “arbitrary”. Telcos lobbying for the proposal have suggested five or six of the biggest content providers should pay — putting Meta in the frame, along with other Internet giants like Netflix and Alphabet.   “We know that some European telecom operators have justified network fee proposals by speculating about capacity constraints caused by metaverse adoption — but this is nonsense,” Salvadori and Martin write. “The development of the metaverse will not require telecom operators to grow capital expenditures for greater network investment.” They go on to explain this is because “metaverse adoption for the foreseeable future will continue to be driven predominantly through Virtual Reality (VR)” — and that “almost all VR content is currently consumed over fixed networks through Wi-Fi” — an infrastructure they argue is already well established across most of Europe. “Looking ahead, Europe’s fixed network capacity, with easily upgradeable FTTH/B [fiber-to-the-home/building] deployments, is more than enough to supply demand for the metaverse and other internet services for decades to come,” they add, suggesting there won’t be a significant difference in product experience between being tethered to a headset in VR (something that’s been around for ooooh donkeys years) and being ‘in the metaverse’ for, er, many more donkeys’ years. Oh. What about AR (augmented reality)? The blog post attempts a bit of a ‘reverse ferret’ on this, to reclaim a sprinkling of metaverse hype, with the Metamates writing: “The immersive worlds we can discover in VR are just one possible way to experience the metaverse. Augmented Reality (AR) devices, which overlay digital content onto the real world in a small form factor, will be another important part of the metaverse in the future.” However they just as quickly pour more cold water on the notion of there being any meaningful mobile (AR) metaverse action on the horizon. So — tl;dr — you can shelve the idea of free-floating in any (queasily colored) Meta mobile metaverse/s that blend immersive virtual worlds with the physicality of being out and about for real. (Although, to be fair, that sounds like it would be an unpleasant and confusing nightmare — and moreover, notably, the blog post goes on to suggest even the AR metaverse is going to be fairly static, likely tethered to home/other wi-fi most of the time too. But, well, we’re sure the porn industry will invent some novel use-cases for that for the true ‘blended reality’ believers.) “As we set out in December, our vision for the creation of true AR glasses will require years of progress to make our devices slimmer, lighter, faster, and more powerful, all while consuming less battery power and generating less heat. Devices will need to understand both the world and user expressions to effectively overlay pixels on top of reality to offer a truly transformative experience,” they warn. “Our engineers are some of the best in the world, and they continue to be at the vanguard of bringing our AR vision to life. It is one of the most ambitious R&D efforts in the world today, focused on building a truly revolutionary new kind of computing platform. However, to overcome the challenges set out above, it will take years before AR devices become ubiquitous.” That’s “years”, twice — straight from the Metamates’ mouth. So metaverse lovers, better not wait around for this one. Get yourself over to Horizon Worlds right now — for a true taste of those metaverse decades to come.  "
214,Survey says!,['@bheater'],"April 13, 2023","Last fall, Alex and I discussed bringing back the TC+ robotics survey. I gave him the usual caveat: I’m into it, but it will have to wait until I can find the time. You know how these things go — you wake up one morning and somehow it’s five months later. I’ve got excuses if you need them. I got burned out and took a few weeks off in December. And then it was CES and MWC, and suddenly I’m back at 2019 travel levels, wondering if my rabbit will remember my name when I walk through that door. So if the survey wasn’t overdue before, it unquestionably is now. The last time we ran one of these was back in February 2020 — ominous timing, to put it mildly. The world had entered the earliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and following the first waves in Asia and Europe, the U.S. was right on the cusp of getting hit hard. It was, in hindsight, the beginning of a seismic shift for many industries — and robotics was primed to help. In fact, one can make a compelling argument that those three intervening years were the most broadly transformative for the category. It was a perfect storm. Growth on the warehouse/logistics side had its own sea-change moment eight years prior, with Amazon’s Kiva acquisition. Retailers that were behind the curve had two choices once the pandemic rolled around: automate or die. It’s a stark framing, I recognize, but remember that anyone not classified an “essential worker” was suddenly grounded. Overnight, companies were attempting to compete with Amazon’s promise of same- and next-day shipping with far fewer people. It’s frankly a wonder that so many came out the other side intact. Other industries were desperate to follow fulfillment’s lead. Suddenly, it seemed, a lot more money was flooding in to robotic solutions to categories like construction, agriculture, food service and healthcare, to name a few. Thankfully, robotics had seen profound advances in the previous decade, owing to advances in other fields like consumer electronics (sensors) and self-driving cars (sensors). In fact, I don’t think I would get much pushback for saying that robotics has thus far benefited more from autonomous driving advances than the cars themselves. I’m not saying that will always be the case, but there are myriad reasons why it’s far easier to operate a warehouse robot autonomously than it is to automate a 4,000-pound car cruising down a highway at 65 mph. Following this all in real-time, I will say, anecdotally, that the excitement surrounding robotics shielded it from the effect of early macro trends. There was a little while in which investments in the space kept chugging along, but I don’t think any of us expected that to last forever. Ultimately the bad economy slowed things down, and a couple of bank collapses certainly didn’t help matters much. I continue to be extremely bullish, however. And I’m certainly not alone in that. External forces were bound to hamper investments for a bit, but it never felt like a regression. In fact, it didn’t feel like the pandemic expanded the industry as much as it accelerated it by a few years. Everything that’s happening right now has felt inevitable for a while, but it’s always been a question of when. As you can no doubt imagine, I have a lot of questions after three years. The good news is I was able to whittle them down to a mere nine. I sent out a survey to top investors covering topics ranging from the state of investing, to RaaS, to what automation can do to address climate change. In the end, we had 13 investors send back responses. The answers were thoughtful and candid and — taken as a whole — provide what may well be the best snapshot of this moment in robot VC.

As you can imagine, we got a lot of answers. The good news is that this will really help me write Actuator for the next few weeks. I will be highlighting a few questions — and corresponding answers — here, starting today. TC: What is the next big robotics success story after warehouse/fulfillment? Milo Werner, The Engine: Basically everything around you will become a robot. The most simple example is autonomous vehicles. These are very advanced robots and have been open to riders since 2018. The labor shortages are going to drive significant growth in the service sectors, including cleaning, food and care services. While there are already automated single-purpose solutions in these areas, more general-purpose robots are going to start to take front stage in the next decade. Neel Mehta, G2 Venture Partners: I’d say it’s either going to be food or manufacturing. Food: We are seeing restaurants, co-packers, and frozen meal manufacturers increasingly gravitate toward robots. I’m specifically talking about high-mix production, whereby food production is more complex with lots of ingredients and SKUs (automation is already common in low-mix production). We’ve heard that the food industry is 40% understaffed and operating at less than 50% capacity. Working conditions are also poor and worker performance is inconsistent (resulting in waste). It’s still early days for this space, but there are a handful of interesting companies deploying robots at frozen food manufacturers and restaurants (e.g., Miso Robotics, Chef Robotics, Hyphen) Manufacturing: On-shoring of manufacturing due to IRA-related tailwinds is going to have a massive impact on deployment of robotics in the next five to 10 years. There is a growing skills mismatch that will result in millions of unfulfilled manufacturing jobs in the latter part of the decade. Welding is particularly interesting because of the aging population of human welders. What categories are the most underserved by robotics startups? What would you like to see more of? Abe Murray, Alley Robotics: All of them! We believe there should be 10x more robotics startups than there are today. There are gaps and opportunities everywhere. Even in logistics, the most saturated space in robotics, fewer than 10% of warehouses are automated. Oliver Keown, Intuitive Ventures: Automation and miniaturization in healthcare. Integration of the robot and biological manipulation. To take minimally invasive care to the next level, there needs to be technology that enables treatment to the right patient at the right time at the site of disease — from immunotherapy to gene and cell therapy, to novel energy modalities.

Since I’m a longtime New York resident who writes about robots for a living, Mayor Eric Adams’ recent press conference was right in my wheelhouse. The city is now piloting two surveillance robots in high-traffic areas: Boston Dynamics’ Spot (referred to as “Digidog” here) and Knightscope’s K5. “I’ve stated this from day one, even when I was on the campaign trail: I’m a computer geek. I believe that technology is here,” Adams noted in his remarks. “We can’t be afraid of it, and as [NYPD commissioner Keechant Sewell] stated, transparency is the key.” Asked about the de Blasio administration’s decision to pull Spot pilots over public backlash, Adams stated, “Digidog is now out of the pound.” Image Credits: Carbon Robotics Image Credits: Carbon Robotics This week, Carbon Robotics announced a $30 million raise to help scale its laser weeding robot, LaserWeeder. The Seattle-based firm says that it has zapped “500 million weeds across 40 different crops” thus far. No specific unit figures, but Carbon is set to deliver LaserWeeder to 17 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces in 2023. “This financing round further supports our mission to provide cost-effective and efficient precision agtech tools to growers,” founder and CEO Paul Mikesell said of the Series C. “Traditional weeding methods, including hand weeding and herbicides, are expensive, unreliable and damage soil health. The LaserWeeder uniquely addresses all of these challenges.” Image Credits: Amazon Image Credits: Amazon Also this week, Amazon announced the publication of a pick and place dataset featuring more than 190,000 objects. The company notes: The scenario in which the ARMBench images were collected involves a robotic arm that must retrieve a single item from a bin full of items and transfer it to a tray on a conveyor belt.

215,Verto claims a quarter of SVB customers operating in Africa are opening accounts on its platform,['@ulonnaya'],"April 5, 2023","Verto, a London-based B2B cross-border foreign exchange (FX) and payments enabler for startups and small businesses, said it has acquired a quarter of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) customers from Africa and the MENA region. According to the startup’s own data, SVB had nearly 250 clients operating in both regions before its collapse — the American bank provided startups with venture debt, credit cards, and term loans. Thus, it is onboarding over 60 companies and venture firms (some with headquarters in the U.S. and Europe), including Jumia, Chipper Cash and TapTap Send. After the bank’s collapse, African startups have been forced to review their banking options to cushion them from future eventualities. Founders and investors who spoke to TechCrunch last month said they would hold funds in multiple bank accounts across big financial institutions, which are generally perceived to be safer. They said they would also leverage smaller fintechs such as Brex and Mercury that have more extensive FDIC protection (both platforms recently increased their provision to protect deposited funds up to $2.25 million and $3 million, respectively). Though local and homegrown options for African startups and investors were few and far between, it’s unlikely to remain the case in coming months as fintechs such as Verto are getting in on the action, attempting to position themselves as alternatives.   Verto’s primarily provides a cross-border platform that helps startups, SMEs and large corporates send, receive and exchange money in more than 190 countries. Clients can hold funds in their Verto accounts in up to 51 currencies. The company, which has over 3,000 clients, including MTN, Yoco and Interswitch, says its transaction volume grew 70% last year to over $3 billion. It expects to triple this volume within the next 12 months after carrying out some expansion plans as well as product launches. Among other things, the startup launched “safeguarded” USD accounts last month following SVB’s fallout. “Depositing money with U.S. banks is the most popular option for African startups but most of them rarely meet the conditions of doing so. Meanwhile, companies like us have simple banking solutions built and catered for startups based in Africa and other emerging markets. While we had been building this product, we recently launched in beta in light of these events where we’ve got an influx of demand from some startups and VCs,” co-founder and CTO Anthony Oduu told TechCrunch over a call, adding that customers can access up to 25 safeguarded accounts (holding different currencies) on Verto. Safeguarded accounts are commonly used by U.K. financial institutions and bodies to protect U.K.-based customers by ring-fencing their funds from financial shocks. It doesn’t work like FDIC insurance or U.K. deposit schemes where deposits are capped at £85,000 and $250,000, respectively. Safeguarded accounts cover the total amount of relevant funds irrespective of how much a client holds in the bank. For instance, if a customer has £500,000 in such an account, they receive that amount should the bank dissolve. Verto, as an E-Money institution, says it has extended these accounts to other international currencies regardless of the customer’s country of incorporation. The fintech company says it holds “designated safeguarding accounts” with accredited banks in the U.K.; neither the startup nor the banks can claim the funds in these accounts, Verto says. Should it go insolvent for any reason, customers’ funds remain protected. Meanwhile, funds protected under safeguarding obligations do not attract interest payments, unlike funds in typical insured accounts. “From the moment we receive your funds for the execution of a payment service or for loading your wallets, we treat those funds immediately as funds to be safeguarded and will ensure they are not commingled with other funds,” the company said in response to questions on why founders and investors should use safeguarded accounts. “These funds are marked as ‘relevant funds’ to be safeguarded at all times and we move all relevant funds to the designated safeguarding accounts. We keep records of our client’s balances held with us and reconcile these daily so that we are never short on funds being safeguarded.” Verto says it’s received more than $30 million in monthly deposit requests per company; however, Oduu notes that this money won’t sit idle in their accounts as most of its newfound clients plan to use Verto for operational purposes, such as payroll and payouts. The fintech, founded in 2018 by Oduu and Ola Oyetayo and backed by Y Combinator, has raised over $12 million from investors, including emerging markets-focused VC firm Quona Capital, Treasury (founded by Betterment’s Eli Broverman and Acorns’ Jeff Cruttenden) and Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP).

216,"This Week in Apps: WWDC23, ByteDance pushes Lemon8 ahead of TikTok ban, T2 capitalizes on Twitter chaos",['@sarahintampa'],"April 1, 2023","Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app economy in 2023 hit a few snags, as consumer spending last year dropped for the first time by 2% to $167 billion, according to data.ai’s “State of Mobile” report. However, downloads are continuing to grow, up 11% year-over-year in 2022 to reach 255 billion. Consumers are also spending more time in mobile apps than ever before. On Android devices alone, hours spent in 2022 grew 9%, reaching 4.1 trillion. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.

Sign up here: techcrunch.com/newsletters Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple As expected, Apple announced its plans for this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The big event will return to Apple Park in Cupertino on June 5-9. However, the event looks like it will still be another scaled-down version, similar to last year, with its keynote and State of the Union again livestreamed. Apple also noted it will host a special all-day event for developers and students on June 5. And, as in previous years, developers will be able to meet some of the teams at Apple, celebrate top apps at the Apple Design Awards ceremony and enjoy various evening activities. Student developers will also participate in a Swift Student Challenge competition, which could win them WWDC23 outerwear, AirPods Pro, a customized pin set and a one-year membership to the Apple Developer Program. The deadline to apply is April 19. The company will continue to post WWDC announcements leading up to and during the conference, so keep an eye on your inboxes and the Apple Developer app for updates. The big question on everyone’s minds is whether or not Apple will present its AR/VR headset during WWDC this year. Various reports have suggested mass production on the device has been pushed back a couple of months to the third quarter of 2023. Plus, a concerning report by The New York Times indicated the device is among the first to generate rare, internal dissent among Apple employees — some of whom don’t believe it’s a fit for the company. Expected to be priced at $3,000, some are worried about its utility and the still unproven market. Still, Bloomberg is betting on a headset reveal and the accompanying xrOS software. The company will also likely introduce the latest updates to its existing OS lineup, including iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, macOS 14 and tvOS 17. Not much is known about these coming releases except that iOS 17 is codenamed Dawn and will include several of users’ “most-requested” features. When Apple set out to develop iOS 17, the initial thinking was to call it a tuneup release — one focused more on fixing bugs and improving performance than adding new features (not unlike the approach the company took with Snow Leopard on Mac OS X back in 2009). The hope was to… — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) March 26, 2023  Image Credits: Lemon8 Image Credits: Lemon8 As U.S. lawmakers moved forward with their plans for a TikTok ban or forced sale, the app’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, began driving another of its social platforms into the Top Charts of the U.S. App Store. The ByteDance-owned app Lemon8, an Instagram rival that describes itself as a “lifestyle community,” jumped into the U.S. App Store’s Top Charts on Monday, becoming the No. 10 Overall app, across both apps and games. By the next day, it ranked No. 9 on the App Store’s Top Apps chart, excluding games. This is a dramatic chart climb for the little-known app and one that points to paid user acquisition efforts powering this surge. Prior to Monday, the Lemon8 app had never before ranked in the Top 200 Overall Charts in the U.S., according to app store intelligence provided to TechCrunch by data.ai. The firm confirmed that such a quick move from being an unranked app to being No. 9 among the top free apps in the U.S. — ahead of YouTube, WhatsApp, Gmail and Facebook — implies a “significant” and “recent” user acquisition push on the app publisher’s part. The app was launched globally back in March 2020 but was only more recently launched on the U.S. App Store, seemingly for testing purposes. Over the past few days this week, it was more “officially” launched — that is, it was accompanied by the clearly sizable spend on paid discovery or app install ads. Globally, Lemon8 had 16 million total installs, Apptopia’s data indicates, with Japan as its largest market. To push the app up the charts, ByteDance simply leveraged its own channels with influencer reviews on TikTok. Across a number of undisclosed ads, many creators began posting about Lemon8, with their new videos appearing in just the 24 hours prior to the app’s skyrocketing. Most of the reviews used similar language, describing the app as “cute” and a mix of “Pinterest and Instagram.” The creators didn’t tell their followers they were being paid to boost Lemon8. Despite these efforts, Lemon8 may not be a viable backup plan for a TikTok ban, as lawmakers could consider a wide-ranging set of restrictions on Chinese tech, including on mobile applications far beyond TikTok alone.   As Twitter begins its shift to a “pay to play” business model, a new Twitter alternative is preparing to take flight. T2, the seed-funded Twitter rival developed by Google and Twitter veterans, is ready to capitalize on Twitter’s upheaval with the launch of a verification program specifically targeting those who are poised to lose their checkmark under Elon Musk’s new Twitter policies. T2 also this week announced a notable new hire with the addition of Discord’s former Senior Director of Engineering Michael Greer as its new chief technology officer (CTO). Greer joined Discord in 2017, initially as director of Engineering, which touched on a number of areas, including revenue, growth, apps, community servers, design systems, messaging and more. He was promoted to senior director of Engineering just last June. Prior to Discord, Greer worked as the CTO at Tapp Media and The Onion for multiyear stints. At T2, Greer will now oversee the development team and guide the company’s technical growth. Image Credits: T2 screenshot Image Credits: T2 screenshot Also this week, T2 debuted a new verification process with the launch of its “Get the Checkmark” program timed to correspond to Twitter’s removal of legacy verification checkmarks across all users who aren’t paying for the Twitter Blue subscription. Twitter said its own checkmark removals will begin on April 1st and will include removing the verification from organizations and individuals who had previously qualified as “notable” under the company’s prior rules. Ahead of this change, T2 users who are legacy Twitter checkmark holders can claim their T2 checkmark by filling out this form and then following the subsequent email instructions which involve communicating with T2 via Twitter DM or reply. After April 1 (or whenever legacy checks actually disappear), will switch over to a new verification flow. For now, while the app is small and in closed testing, this will involve chatting directly with a T2 representative. (A process that would make it very hard for bots to be verified!) Later on, T2 plans to scale this verification using in-app identity and selfie checks. These will be designated as “T2 Authenticated” profiles and will have the standard verified check, not the ruffled edge version of the previously Twitter verified crowd. Too bad T2 still requires an invite to get in — this is clever marketing!       Image Credits: Flipboard Image Credits: Flipboard Image Credits: Chris Messina via Twitter

The San Francisco-based company is one of now several hoping to challenge Google by offering users a new way to ask and get answers to their everyday system. Notably, Perplexity’s CEO worked previously as a researcher at DeepMind and the Google Brain project. That connection has brought some half dozen AI researchers at Google and DeepMind as investors, including SVP for Research and AI, Jeff Dean. While Perplexity launched in December, it’s been recently gaining more traction, Bloomberg reported, with February’s 13 million visits more than double that of January’s. However, the company’s mobile app only launched this past week (March 28), offering a way for iPhone users to get instant answers on any topic with up-to-date (and cited!) sources. You can also ask the chatbot follow-up questions and engage with the app using either typing or your voice. Plus, you can keep your thread history to pick up where you left off. Noted one App Store review, “this really is too good to be true,” noting that the app was free to use despite all the functionality — making it a possible threat to OpenAI. Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple Apple’s new app for classical music, Apple Music Classical, is now available as a free download for Apple Music subscribers. At launch, the service will be available globally, except in select markets, including China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Taiwan and Turkey. However, Apple says it will arrive in these countries at some point in the future. The company said that there are more than 5 million tracks available on the app right now, as well over 50+ million data points with data attributes of 20,000+ composers, 115,000+ unique works and 350,000+ movements. This data helps Apple Music subscribers find recordings across the catalog through the app’s specialized search engine built for classical music. As Apple explains, classical works have multiple movements and tracks, while famous pieces have hundreds of recordings with different orchestras, conductors and soloists. In addition, many composers have their own special catalog classifications, which means classical music search has to be built differently with these complexities in mind. Because of these challenges, it’s been difficult to find classical works on traditional music streaming apps. In the new app, users can search for works using keyword combinations that include composer, work, opus number, conductor, artist, instrument or even the work’s name. Plus, when you look up a work on the app, you’ll find all its associated recordings as well as a hand-picked “Editor’s Choice” performance. Apple Music Classical’s editors created over 700 playlists to guide listeners through 800 years of music and plans to add more over time.

However, with the launch of its mobile app this week, Arc opted not to create another browser to compete with Safari. Instead, its app serves mainly as a mobile companion to Arc, offering users access to their Spaces and tabs from Arc for Mac while on the go, as well as the ability to save links from other apps to read later, and a way to view your saved Easels (a scrapbooking feature) and Notes. Arc is interesting because it’s trying to reimagine a basic part of everyday computing with an eye on the future — and it has a lot of fans. However, its focus is scattered, trying to solve many problems at once at the same time it’s inventing new tools to use, like its web scrapbooks which feels more like a standalone product idea that’s been mashed into a browser. The real test for Arc will be when it exits its private beta testing and opens to the wider public."
217,Ann Lai says she was fired from Bullpen Capital after helping deliver a $145M fund,['@nmasc_'],"May 1, 2023","Ann Lai, a general partner at Bullpen Capital, has been fired from the firm, she says. The investor described the termination experience as “discriminatory and retaliatory” in a LinkedIn post published on Monday. Lai helped raise Bullpen Capital’s most recent fund, a $145 million investment vehicle, the first investment vehicle in which she was named an equal partner. Before joining Bullpen Capital in September 2020, Lai was a principal at Binary Capital, co-founded by investor Justin Caldbeck. When she resigned from that firm she attributed it to the sexist behavior that she said she witnessed while there. She claimed that Caldbeck, who has been accused of sexual harassment in the past, told her he would blacklist her from the industry if she spoke up. Lai said that she filed a lawsuit — ultimately settled — to be able to break her NDA and tell others the reason behind her departure, as well as help others in the industry break past silence-guaranteeing contracts. Her return to investing was marked by her hire as a GP at Bullpen, as the firm’s first female partner and first partner of color. “The whole point of my original case [with Binary] is that such behaviors are not covered by non-disparagement,” Lai told TechCrunch. “I specifically carved it out of the GP agreement for Bullpen, not thinking that I was ever going to need it. If it were like any other time the only narrative would be theirs. And then I’d have no options.” It is TechCrunch’s understanding that Lai’s formal exit communications happened entirely through legal counsel. Lai did not accept a severance package from Bullpen Capital at the time of her termination. Asked for comment, she declined to say more, referring inquiries to her attorney Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan’s Michael Liftik, who declined to comment beyond providing the following statement: Ann did not choose to leave Bullpen and she was not presented with an opportunity to stay past the end of April. We believe she was forced out, illegally, because she was not afraid to speak her mind and share her views. While robust debate was apparently tolerated among the other white male partners, this was unacceptable when it came from Ann, the only woman and minority in the partnership. Ann remains committed to the diverse founders she brought to Bullpen and the LPs with whom she shared her vision for a data-informed diligence process. In a comment to TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Bullpen said that they are not going to comment on personnel matters. “We are disappointed by Ms. Lai’s recent comments about Bullpen, and we strongly disagree with them.” On LinkedIn, Lai described the partnership at the firm as an “all-white, all-male partnership” in which “‘equal’ wasn’t ever truly equal.” Of her time in the firm, she claims that she had to “defend female founders when they’re baselessly called ‘untrustworthy’ or ‘uncompelling,’” push for male founders within Bullpen’s network to undergo standard due diligence, and stand up for herself in meetings after being called “a waste of time” in partner meetings. The firm, through a spokesperson, said that Bullpen promotes “a collaborative culture of healthy debate and varied perspectives among our entire team, which is essential to finding unproven companies with high potential.” Bullpen added: “Our accomplishments in this area predate and are independent of Ms. Lai joining the firm, and our commitment is as strong as ever. We are focused on moving forward without compromising on our founding vision of partnering with strong founders with the perseverance to become market leaders and generating attractive returns for LPs.” Lai’s lawyer did not have a comment in response to Bullpen’s statement. Lai, meanwhile, told LPs in her post that she “was committed to delivering what we had marketed & promised for Fund VI. I would never quit so abruptly & irresponsibly.” As part of her termination, Lai was not allowed to stay on the boards of her existing portfolio companies — including ChairmanMe, built by CEO Sarah Lacy, a former journalist at TechCrunch. Bullpen continues to own equity in Lacy’s company, as one of its biggest investors. Lacy believes Lai’s experience is emblematic of a larger issue within Silicon Valley. She wrote a public LinkedIn post saying that what happened to Lai is an example of “why just hiring more female GPs has not changed this industry, about why despite the increase of women getting these jobs, the percentage of capital going to underrepresented founders has decreased. “ “Was it a feature or a bug that someone like Ann has been – once again – driven out for not playing the game?” Lacy wrote. Lai says that Bullpen has not yet been in touch with her since she went public with her account of the termination.

218,Substack’s new short-form ‘Notes’ feed looks a lot like Twitter,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 5, 2023","Substack announced today that it’s introducing a new Notes feature that is designed to let users share posts, quotes, comments, images, links and ideas. Notes shared on the platform are displayed in a dedicated short-form feed that looks a lot like Twitter. Once you share a note, it’s essentially like posting a tweet. Each note displays a like count and comment count. There’s also the option to “restack,” or retweet, a post. The company seems to agree that the new feature looks similar to Twitter, as Substack noted in its announcement post that Notes “may look like familiar social media feeds.” However, Substack argues that Notes differs from traditional social media feeds because it doesn’t run on ads. “The lifeblood of an ad-based social media feed is attention,” the company wrote in a blog post. “By contrast, the lifeblood of a subscription network is the money paid to people who are doing great work within it. Here, people get rewarded for respecting the trust and attention of their audiences. The ultimate goal on this platform is to convert casual readers into paying subscribers. In this system, the vast majority of the financial rewards go to the creators of the content.” Substack also argues that Notes won’t feel like traditional social media, and that the goal with the new product is not to create a “perfectly sanitized information environment,” but to allow for constructive discussion where there is enough common ground to seek understanding “while holding onto the worthwhile tension needed for great art and new ideas.” Image Credits: Substack Image Credits: Substack Given the company’s propensity to host controversial writers and the otherwise deplatformed, this direction with its Notes feed could see it wading even deeper into the culture wars surrounding what constitutes free speech. The more Substack associates its brand with the more extreme personal brands of divisive media personalities, the less it may be able to attract the larger (and typically more moderate) readers that constitute the majority of any network’s user base. The launch of Notes isn’t the only way Substack has attempted to capitalize on the Twitter chaos in recent months, as the company rolled out a Chat feature last November. It also took a more direct shot at Twitter, when it warned in a post last year that “Twitter is changing, and it’s tough to predict what might be next.” The post had encouraged creators of all sorts to port their Twitter follower base to Substack. The new Notes product, which is pretty much a Twitter clone, takes Substack’s hopes on capitalizing on the Twitter chaos even further. It’s worth noting that with Notes, Substack is not only taking on Twitter, where many back-and-forth threaded discussions between writers and readers already take place, but also other online communities where writers have been building out networks of their own, like Discord, Slack and Telegram. Today’s announcement comes a week after Substack opened up a community fundraising round, letting writers invest in and own a piece of the company. As of today, Substack has $7,138,675 in pledges. The company revealed that readers have paid writers more than $300 million through Substack, and that the platform now has more than 35 million active subscriptions, including two million paid subscriptions. Substack also revealed that more than 17,000 writers are earning money on Substack, with the top 10 publishers on Substack collectively making more than $25 million annually.  "
219,"TikTok ban will benefit Meta, Google and Snap the most: Bernstein",['@indianidle'],"March 23, 2023","If TikTok is banned in the U.S., Meta is likely going to be the biggest winner, alongside YouTube and Snap, according to research and brokerage firm Bernstein. Ahead of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew’s appearance in front of Congress on Thursday, the research firm said in a note to clients that Meta could quickly attract a lot of users and minutes spent on the app if the ByteDance-owned app is banned from the States. Chew is going to testify in front of Congress following multiple calls to ban the short-video app in the country and pressure on ByteDance from the Biden administration to sell TikTok U.S. or face a prohibition. “Users go where they already are. It’s likely Instagram’s Reels, where users are already watching the most short-form videos outside TikTok, and Snap’s Spotlight, which offers the highest demographic overlap with TikTok, that should be the big winners,” the Note said. Meta, Google and Snap could see a spike in revenue due to TikTok’s absence, which could likely also benefit their stocks, Bernstein’s note said. TikTok’s projected revenue in the U.S. was expected to be in the ballpark of $7 billion to $8 billion, the note said. “Ad dollars go where advertisers are most comfortable with the highest ROI. Meta once again looks the likeliest winner with best-in-class ad products, including SFV, while YouTube offers the highest overlap of branded campaign objectives. YouTube was also likely the largest share donor to TikTok ads, and could see ad dollars return home,” the note said. Users go where they already are. It’s likely Instagram Reels and Snap Spotlight that should be the biggest winners.
Bernstein Earlier this week, Chew said TikTok has more than 150 million users in the U.S. Bernstein estimates that collectively these users spend more than 2.8 trillion minutes per year on the app, which puts TikTok in the second spot for minutes spent per day per user (52 minutes), just behind Netflix. In 2020, India banned TikTok for its Chinese ownership and concerns over the app threatening “the national security and defense” of the country. Soon, local apps like ShareChat’s Moj, Times Internet’s MX Takatak (acquired by ShareChat) and Google-backed VerSe Innovation’s Josh quickly gained a bunch of TikTok’s users, international players like Instagram, YouTube and Snap also seized upon the opportunity with short-format videos. Bernstein noted that it doesn’t see a similar scenario of local TikTok clones rising up in the U.S. Given recent gestures from the White House, lawmakers and federal law enforcement agencies, Chew is in for a potentially harsh turn under the glare of the government’s big, bright lights. Ahead of his congressional testimony, Chew shared a prepared statement saying the belief that TikTok is “beholden” to the Chinese government is inaccurate. “… I understand that there are concerns stemming from the inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government,” Chew said. “This is emphatically untrue. Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country.” TikTok has spent more than $1.5 billion on Project Texas, which aims to appease American authorities regarding the safety and transparency of the app’s U.S. operations. The company has also highlighted how the app contributes to the economy by saying more than 5 million businesses are on TikTok. Plus, the app employs more than 7,000 people in the country. A set of creators, along with some Democratic representatives, are siding with TikTok and protesting the potential ban in Washington, DC. "
220,"Oh hey, Google just announced the Pixel Fold",['@bheater'],"May 4, 2023","Look, I’m not going to sit here and pretend that the entire world didn’t know this was happening next week, but is a bit of theatrics too much to ask? Google learned a few years back that the best way to juice a product hype cycle is to “leak” the thing yourself, and here we are, facing down a tweet that leaves very little to the imagination. The short video shows the company’s upcoming Pixel Fold unfolding slowly from every conceivable angle. Google’s using Star Wars Day as an excuse to fire up the old hype train, but the truth is it’s priming up the pump with less than a week before it returns to Shoreline for an in-person I/O. There were already a LOT of leaks and rumors floating around, so the company just went ahead and took matters into its own hands. There’s also an official Pixel Fold page where you can sign up for news and the like. There’s still some information that hasn’t been made official, including pricing and release date. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google As seen above, all previous leaks appear to have more or less been on the money. As the name implies, the form factor is more Samsung Galaxy Z Fold than Samsung Galaxy Z Flip — that is, more book than clamshell. The dimensions, on the other hand, appear a bit closer to Oppo’s recent foldable, or even Microsoft’s bygone Surface Duo.   Google has, of course, been laying the groundwork for its entry into space for a few years now. The company has been working closely with Samsung to create a version of Android that scales well to a foldable form factor. As evidenced by this year’s Mobile World Congress, the age of the foldable as a fringe device appears to be over. The list of big device makers that don’t have a foldable is growing shorter by the month — and even they are most likely working on their own version as we speak. The design language is in line with the rest of the Pixel device line, including the familiar camera bar, which houses multiple rear-facing lenses. There’s no visible internal camera, which means the company is either doing one under display (unlikely), or it’s using that fairly sizable bezel real estate to hide it. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google The front-facing screen looks larger as well, though it’s difficult to determine how close it gets to edge-to-edge, given that the video shows a dark clock face — perhaps by design. There does appear to be a visible crease on the inside screen, which showcases Android’s familiar Material UI design language. We can see power and volume buttons on the metal edge and speaker grilles up top. We don’t get a good view of the bottom, but it’s pretty safe to say we’re working with USB-C here. Overall, the device looks quite thin — which is especially important for a foldable. How to show excitement without shouting? Asking for a friend Coming to @Flipkart on 11th May. pic.twitter.com/il6GUx3MmR — Google India (@GoogleIndia) May 2, 2023  Google India also recently confirmed the budget 7A’s May 11 release date. And we’re expecting a lot more info on the Pixel Tablet, which was officially announced at last year’s event. So, will there be surprises at I/O? Maybe.

221,"Google Fi gets a rebrand, expanded smartwatch support, new free trial option and more",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 20, 2023","Google Fi, the cell phone carrier operated by Google, is getting a series of new updates and rebranding to Google Fi Wireless. The rebrand adds a bit of clarity about what exactly the service offers to its customers. As for the new updates, Google Fi Wireless is adding cellular connectivity for the Pixel Watch or Samsung’s Galaxy Watch line to its Simply Unlimited plan. Prior to this change, it was only available on Google Fi’s Unlimited Plus and Flexible plans. Customers with a cellular version of one of those watches can now add it to any Google Fi Wireless plan for no extra charge. Unfortunately, there’s no mention of Apple Watch support. Google Fi Wireless is also introducing a new free trial offer that lets you test out Google Fi Wireless at no cost if you have an eSIM-compatible device. The trial gives you unlimited data, calls and texts in the U.S., along with hotspot tethering, spam call blocking and VPN. “We invite anyone with an eSIM compatible phone interested in trying out Google Fi Wireless to sign up for our 7-day free trial to test our coverage at home, work or any of your favorite places before you move over,” the company wrote in a blog post. “The trial works right on your phone alongside your current service, and of course you can keep your same number.” In addition, the service is adding a new perk that gives customers a complementary phone for each line added to any plan, but the phones come with a 24-month commitment that requires customers to stay on the wireless plan. If you cancel the agreement before the 24-month period, you’ll have to pay the difference on what you still owe. Phones that customers will be able to choose from include the Google Pixel 6a, Samsung A14 and moto g power. Finally, Google Fi Wireless is rolling out a refreshed family-centric design of its app that is designed to make it easier for users to manage their family’s digital safety settings. The redesign makes it easier to do things like ensuring your child can only be called or texted by trusted numbers and the ability to add new members. The company says this update will start rolling out over the coming weeks."

223,Greycroft closes on over $1 billion across new funds,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 26, 2023","Greycroft, the self-styled “seed-to-growth” venture capital firm, today announced the closing of over $1 billion in capital commitments across new funds. The firm’s two flagship vehicles, Greycroft Partners VII and Greycroft Growth IV, closed on more than $980 million, according to co-founder and managing partner Dana Settle — cash that’ll be put toward investing in both early- and growth-stage enterprise and consumer businesses. “Greycroft’s bicoastal foundation in Los Angeles and New York has given us unique access and insights to the technological advancements that drive emerging themes and reshape industries at the intersection of culture and business,” Settle said in a canned statement. “Our investment approach remains the same, identifying companies that are finding novel applications of next-generation technology and supporting them at the critical moment of commercialization.”  Co-founded by Settle, Ian Sigalow and Alan Patricof in 2006, Greycroft manages more than $2 billion in capital with stakes in companies including Bird, Bumble, HuffPost, Goop, The RealReal and Venmo. The firm targets investments from $500,000 up to $50 million in early-stage and high-growth companies globally, with a presence in close to 20 countries. Greycroft’s growth funds allow for investment in growth-stage deals, with commitments starting at $10 million and scaling up to $35 million. Meanwhile, its venture fund invests between $500,000 and $5 million in a first check. Greycroft previously closed around $700 million ($678 million) across two funds, Greycroft VI ($310 million) and Greycroft Growth III ($368 million), which brought its total capital to $2 billion. Since 2006, the firm has grown from $75 million to $3 billion in capital commitments and partnered with more than 250 portfolio companies. “We are witnessing a once-in-a-generation industrial transformation driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and the increasing need for sustainable products,” Sigalow added in a press release. “These secular shifts are creating new opportunities across a wide range of sectors, despite the challenging economic conditions. We have been here before and are excited to see the innovations and trailblazing entrepreneurs that we anticipate will emerge from this period of change.”"
224,"At 0.69% in Q1, the dip in funding for Black founders ‘no longer evokes an emotional response’",['@dominicmadori'],"April 25, 2023","Black founders are seeing a year-over-year decline in Q1 funding, according to new Crunchbase data that looked at seed, venture, private equity and corporate venture capital funding allocated to Black entrepreneurs. This might be a good time to look for alternative funding avenues, according to founders TechCrunch+ spoke with. The dataset shows that in Q1 2023, Black founders raised an estimated 0.69%, or $312 million, out of the around $45 billion Crunchbase totaled for the quarter. Per Crunchbase numbers, Black founders saw a decrease in year-over-year funding from Q1 2022, when Black founders raised 1.5% — or $1.26 billion — out of the $81 billion allocated in private funding. That’s a 75.2% drop in funding. It’s not all bad news, though: Although funding dipped in the early half of 2022, it steadily increased from $191 million in Q3 to $279 million in Q4, jumping again to $312 million in the first quarter of this year.

226,"Netflix restructures its film units, aiming to make fewer (but better) original movies",['@aiishamalik1'],"March 31, 2023","Netflix is restructuring its film units and vowing to make fewer but better movies, according to a new report from Bloomberg, which Netflix partially confirmed. The report said the streaming giant is combining film units that produce small and midsize films, resulting in a handful of layoffs, including two longtime executives. Netflix told TechCrunch that these changes were made to simplify its structure and set it up for the next phase of its growth, but declined to comment on how many people were being let go. Scott Stuber, chairman of Netflix Film, has been looking to scale back the company’s output of films to ensure that more of them are high quality, according to the report. It appears that this change has already been implemented, as the report comes as Netflix recently revealed its 2023 original films lineup, which consists of 49 titles. In comparison, the company had 85 original films in its lineup last year. For context, a Netflix original refers to both the content that has been produced in-house and the content to which it owns the distribution rights. It’s unclear for now if Netflix would also be scaling back the addition of originals that it didn’t produce, but obtained the rights to — a move that would impact the output of new originals on the service. One of the executives leaving the company is Lisa Nishimura, who was behind the company’s foray into standup comedy and original documentaries, Netflix confirmed. Nishimura had worked on some of Netflix’s most popular titles, including “Making a Murderer,” “Power of the Dog” and “Tiger King.” Ian Bricke, who served as the vice president of Independent Original Film at Netflix, will also be leaving. Bricke played a big part of Netflix’s dominance in the rom-com space, as he spearheaded notable titles like “The Kissing Booth,” “Set It Up” and “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.” “Lisa Nishimura joined Netflix in the DVD days, and as the company moved into streaming, she built our original documentary and stand-up comedy divisions from the ground up, and established Netflix as a powerhouse in both spaces,” Stuber said in an emailed statement. “Ian Bricke has been at the company for more than a decade, building and leading our independent film team, attracting filmmakers like Tamara Jenkins, Nicole Holofcener, and Mark and Jay Duplass. We thank them both for their contributions to making us a world-class film studio and wish them the best for the future.” The handful of layoffs come after Netflix conducted a series of job cuts last year. In May 2022, the company laid off approximately 150 staffers. A month after that, the company laid off 300 more people, which represented 3% of its workforce at the time. Netflix then laid off another 30 employees in September who were part of its animation department. On the editorial side, Netflix laid off 25 people on its editorial staff just five months after launching its in-house Tudum publication. Earlier this year, Netflix boasted to shareholders it has successfully scaled its decade-long original programming initiative. “Now that we are a decade into our original programming initiative and have successfully scaled it, we are past the most cash-intensive phase of this buildout,” the company wrote to shareholders. “As a result, we believe we will now be generating sustained, positive annual free cash flow going forward.” Netflix is scheduled to report Q1 2023 results on April 18.

227,"China probes Micron for cybersecurity risks, urges Japan to stay out of US chip export curbs ",['@kateparknews'],"April 4, 2023","The U.S. and China chip battle continues to escalate. In China, the country’s cybersecurity watchdog has initiated a probe into U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology, according to a statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released on Friday. The development came on the same day that Japan announced plans to impose export restrictions on 23 types of equipment. Without mentioning China by name, the measures regardless are most likely to hit business between the two countries. The cybersecurity probe mirrors moves being made by the U.S. government against Chinese equipment makers over security concerns. “In order to ensure the security of the key information infrastructure supply chain, prevent network security risks caused by hidden product problems, and maintain national security,” the statement from the CAC noted.  Micron has said that business continues to operate as normal with and in China during the probe. Japan’s proposals for export restrictions on 23 types of equipment — hardware used to make the most advanced chip technology — are expected to be officially implemented in July. The list of equipment includes ultraviolet lithography, cleaning, deposition and etching, according to Japan’s trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura.  China being omitted in name comes at a time when relations are delicate between it and Japan. Beijing’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang, meeting with his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi this past weekend, has been working on dissuading Tokyo from backing U.S. semiconductor export restrictions on China.  According to prepared remarks issued by the Chinese foreign ministry, in a Sunday meeting with Hayashi, Qin criticized the U.S. over how it “brutally suppressed the Japanese semiconductor industry, and now it is repeating its old tactics against China. “Don’t do to others what you don’t want others to do to you,” the statement said. It also contained a warning: the restriction will “only stimulate China’s determination to become self-sufficient.”  In the wake of sweeping rules rolled out in the U.S. in October aimed at curtailing China’s ability to produce chips, the U.S., Japan and the Netherlands reached an agreement earlier this year to curb exports of chip manufacturing tools to China to prevent Beijing from developing advanced weapons for military use.    The limitations are not exactly a win-win, which complicates the situation. For example, they are likely to have a negative impact Japanese chip-making firms like Tokyo Electron, which has roughly 90% of the chip-coating and -developing equipment market. Screen Holdings, Advantest Corp and Nikon will also be impacted.   The Netherlands, home to chip manufacturing firm ASML, also pushed ahead with its restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment to China in March.  “Due to these upcoming regulations, ASML will need to apply for export licenses for shipment of the most advanced immersion DUV (deep ultraviolet) systems,” ASML said. “It will take time for these controls to be translated into legislation and take effect.” Seoul has yet to make a call on how it responds to Washington’s ban on chip-related technology exports to China. In late February, the U.S., Japan and South Korea held economic security dialogue in Honolulu, Hawaii, to discuss the semiconductor supply chain, the U.S. chip subsidies and emerging technologies amid the U.S.- China tech war.

228,"UK blocks Microsoft’s planned $68.7B Activision bid, saying it would ‘substantially weaken competition’",['@psawers'],"April 26, 2023","The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has confirmed that it intends to block Microsoft’s megabucks Activision acquisition, concluding that such a merger would create “…the most powerful operator” in the cloud gaming market. The CMA noted that with Microsoft’s current share of 60-70% of the U.K. cloud gaming market, acquiring Activision’s portfolio of games would “substantially weaken competition.” It added that Microsoft would also have the incentive to withhold such games from competing gaming platforms. By way of a brief recap, Microsoft first revealed plans to buy Activision in a whopping $68.7 billion deal last January, a move that would essentially make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue behind Tencent and Sony, while giving it direct control over mega-franchises such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. Last July, the CMA confirmed it was launching an antitrust investigation into the deal, then two months ago the regulator gave the strongest indication yet that it was gearing up to block the merger when it provisionally concluded it “could harm U.K. gamers” by creating higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation. Then last month, the CMA narrowed its position to focus entirely on cloud gaming, rather than console gaming. This is a position that the CMA has confirmed today, noting that while Microsoft could damage its closest competitor in the console market by withholding Call of Duty from Sony’s PlayStation, it believed that Microsoft would be “unlikely to do so.” It said this was because PlayStation has a “large and profitable user base that regularly buys Call of Duty,” and that losses from reduced sales to PlayStation users would outweigh any gains Microsoft were to attain from gamers switching to Xbox. With cloud gaming, however, the CMA notes that Microsoft’s market advantage owing to the proliferation of Windows and its “significant cloud infrastructure” businesses would give it a strong foundation on which to gain an unfair advantage if it were to acquire Activision Blizzard’s titles. “No other cloud gaming operator has this combination of advantages,” the CMA wrote. “Some of these strengths are already reflected in Microsoft’s current UK market share of cloud gaming of between 60-70%.” Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith issued a statement immediately after the CMA published its final position today, saying that Microsoft intends to appeal the decision while pointing to recent moves it has made to alleviate competition concerns, which includes signing deals that would make Activision Blizzard games available on rival devices. Smith wrote: We remain fully committed to this acquisition and will appeal. The CMA’’s decision rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns and discourages technology innovation and investment in the United Kingdom. We have already signed contracts to make Activision Blizzard’s popular games available on 150 million more devices, and we remain committed to reinforcing these agreements through regulatory remedies. We’re especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works. -Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President Indeed, Microsoft has made various commitments toward keeping Activision games on rival platforms including Sony, Nintendo and Steam for a 10-year period. However, the CMA has taken the position that Microsoft’s proposals can’t replace the existing “competitive dynamism,” and would merely compensate for the loss of competition through “obligations that would regulate its behaviour” for 10 years only. The CMA wrote: We had to consider how best to remedy these concerns. Preventing the merger would preserve the competitive dynamism and level of innovation that exists in the growing cloud gaming market. In contrast, Microsoft proposed a remedy that sought to compensate for the loss of competition with a set of obligations that would regulate its behaviour and how it did business for a period of ten years. Having carefully considered Microsoft’s proposal, we found that it would not restore the competitive dynamism that would be lost as a result of the Merger. We decided, therefore, that a remedy that preserves competition, rather than one that imposes global regulatory oversight, is the only effective and proportionate way forward. Activision Blizzard, for its part, does not mince its words in response to today’s news. A spokesperson said that the CMA’s report “contradicts the ambitions of the U.K. to become an attractive country to build technology businesses,” adding that it will “work aggressively with Microsoft” to appeal the decision. “The report’s conclusions are a disservice to U.K. citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects,” the spokesperson said. “We will reassess our growth plans for the U.K. Global innovators large and small will take note that — despite all its rhetoric — the U.K. is clearly closed for business.” It’s worth noting that the acquisition faces scrutiny in other regions around the world. This includes the U.S., where the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing to block the deal, though Microsoft did recently secure a dismissal in a separate private antitrust lawsuit brought about by gamers. Elsewhere, Europe has been mulling an in-depth probe for some time already. The European Commission (EC) had previously set a provisional deadline of 25th April to announce a decision, but this was recently moved to May 22. Early reports indicate that Europe could be set to greenlight the deal in the wake of further remedies offered by Microsoft. However, in being the first political entity to officially reject the acquisition, the U.K. may have set something of a precedent for what’s to come. “In prohibiting the deal, the CMA has not only put itself in the firing line of the merging parties, but also set an important precedent for the EU Commission and U.S. FTC whose deliberations are ongoing,” Alex Haffner, competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said in a statement."
229,Orbit Fab closes $28.5M Series A for on-orbit refueling capabilities,['@breadfrom'],"April 17, 2023","Orbit Fab, a company that wants to build a network of refueling stations in orbit, closed a $28.5 million Series A to launch more fuel delivery and infrastructure missions. The Colorado-based startup has developed a refueling port called the Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface (RAFTI), which can be integrated onto satellites and orbital servicing vehicles. Orbit Fab wants to launch on-orbit fuel tankers (which the company sometimes analogizes to gas stations) that can dock with any spacecraft outfitted with a RAFTI port. Without a way to refuel satellites in space, any given spacecraft’s useful life is limited by how much fuel it’s carrying at launch. This can make a satellite heavier and more expensive, and each maneuver costly. Orbit Fab says refueling could enable more extensive satellite servicing missions, rendezvous and proximity operations, in-space assembly, and other spacecraft maneuvers that could demand longer life spans, while driving the overall cost of operating a satellite down. Last August, Orbit Fab said it would deliver up to 100 kilograms of hydrazine to satellites in GEO for $20 million, starting in 2025. The company already has four launches booked over the next three years, including three missions for the U.S. Department of Defense. One of those missions, scheduled for early 2025, will see Orbit Fab’s RAFTI port integrated on military satellites so that they can be refueled by on-orbit hydrazine tankers. Overall, Orbit Fab has closed over $21 million in DOD contracts. Orbit Fab is also starting to close on commercial customers: The company inked an agreement with Astroscale to replenish its orbital service vehicles in geostationary orbit (GEO). In addition to the Series A, which Orbit Fab said was an up round, the company announced that it had doubled its team to 60 people over the past year and plans to hire at least another 25 this year. The up round was led by 8090 Industries, with additional investments by Stride Capital, Industrious Ventures, Lockheed Martin Ventures, Tribe Capital, Good Growth Capital, and Massive Capital Partners."
230,"After bootstrapping for five years, Instruqt raises a €15M Series A from Blossom Capital",['@mikebutcher'],"May 5, 2023","Netherlands-based Instruqt has a product allowing companies to more easily test how new software would run inside their organization. After bootstrapping its way to growth, it has now raised €15 million in a Series A round led entirely by Blossom Capital. It’s much easier to sell a software product into a company if they can see how it will run inside the organization in a live manner. So some startups have appeared where they run their SaaS product inside a sort of sandbox, so that the client company can see how it might work, without having to be fully deployed. Instead of brow-beating buyers why they should purchase their products, the platform puts buyers in the driver’s seat to experience a product hands-on. This mean the client gets a working demo of the product, without needing to commit a lot of time and resources, or perhaps even signing a contract. That’s a much more powerful way of selling a product compared to a theoretical “demo” which might look and sound good, but may end up being a a total disaster in practice. Some examples of companies offering products in this area are CloudShare, Skillshare and ReadyTech. Founded in 2018, Instruqt says it is in use by companies such as RedHat, MongoDB, Datadog and HashiCorp. They use it to build so-called “self-service demos” and free test drives for prospects. The company is led by CEO Coert Baart alongside co-founder and CTO Adé Mochtar. Baart was previously co-founder of XebiaLabs, which was sold in 2020 to TPG Capital for an undisclosed amount. Baart said in a statement: “Having been bootstrapped since day one, it was always going to take a VC who truly understood our vision for us to take outside capital.” “Instruqt hits the sweet spot for buyers and sellers alike when it comes to tackling the key challenges faced in all sizes and sectors of business,” added Ophelia Brown, founder and managing partner at Blossom Capital."

If you’re new to WiR, it’s the newsletter where TechCrunch recaps the week in tech that was. We get it — you’re a busy person. We all are. So what better way to catch up on what’s happened than in a summarized, bullet-point form? We can’t think of one — and trust us, we’ve tried. If you haven’t already, please subscribe to WiR so that you never miss a new edition. And make note (if you haven’t) of TechCrunch’s upcoming events, including the startup-focused Early Stage in Boston on April 20 and our mega-conference, Disrupt, in San Francisco on September 19–21. With the call to action out of the way, let’s get on to the news! Tragic killing: Bob Lee, the creator of Cash App and the former CTO of Square, was killed this week in a fatal stabbing in San Francisco. Romain writes that, before joining MobileCoin, Lee worked at Google for the first few years of Android, focusing on core library development. He then joined Square, the payment company that later became Block, and was an investor in startups, including SpaceX, Clubhouse, Tile and Figma. Twitter sends doge soaring: On Monday, Alex wrote that Twitter added the symbol for the cryptocurrency dogecoin to a place of prominence on Twitter.com, which had the effect of sending the value of dogecoin skyrocketing. Not coincidentally, Twitter CEO Elon Musk is currently embroiled in a lawsuit relating to the cryptocurrency — a suit in which Musk’s lawyers called dogecoin a “legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion.” Gen Z embraces Fanfix: More and more Gen Z users are hopping on the content creation train in an effort to earn a living beyond the typical 9 to 5 gig. However, given the recent drama surrounding major social media apps, many creators are getting worried. Lauren reports that’s why an increasing number of Gen Zers are jumping on Fanfix — a Patreon competitor that only allows clean content and enables influencers to earn money directly from their followers. A long-promised treadmill arrives: Startup Virtuix — which has long been promising a mass-market omnidirectional treadmill, raising more than $1.1 million on Kickstarter and $35 million from investors to bring it to market — has finally begun shipping a home version of its product. Brian reports that the $2,595 Omni One features some upgrades to Virtuix’s original, limited-production-run model, including a new tethering arm, and comes bundled with a customized Pico Neo 3 headset. Breaches at Western Digital: Data storage giant Western Digital confirmed that hackers recently exfiltrated data from its systems during a “network security incident,” Carly writes. The California-based company said in a statement on Monday that an unauthorized third party gained access to “a number” of its internal systems on March 26. Western Digital hasn’t confirmed the nature of the incident or revealed how it was compromised, but its statement suggests the incident may be linked to ransomware. Android apps gain deletion option: Ivan reports that Google this week announced a new account deletion policy for Android apps, providing apps that offer account creation an easy way to delete the account as well. Set to be enforced beginning sometime next year, the move follows Apple, which implemented a similar policy last June for apps on the App Store. A publisher-focused alt to Twitter: Post, a Twitter alternative of sorts that’s rethinking how publishers should engage with social media, has opened its doors to the public. Sarah reports that the startup, like others in this space, gained ground in the wake of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter as many began to look for a new place to read and discuss the news or share their own thoughts with their followers. But Post doesn’t want to be just another Twitter clone. SpaceX hype machine: More and more hype is building for the first orbital flight test of Starship, SpaceX’s ultra-heavy launch system. The hype started to reach a crescendo this week as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released an air traffic advisory identifying April 10 as a primary launch date. But the FAA has yet to issue the all-important launch license to SpaceX, Aria writes — a final regulatory green light that’s a nonnegotiable step before the company can conduct the test. TechCrunch ain’t just a wellspring of well-reported written pieces (how’s that for forced alliteration on a Friday?) — it’s a podcasting machine, too, wouldn’t ya know. On Equity, the team talked about Y Combinator’s demo day as well as Q1 numbers, deals of the week and venture activity in Latin America. TC’s Found podcast highlighted The Nudge, a text-based app that helps users make the best plans in their city. Chain Reaction — which was nominated for a Webby Award (voting closes April 20, by the way) — interviewed Arianna Simpson, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, about the firm’s focus on crypto investments.

Climate tech slowdown: Tim writes about the slowdown in climate tech deal-making, which is occurring as investors anticipate a recession in the coming months. Climate tech’s resilience up until now has led some to call it the ultimate “recession-proof” investment. Tim explores whether that’s still true. A glum Q1: Alex writes about how the global venture capital market shrank in Q1 2023 — and would’ve been even worse were it not for a few mega deals.

233,Fandom launches new creator initiative and invests in more original video content,['@laurenforristal'],"May 3, 2023","Fandom, the entertainment site and wiki hosting service, is introducing a new creator-focused initiative with the debut of Creator Class, new quarterly workshops for creators. It’s also launching a new portfolio of original video content featuring its acquired brands GameSpot, Metacritic and Screen Junkies. Targeting its top creators, the company on Wednesday introduced a new program for its website contributors or admins, aimed at helping them learn how to enhance their wiki sites. Creators can now access videos showing the behind-the-scenes of how the platform works, and Fandom staff will provide tips on content development and marketing. Creators also gain access to resource guides that include a series of challenges and prompts. Senior Social Media Coordinator Miranda Phaal will lead the first quarterly workshop and it will center around teaching creators how to boost their social media presence. The workshop will occur later this year. Fandom says its next workshop will potentially discuss streaming and video creation. Plus, the Creator Class sessions will feature the best wiki sites made by top contributors and admins in order to inspire others on how to enhance their own campaigns. An example of this would be “Memory Alpha,” a reference database that contributors built to provide “Star Trek” fans with all the information they need about the sci-fi franchise, including articles about all its shows, characters and timelines. Michael Chiang, Fandom’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch that Memory Alpha would likely be a helpful example for other creators to learn how to do. “It’s one of those things where in this new age of structured and relational data, it’s [something] we want to do more of. I think someday there may be a Creator Class about [Memory Alpha]. If this is something you want to do on your wiki… [how] they did it and the way that we’re supporting them on the back end,” Chiang said. Creator Class is a part of Fandom’s Stars program, which launched last year to recognize the hard work of its most dedicated contributors and provide them with workshops, awards and exclusive experiences like screenings and conventions, among other entertainment and gaming events. There are currently 230 contributors who are considered Stars, the company told us. Fandom predicts it will have more than 400 Stars by the end of 2023.   Earlier this week, Fandom also announced the launch of seven new shows catered to gamers and fans of entertainment. Gaming is Fandom’s largest audience, with 150 million monthly visitors. The first two shows to premiere were “Honest Trailers Presents,” a new spin on Screen Junkies‘ popular “Honest” series, and “The Kurt Locker,” where GameSpot senior producer Kurt Indovina explores current gaming trends, Screen Junkies is a YouTube channel with 6.8 million subscribers. It was acquired by Fandom in 2018. Known for its “Honest” web series that parodies movie and TV trailers, Screen Junkies is revamping the series to include TV theme songs, celebrities and commercials. The web series has approximately one million views each week, per Fandom. “Honest Trailers Presents” can be found on Screen Junkies’ YouTube channel and on Fandom in the Video tab. The first episode of “The Kurt Locker” was released on May 2 and titled “Are There Too Many Remakes?” Indovina talks about how many of the video games released in 2023 — such as Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space — are either remakes or remastered games. Episodes air every Tuesday. In addition to “The Kurt Locker,” GameSpot is launching six other shows. The new GameSpot shows will simultaneously air on its website, YouTube channel and the Fandom platform. Meanwhile, Metacritic is launching “Metacritic Review Lab” on Fandom Entertainment’s YouTube channel, where Fandom critics and data experts analyze new movie releases, such as “Across the Spiderverse,” “Fast X,” “Indiana Jones 5” and “Little Mermaid.” Metacritic will release two or three episodes each month.

234,Twitter Circle tweets are not that private anymore,['@asilbwrites'],"April 10, 2023","PSA: Do not post your deepest darkest secrets on your Twitter Circle. Numerous Twitter users are reporting a bug in which Circle tweets — which are supposed to reach a select group, like an Instagram Close Friends story — are surfacing on the algorithmically generated For You timeline. That means that your supposedly private posts might breach containment to reach an unintended audience, which could quickly spark some uncomfortable situations. I observed this bug when a tweet from someone I follow appeared on my For You timeline, but the retweet button was disabled, despite the person’s account being public. When I clicked on the tweet, it disappeared. I asked the tweeter if that post was intended for their Circle — which I am not in — and they confirmed this was the case. In this instance, their tweet was not a big deal — they posted about feeling left out for not watching “Succession” (honestly, same). But for users posting complaints about their job, gossip about their crush or even nudes, this bug can have serious repercussions. TechCrunch has spoken to multiple users who have also experienced this glitch firsthand; many more have reported the glitch in their tweets. Most often, it seems that Circle tweets are being surfaced in the For You timeline to users who follow the poster, but are not in their Circle. Others have reported that their Circle tweets are reaching even further than those who follow them. Confirmed someone I'm not even following was able to see a private Twitter Circle tweet (thank you @TheSahilDev) This hurts trust in the platform a lot. Should be top priority @TwitterEng pic.twitter.com/BCYPkikJ2p — Theo – t3.gg (@t3dotgg) April 8, 2023  “Twitter seems to be outright failing to filter out private content before serving it to users,” Theo Browne, a creator and former Twitch engineer, told TechCrunch. Twitter recently revealed the source code behind its recommendation algorithm, which uses multiple models to source, rank and filter tweets. Browne hypothesized that the sourcing model is surfacing private content, but these private tweets are not adequately being filtered out. “Our initial release of the so-called algorithm is going to be quite embarrassing, and people are going to find a lot of mistakes, but we’re going to fix them very quickly,” Twitter owner Elon Musk said in a Twitter Space. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ask Twitter for confirmation, since its public relations team was laid off, and now the press email auto-responds with a poop emoji. But based on Twitter’s track record under Musk’s ownership, it would be surprising if this bug were fixed sooner rather than later — and the “Chief Twit” seems to have focused his attention on other more pressing endeavors. Twitter Circle has been buggy for months, but until now, there was not substantial evidence that private Circle posts were regularly breaching containment. As TechCrunch reported two months ago, Circle tweets often show up without the green banner that indicates they’re only shared with this select audience. Still, these tweets only showed up for people in the Circle, and you could figure out that they were Circle tweets since they would not be possible to retweet. While that bug was concerning in itself, this glitch that exposes private tweets is even more dangerous. After laying off so many engineers, Twitter’s code has not quite been airtight. It’s possible, for instance, to see tweets from people who have blocked you, which poses yet another serious privacy concern. We all know that we should be careful what we say on the internet. On Twitter, be extra careful — your private musings are no longer as private as you think.  "
235,California seeks to force Tesla to comply with racial bias investigation,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 13, 2023","California regulators are taking legal action against Tesla to force the company to comply with a state investigation into allegations of unlawful harassment of and discrimination against certain Black Tesla workers. The California Civil Rights Department (CRD) said Thursday it is seeking a court order that will run parallel to the state’s current lawsuit into allegations of employment discrimination. The agency originally filed suit in February 2022 after receiving complaints from Black workers protesting “the near-constant use of racial slurs in the workplace and the presence of racist writing and graffiti in common areas of the workplace.” In a filing with the Alameda County Superior Court, the CRD said it had subpoenaed Tesla on March 3 for a deposition of an individual who has the most knowledge of “the alleged misconduct and related policies and procedures.” The CRD said in a statement that Tesla declined to make the individual available. “Tesla’s failure to comply with my office’s obligation to investigate allegations of workplace misconduct shows a lack of respect for the rights and well-being of their workers,” said CRD director Kevin Kish in a statement. According to court documents, Tesla didn’t respond to the CRD’s subpoena until the end of March, when the CRD resorted to sending over a Zoom link for the deposition. Tesla did respond to that, objecting to the deposition request on the grounds that the CRD abused its investigative subpoena power. The agency said Tesla claimed there wasn’t enough time to locate the witness. The CRD then offered a “tolling agreement,” an agreed-upon deadline between the agency and Tesla to pick a deposition date, but Tesla refused to compromise, according to court filings. Now the CRD is seeking an order to show why Tesla hasn’t “responded fully to the investigative discovery” and to force the automaker to comply with the CRD’s requests. And as a cherry on the cake, the CRD also wants Tesla to pay for attorney fees in the amount of $1,425. The CRD says under California law, it has the right and responsibility to investigate every complaint of civil rights violations. “The California Civil Rights Department will not accept any attempts to obstruct our investigation,” said Kish. “My office is simply seeking to fulfill its statutory duty to investigate allegations of discrimination. Tesla is not above the law.” Over the past year, Tesla has tried a number of methods to wriggle out of the CRD’s lawsuit. The automaker has attempted to pause the lawsuit and settle outside of court, to have the case dismissed and to petition against the CRD for allegedly failing to conduct proper investigations before suing the automaker — all of which were denied. Tesla also countersued the CRD for adopting alleged “underground regulations” in its investigations. The California agency’s lawsuit against Tesla is one of many accusing the company of allowing harassment — both racial and sexual — to run rampant at its factories. A California judge last week ordered Tesla to pay $3.2 million to a Black former worker at its Fremont factory. On Wednesday, the California Supreme Court allowed minority workers at the same plant to seek a court order requiring Tesla to acknowledge a climate of racial discrimination and take steps to end it. The justices unanimously denied Tesla’s petition to appeal a ruling in January, in which two Black employees sued for damages after suffering racial discrimination at the factory. The damage suit is expected to proceed as a class action, potentially on behalf of thousands of present and past employees, according to a lawyer for the plaintiffs as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. This is apparently the first time such a ruling has been made in California, and it will set a precedent for trial courts statewide. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about either the CRD’s court order or the state Supreme Court’s ruling."
236,A look at Sweden’s startup scene as Techstars drops Stockholm program,"['Anna Heim', 'Alex Wilhelm']","March 30, 2023","As the global venture capital market contracts following a historic investing boom, the downturn impacts each startup market differently. While we’ve given the United States’ startup ecosystem most of our attention lately, it’s time to broaden our perspective. And narrow our focus. In the wake of Techstars’ decision to discontinue its Swedish accelerator program, TechCrunch+ decided to dig into the country’s startup scene to understand how one smaller venture market is adapting to a changed investing climate. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Sweden, which has a population of around that of Michigan in the United States, punches above its weight in both cultural and business terms. Any fan of heavier music will rhapsodize to you about towering Swedish heavy metal giants like At The Gates, In Flames, Amon Amarth and Meshuggah. In business terms, Zettle, Ikea, Klarna and Spotify all call Sweden home. It’s clear, then, that while Sweden’s population doesn’t make it an instant powerhouse in terms of sheer scale, it’s a country with a history of creating and building things that the world welcomes. Surely that creates a good foundation for future startup activity; after all, Spotify is worth $25 billion by itself. Why can’t the country’s founders repeat the feat? Techstars CEO Maëlle Gavet declined to comment on the choice to leave Sweden on the record. So today, we’re looking at Sweden with a focus on Techstars’ exit and how local venture and startup actors view it. We want to know whether there are ameliorating circumstances for the decision that will help us better grok Techstars’ call, as well as the European startup market in general and Sweden’s in particular."
237,Tanso banks a seed for its CO2 footprint software for industrial manufacturers,['@riptari'],"April 19, 2023","Munch-based climate tech startup Tanso, which sells software to help industrial manufacturers carry out sustainability reporting and carbon accounting, has banked €6.5 million in early stage growth funding. The investment breaks down into a €4 million seed raise, led by Cologne-based investor Capnamic, with existing investors including as UVC Partners also participating; and €2.5M it took in last month via an EU innovation grant under the bloc’s EIC Accelerator program. The EU program aims to support homegrown startups to scale and the accelerator’s 2023 work program included “environmental intelligence” among a number of green tech areas of focus, aligning with the bloc’s overarching goal of becoming ‘climate neutral’ by 2050. We first talked to Tanso back in fall 2021 when its trio of founders had just nabbed pre-seed funding. Since then they’ve been busy — getting their first “climate intelligence” product to market and supporting a growing number of manufacturing businesses’ to report their carbon emissions. Tanso’s customers number in double digits at this point, per co-founder and CPO Gyri Reiersen. Tanso has also been growing: With the team now numbering around 20 and more hires on the way. Reiersen tells TechCrunch the startup has picked up customers around the German-speaking DACH region, which means in Austria and Switzerland as well as its home market of Germany. “The majority in industries such as automotive, machine manufacturing, and steel production,” she adds. “In the next phase, we look at other exciting industries in manufacturing and neighboring geographies.” The EU is expanding sustainability reporting requirements on companies, under regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) — as well as via emissions trading rules and mechanisms like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). And Tanso notes that from 2025 every company with an annual turnover of more than €40M and a balance sheet total of more than €20 million (or more than 250 employees) will need to calculate and publish its own carbon footprint as part of its annual reporting — so its building a suite of software tools in anticipation of rising demand. It suggests sustainability regulations are forcing more companies to make improvements to their products geared towards reducing emissions in order to stay competitive — pointing to household brand names like BMW and Bosch paying increasing attention to sustainability as a criteria for supplier selection, for example. “We believe that carbon will become a factor is procurement processes and suppliers benchmarked on their carbon performance. This means to win contracts, products need to be designed and manufactured with environmental impact factored in,” argues Reiersen. “We support our customers in benchmarking their products and companies with others and identifying hotspots and reduction potentials to stay competitive.” The core product, aka the Tanso Climate Intelligence Suite, was launched last fall. It remains focused on industrial manufacturing companies (so mostly medium-sized businesses) which Tanso argues are under particular pressure to decarbonize given how polluting heavy industry tends to be. It cites figures suggesting manufacturing companies are responsible for around a third of Europe’s carbon emissions but says many have not been caught by sustainability reporting requirements up to now. However a lot more of these manufacturers will be as the EU’s sustainability reporting requirements expand in the next couple of years. Tanso’s ISO-compliant software is designed to support its target industrial enterprise customers in calculating, managing and reducing carbon emissions — at both company and product level. “Our core product is the corporate carbon footprint (CCF) module, where companies set up a standard process to continuously manage their full carbon accounting for all worldwide production sites for full Scope 1-3 [emissions reporting],” explains Reiersen. “Smart imports and integrations automatically map raw data from ERP [enterprise resource planning] and logistic systems to emissions factors in our calculation engine. Thereby, we reduce effort and create the basis for solid data analysis, drilling down on the most granular level where it adds value to go deep. Customers can also set Science-Based Target (SBTi) conform targets, strategically plan their reduction measures according to their real emissions, and actively steer their emissions.” Tackling product carbon footprints (PCF) is about addressing “information bottlenecks in the supply chain”, per Reiersen, who flag an incoming launch in this area. “Next week, we will launch a simple PCF calculator for individual products together with Europe’s largest industry association VDMA [Germany’s Mechanical Engineering Industry Association] with over 3,500 members, to accelerate the information transfer in the supply chain. “We have already tested this with over 60+ companies in a beta phase. In addition to this, we develop currently automated PCF calculations for our customers’ full product portfolio, as well as a supplier engagement module to support suppliers in their PCF exchange. The largest hinderance for suppliers to sharing data is expertise in calculation and internal data complexity.” Reiersen says the plan for the latest funding injection is to move into the next phase of product development — which means making the software more modular so the startup can provide targeted support for both CCF and PCF calculation and optimization and mesh with more manufacturers’ needs. “To this end, we are significantly expanding our team and will hire a number of experts from the fields of life cycle assessments and data analytics to further develop and expand our product offering,” she adds, noting also that the funding will allow the startup to pour more resource into building additional product modules at the same time as ramping up the sales team for the core product. So it’s foot on the gas to help others take their feet off the gas. “Our mission is to not only have Europe’s industrial emissions as ‘carbon under management’ in our software but to unlock and accelerate the decarbonization we need to mitigate climate change,” she adds.

238,France moves forward with influencer bill cracking down on risky products and more,['@romaindillet'],"March 31, 2023","The lower chamber of the French parliament, the National Assembly, passed a cross-party bill that aims to introduce some new requirements for social media influencers. This is a preliminary vote as the bill will move to the Senate, but there’s a high probably that it will be adopted in a few weeks as all the 49 deputies who were present at the National Assembly voted in favor of the bill. This bill has been in negotiations for a while as Aurélien Taché, a deputy from the French green party, submitted a draft law back in November 2022. According to him, many influencers promote scams because there aren’t any negative consequence. Around the same time, French rapper Booba also started calling out scammers/influencers on social networks, which led to some widespread media coverage. The French government itself then started looking at this topic with the Ministry of the Economy conducting a public consultation to better understand the stakes. More recently, Arthur Delaporte and Stéphane Vojetta — a socialist deputy and a deputy from Emmanuel Macron’s party, respectively — then submitted another draft bill that would turn all this back and forth into an actual piece of legislation (with the government’s support). The result is today’s bill, which first defines what a paid influencer is. It’s someone who leverages their reputation to share content that promotes a product or a service in exchange for money or a benefit-in-kind. Influencers who meet these criteria will have to comply with new rules. A big change that is going to have a significant impact on influencer content is that influencers will have to disclose if they are using a filter or if their face and/or body have been photoshopped. This mention has to be visible at all time on the photo or video itself. With these constraints, the French parliament doesn’t want to punish influencers. It wants to protect social media users from mental health issues, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia or depression. The bill then lists some things that an influencer cannot do. In particular, if the bill passes, influencers won’t be able to promote cosmetic surgery, financial products and services (including cryptocurrencies) and counterfeit products. In some cases, influencers can still promote products and services like before, but they need to add an informational banner about the risks involved. That new restriction applies to betting and gambling services, as well as video games that have features that could be considered as betting or gambling. If they are promoting a training program, they will have to name the training company behind it. Influencers will also have to be more transparent with dropshipping products. For instance, influencers can’t promote products that don’t meet the European certification requirements as those products shouldn’t be sold in Europe in the first place. When influencers accept a paid promotion, they will have to state clearly that it’s a paid promotion. If they fail to meet these requirements they will face up to six months in prison and a fine of €300,000. So it’s clear that influencers and media agencies will pay attention to these new restrictions."
239,Apple spotted developing a ‘multiview’ feature for watching sports on Apple TV,['@sarahintampa'],"March 29, 2023","Earlier this month, YouTube TV launched a new “multiview” feature that allows viewers to watch up to four streams of sports content at once. Now it looks like Apple TV is working on a similar option. Though Apple’s streaming device already supports a picture-in-picture mode, new code discovered in the latest iOS beta points to a possible four-up multiview feature in the works. The discovery was found in the iOS 16.5 beta 1 build by developer Steve Moser, which was first reported by the Apple news site 9to5Mac. Like the YouTube TV feature, the focus for Apple’s multiview experience now in development seems to be targeting supporting sports content more specifically. That decision makes sense not only because of the broader competitive landscape — including multiview options on services like YouTube TV and Fubo — but also because of Apple’s more recent investments in streaming sports content. Last year, the Cupertino-based tech giant announced its first-ever live sports deal with Major League Baseball to bring a number of games exclusively to Apple TV+ in multiple countries, including the U.S. It then began streaming Friday Night Baseball during the 2022 season, which was offered to viewers without the need for an Apple TV+ subscription. This year, the free offering was dropped and the games now require an Apple TV+ subscription, but the service is now available to subscribers in 60 countries worldwide instead of the original 13. The company also last year signed a 10-year streaming deal with Major League Soccer to stream every MLS match starting in 2023. However, Apple reportedly exited talks to secure the rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket over issues that had to do with the limitations on the package, including the ability to stream games worldwide, among other things. Still, it’s clear that Apple sees sports content as an area of investment for its streaming service, which would make a feature like multiview more useful to Apple TV customers. The new report noted that references to multiview had appeared in the iOS codebase previously, but the new beta saw more references than before, which indicates the feature is now being more actively worked on. Moser told TechCrunch there was a reference to “Watch in Multiview” from four weeks ago, for instance. The code also reveals more about what to expect from the offering, including how it appears to be tied to Apple’s TV app, as opposed to being a feature that would work across Apple TV devices. Plus, it seems that the end user may be prompted when browsing sports content in the app to try the option — for example by asking the viewer if they want to watch in full-screen mode or in the “Multiview” mode. Apple hasn’t announced the feature officially and would never confirm in-development plans, as a general rule. However, a recent Bloomberg report indicates that the company’s next big software release, iOS 17, will ship with several “nice to have” features. What those features may be is not yet clear, but multiview could possibly be among them."
240,Samsung surpasses Apple in smartphone shipments by 1% amid persisting market decline,['@indianidle'],"May 5, 2023","Samsung overtook Apple through a slender 1% lead to secure the top spot in smartphone shipment volumes during the first quarter of 2023, despite the ongoing contraction of the smartphone market, according to a new report. The South Korean electronics giant shipped a total of 60.6 million units, narrowly surpassing Apple’s 58 million in the quarter ending March, according to research firm Counterpoint. The overall smartphone market saw a year-on-year decline of 14% and a quarter-on-quarter drop of 7%, resulting in a total of 280.2 million shipment units in Q1 2023, the Hong Kong-headquartered firm said in a report. Concurrently, revenues experienced a 7% year-on-year reduction, reaching a record-low of $104 billion. While Samsung took the lead in shipment volumes, Apple maintained a commanding first quarter in terms of operating profits, securing a substantial 72% lead over Samsung. The iPhone maker also captured half of the market’s revenue, maintaining a 31% advantage over its South Korean competitor, Counterpoint added. Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, attributed Apple’s resilient performance to the enduring loyalty of its customer base. The company’s thriving ecosystem discourages consumers from seeking out less expensive alternatives, while its strong presence in the refurbished market — accounting for over 50% of the sector — bolsters its performance, he said. “Apple is able to weather economic and other fluctuations better than its rivals while enjoying unflinching loyalty. This also meant Apple was able to meet the demand for the iPhone 14 series which spilt [sic] over Q4 2022, when it had problems at its Zhengzhou factory, rather than that share dissipating or transferring to rivals,” Fieldhack said. Counterpoint’s projections align with recent findings from Canalys, another research firm. Apple officially echoed some of this performance on Thursday, disclosing in the quarterly earnings that it sold $51.3 billion worth of its marquee devices in the quarter ending March. But the road ahead is likely to remain tough. For a variety of reasons, we might see a few more declining quarters, according to Counterpoint analyst Tarun Pathak. “The persistent issues affecting the smartphone market are unlikely to abate anytime soon. Moreover, the recent decision by OPEC countries to cut oil production may lead to higher inflation rates, causing a reduction in consumers’ spending power,” he said. The industry-wide downturn has had a noticeable impact on the financial outcomes of numerous major players in the smartphone market. Samsung Mobile Division’s latest result suggested its revenue was down 2% year-on-year. Meanwhile, Samsung as a company, registered a 95% dip in profit due to sluggish chip demand. Earlier this week, chipmaker Qualcomm’s shares fell after it disclosed a 17% decline year-on-year across smartphone processor sales."
241,"Yeah, the data is bad, but I’m still optimistic about emerging managers",['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 14, 2023","Emerging managers have been on the same roller coaster as startups for the last few years. Funding to these young firms swelled in 2021 as venture was hot overall, but in line with the broader market, fundraising has slowed to a trickle since the beginning of 2022. The trend continued into 2023. New data from PitchBook shows that U.S.-based emerging managers raised a collective $1.62 billion in Q1. This doesn’t put this group on track to reach the volume seen in 2022, which was $37.26 billion. That was already down from the $55.81 billion the year prior. Experienced managers raised more than $10 billion in Q1 2023. Emerging managers raised 14% of the total capital raised, which is the lowest percentage in years. Vincent Harrison, a venture analyst at PitchBook, said it doesn’t look like the tough environment for emerging managers will let up anytime soon, either. “This is somewhat to be expected; 2022 was a rough year,” he told TechCrunch+. “The market is so reactionary. As things went down in the public market, people naturally were more cautious. Given that it’s a risky asset class, it affects people’s willingness to put money into it.” But, I don’t know, I just can’t seem to shake my optimism about these young investors."
242,NBCUniversal reports higher Peacock losses as it shows CEO the door,['@laurenforristal'],"April 27, 2023","Peacock losses continue to widen this quarter, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast reported Thursday, just days after the company announced that Jeff Shell’s time as NBCU CEO was up. Peacock had $704 million in losses in Q1 2023, a significant jump from $456 million in the same year-ago period. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Peacock reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $978 million. The company previously warned shareholders that it expects losses to peak at around $3 billion this year. However, Peacock also experienced subscriber growth, adding two million paying subscribers to bring the total to 22 million, up from 20 million in the previous quarter — a significant increase compared to the prior year when it had 13 million paying subs. Peacock saw revenue jump 45% to $685 million. Comcast announced Monday that Shell is leaving the company, effective immediately, following an investigation into a complaint of an inappropriate relationship within the company. In the interim, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh will take on Shell’s duties. “Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal. I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret. I’m truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege,” Shell said in a statement. CEO of Comcast Brian L. Roberts addressed the departure during Thursday’s earnings call. “Let me just acknowledge the news that you all saw earlier this week. Obviously, a tough moment. But we are so fortunate to have a fabulous and tenured leadership team at NBCUniversal,” Roberts said. “We’re also lucky to have Mike Cavanagh step in at the helm at NBCUniversal while also remaining president.”   The subscriber gain is a small win for the streamer as its larger rival Disney+ dipped in subscribers for the first time, losing 2.4 million global subscribers to bring the total to 161.8 million. Netflix missed analysts’ expectations in its first-quarter earnings, only reporting an addition of 1.75 million subscribers versus the estimated 2.3 million. “We delivered strong first quarter results as our team executed exceptionally well,” Roberts wrote in today’s letter to shareholders. “We grew Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS and generated a significant amount of free cash flow. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. Also, importantly, we had solid revenue growth in our high-margin connectivity businesses while increasing our Peacock subscribers more than 60% year-over-year.”"
243,TikTok hit with $15.7M UK fine for misusing children’s data,['@riptari'],"April 4, 2023","TikTok has been issued with a fine of £12.7 million (~$15.7M) for breaching U./K. data protection law, including rules intended to protect children. The privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), announced today that it found the video sharing site “did not do enough” to check who was using their platform and failed to take sufficient action to remove the underage children that were using the service. Per the ICO, TikTok had an estimated 1.4 million underage U.K. users during a two-year period, between May 2018 and July 2020 — which its investigation was focused on — contrary to terms of service stating users must be 13 or older. The U.K.’s data protection regime sets a cap on the age children can consent to their data being processed at 13-years-old — meaning TikTok would have needed to obtain parental consent to lawfully process these minors data (which the company did not do). “We fined TikTok for providing services to U.K. children under the age of 13 and processing their personal data without consent or authorisation from their parents or carers. We expect TikTok to continue its efforts to take adequate checks to identify and remove underage children from its platform,” an ICO spokesperson told us. Additionally, the ICO found TikTok breached transparency and fairness requirements in the U.K.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — by failing to provide users with proper, easy-to-understand information about their data is collected, used, and shared. “Without that information, users of the platform, in particular children, were unlikely to be able to make informed choices about whether and how to engage with it,” the ICO noted in a press release announcing the penalty for misusing children’s data. Commenting in a statement, John Edwards, the U.K. information commissioner, added: There are laws in place to make sure our children are as safe in the digital world as they are in the physical world. TikTok did not abide by those laws. As a consequence, an estimated one million under 13s were inappropriately granted access to the platform, with TikTok collecting and using their personal data. That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll. TikTok should have known better. TikTok should have done better. Our £12.7m fine reflects the serious impact their failures may have had. They did not do enough to check who was using their platform or take sufficient action to remove the underage children that were using their platform. TikTok was contacted for comment on the ICO’s enforcement. The company told us it’s reviewing the decision to consider next steps. In a statement a TikTok spokesperson said: TikTok is a platform for users aged 13 and over. We invest heavily to help keep under 13s off the platform and our 40,000 strong safety team works around the clock to help keep the platform safe for our community. While we disagree with the ICO’s decision, which relates to May 2018 – July 2020, we are pleased that the fine announced today has been reduced to under half the amount proposed last year. We will continue to review the decision and are considering next steps. TikTok claims it has taken a number of steps to address the issues it’s being fined for today. Although it continues to deploy an age-gate in which users are asked to input their date of birth in order to create an account (meaning that, if they’re underage, they can lie to circumvent the measure). However it says it supplements this with beefed up systems and training for its safety moderation team to look for signs an account may be used by a child under the age of 13 so they can flag accounts and send them for review. It also claims it promptly responds to requests from parents to remove underage account — and uses other information provided by users, such as keywords and in-app reports, to help surface potential underage accounts. TikTok further suggests it has improved transparency and accountability in this area — saying it produces regular reports about the number of underage users removed from the platform (in the last three months of 2022, it said the figure stood at over 17 million suspected underage accounts removed globally; but it does not report this data a per country basis); as well as offering family pairing to help parents keep tabs on kids’ usage. Despite the social media platform being found to have breach the U.K. GDPR on lawfulness, transparency and fairness grounds over a two year period, it’s only facing a penalty in the double digits — far below the theoretical maximum (of up to 4% of global annual turnover) — so the settlement looks pretty generous to TikTok. The figure is also notably less than half the amount originally proposed by the ICO, back in September, when the regulator issued a provisional finding saying it could fine the company up to £27M ($29M) for what were then a range of suspected breaches. The reason for the substantial haircut to the size of the fine is a decision by the regulator not to pursue a provisional finding related to the unlawful use of special category data following representations from TikTok. Under the GDPR, special category data refers to particularly sensitive classes of information, such as sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political affiliation, racial or ethnic origin, health data, biometric data used for identification — where the bar for lawful processing is higher than for personal data; and if consent is the basis being relied upon there’s a higher standard of explicit consent. This means, last year, the ICO had suspected TikTok of processing this kind of information without a lawful basis. But the company was able to persuade it to drop that concern. It’s not clear exactly why the ICO dropped the special category data line of investigation. But in response to questions from TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the regulator suggested it boils down to a lack of resources — telling us: We took into consideration the representations from TikTok and decided not to pursue the provisional finding relating to the unlawful use of special category data. That does not mean that the use of special category data by social media companies is not of importance to the ICO. But we need to be strategic about our resources and, in this case, the Commissioner exercised his discretion to not pursue the provisional finding related to the unlawful use of special category data. This potential infringement was not included in the final amount of the fine set at £12.7 million, and this was the main reason why the provisional fine was reduced to £12.7M. The amount of this fine has been set in accordance with our Regulatory Action Policy. The ICO does have a history of inaction over systematic breaches by the behavioral advertising industry — and its failure to clean up the tracking-and-targeting adtech industry may complicate its ability to pursue individual platforms that also rely on data-dependent tracking, profiling and ads-microtargeting to monetize a ‘free’ service. Children’s data protection has certainly been a stronger focus area for the U.K. watchdog. In recent years, following pressure from campaign groups and U.K. parliamentarians, it set out an age appropriate design code that’s linked to GDPR compliance (and therefore to the risk of fines for those who ignore the recommended standards). Active enforcement of the kids’ privacy and safety Code kicked off in September 2021. Although it’s fair to say there hasn’t been a tsunami of enforcements as yet — but the ICO has been undertaking a number of investigations. With the U.K. no longer a member of the European Union, the ICO’s enforcement of the GDPR is U.K.-only — and it’s worth noting TikTok’s business remains under investigation in the EU over how it processes children’s data. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) opened an investigation of TikTok’s handling of children’s data back in September 2021. That pan-EU probe is ongoing — and we understand the European Data Protection Board is expected to have to take a binding decision to settle disagreements between DPAs on Ireland’s draft decision, so there could be many more months for the process to run yet. Also ongoing in the EU: An investigation by the DPC of TikTok’s data transfers to China since the GDPR also governs data exports (which is of course a very hot topic where TikTok is concerned these days). One point of comparison: Last year, rival social network Instagram was fined €405M for misusing children’s data under the EU’s application of the GDPR. Although, in that case, the penalty reflects cross-border data processing activity across the 27-Member State bloc — whereas the ICO’s enforcement of TikTok is conducted on behalf of only U.K. users, hence some of the difference in size between the penalties levied.

244,Oura/Best Buy partnership brings the smart ring to 850 stores across the US,['@bheater'],"April 24, 2023","It’s been a whirlwind few years for Oura. The hardware-maker rode the early days of the pandemic to the top of the wearable ranks, establishing itself as the top smart ring maker by a mile. With the promise of detecting early COVID warning signals, the company struck up brand partnerships with some of the world’s leading sports leagues. Oura has had its share of controversy along the way, including the addition of a premium service that locked existing features behind a paywall. This time last year, the company announced that Tom Hale joined up as CEO, with a stated goal of scaling the company. Today’s news is a major step in that direction, as the company announces a deal with Best Buy that will bring its ring to around 850 locations around the U.S. “Brick-and-mortar retail is a natural next step for Oura and marks a pivotal moment for the business as we continue to expand into the mainstream,” Hale says in a release. “Introducing more people to the benefits of Oura’s technology and providing an impactful in-store and online experience with the help of Best Buy is an exciting step forward for us as a company.” The in-person experience is an important one for wearables. After all, products designed to be worn on your person represent an extra level of intimacy you don’t get with standard consumer electronics. It’s a pretty good idea to try something on before plunking down a few hundred dollars plus subscription fee. Oura does have some brick and mortar presence already, but nothing that rivals the Best Buy deal. The list includes limited availability in Gucci and Therabody stores, as well as SoftBank retail locations in Japan."
245,Otterize raises $11.5M to help developers securely connect software services,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 13, 2023","Tomer Greenwald, Uri Sarid and Ori Shoshan, software developers by trade, found themselves building and configuring software authentication and authorization mechanisms repeatedly — each time with a different tech stack. Frustrated with the process, they sought to create a platform that enables developers to focus on writing code rather than on constantly configuring server permissions. So Greenwald, Shoshan and Sarid, the former CTO of MuleSoft, founded Otterize, which aims to allow developers to securely connect different software services to each other and infrastructure by automatically configuring existing security controls. Otterize today raised $11.5 million in a seed funding round led by Index Ventures with participation from Dig Ventures and Vine Ventures, Jibe Ventures, Crew Capital and Operator Partners. “Most software these days is composed of multiple services that call each other,” Greenwald told TechCrunch via email. “With Otterize, developers can make those calls securely by simply declaring, alongside their code, the calls their code intends to make.” As Greenwald went on to explain to me, Otterize uses declarations to set access controls to allow intended calls — and block any unintended ones. If one service is compromised, it can’t be used to compromise other services it wasn’t intended to call. As an added benefit, Otterize provides a real-time map — Greenwald calls it an “access graph” — of all the services in the software app’s backend and how they’re calling each other, which certificates they’re using, how they’re protected and what remains to be secured. Developers can embed Otterize’s open source solution in their development pipeline or opt for Otterize’s newly launched fully managed solution, Otterize Cloud. Image Credits: Otterize”The way most access control mechanisms work, someone has to keep track of what services should be allowed to access another service, data source or API. That’s tedious, error-prone and requires being an expert at every technology used for authentication and authorization,” Greenwald said. “With Otterize, no knowledge is required from developers of how these technologies work, and maintenance happens automatically based on the one source of knowledge likely to always be correct and up to date: the developers of the code making those calls declare their need when they build it.” Otterize currently isn’t generating revenue — it has only offered a free service until recently — and wasn’t willing to talk about its customer base. Asked about the broader slowdown in tech and headwinds like the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, Greenwald expressed confidence that Otterize’s focus on “responsible growth” and “prioritizing product-market fit” position the company well. Time will tell. But one factor in Otterize’s favor is the heightened spending on cybersecurity, particularly in the enterprise. According to a 2021 survey from JumpCloud and ESG Research, 97% of security executives planned to expand or continue existing spend on identity and access management tools. Beyond access management, 65% of organizations plan to increase spending on cybersecurity this year, an ESG Research poll found. Gartner predicts that global spending on security and risk management will grow by more than 11% in 2023, up to $188 billion from just $158 billion in 2021. “By taking a measured approach to growth, we’re able to ensure that we’re providing value to our customers and building a sustainable business behind that value for the long-term,” Greenwald said. “Otterize is pioneering a new approach for access controls, automating the provision and maintenance of necessary access without human coordination, in so doing also securing the entire ecosystem of services based on least-privilege principles.”"
246,First drive: The 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 is a swoopy EV sedan that stands out in an SUV crowd,['@abigailbassett'],"April 3, 2023","In a world where nearly every automaker is pushing bigger, heavier, battery-electric SUVs and crossovers that all look the same, Hyundai is bucking the trend with its brand new, swoopy, tech-forward 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 sedan. The stakes are high for the Hyundai Ioniq 6. Hyundai has cast the sedan as a worthy rival to the Tesla Model 3, an EV that has dominated the market. The Ioniq 6 is also a key product in the automaker’s plan to sell 1.87 million EVs annually by the end of the decade and gain a 7% market share in the global battery-electric vehicle market. (Hyundai plans to invest more than $10 billion toward accelerating electrification and autonomous vehicle technology in the U.S. by 2025 to help it reach that goal.) The 2023 Ioniq 6, which will be available this spring, hits most marks. It’s quiet, quick and efficient and manages a roomy interior despite its sporty exterior. But will it attract buyers? Here’s our first impressions after a few hours driving the compact sedan in Orange County, California, near Hyundai’s North American headquarters, as part of the World Car Awards testing. Hyundai is offering customers a variety of options for the Ioniq 6 sedan, including 53 kWh and 77.4 kWh battery pack sizes and two motor layouts. Regardless of the trim level, the Ioniq 6 sedan sits on the same E-GMP platform that underpins the Ioniq 5. All of the variants come with the same 800-volt architecture as the Ioniq 5, with a few small tweaks that make the sedan more efficient and gives it more than 50 additional miles of range over the award-winning crossover. At the top of the heap — at least in terms of range — is the Ioniq SE long range rear-wheel drive version, which is outfitted with 18-inch wheels and a 77.4 kilowatt-hour battery pack that provides an estimated EPA range of 361 miles. The Ioniq 6 SE long range is priced at $45,500 (or $46,615 including delivery). The most affordable version is the Ioniq 6 SE standard range, which has a base price of $41,600 ($42,715 including delivery), that is equipped with a 53 kWh pack and a rear electric motor that provides an EPA-estimated range of 240 miles. The AWD long-range model has an EPA-estimated range of 316 miles and a base price of $49,000 ($50,115 including delivery). Several other trims that include the larger 20-inch wheels have ranges between 270 and 305 miles. The base model of the Ioniq 6, in rear-wheel drive format, offers 225 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the dual-motor, all-wheel drive version that I drove has 320 horsepower and 446 lb-ft of torque. Tesla has three versions of the Model 3, only two of which are currently available. The Model 3 rear-wheel-drive sedan can travel 272 miles on a single charge and has a base price of $42,990. The Model 3 dual-motor performance version has an EPA-estimated range of 315 miles and a base price of $53,990. The long-range Model 3, which has 358 miles of range, is currently not available. Customers who only care about an EV with the most range for the lowest price might find the cheaper Ioniq SE long-range rear-wheel drive version (361 miles for $45,500) more appealing than the higher-priced Model 3. The Ioniq 6 also gets an EPA-estimated 140 MPGe combined, which happens to match the two Lucid Air models at the top of the EPA’s Top Ten list. The impressive range is due in part to the Hyundai Ioniq 6’s very low drag coefficient of just 0.22. Hyundai said it was able to achieve that through a combination exterior and functional design features, including the swoopy roofline, ducktail spoiler, active air flaps, wheel gap reducers, boattail shape, full underbody cover, deflectors and reduced wheel-arch gaps. In typical Hyundai manner, the Ioniq 6 comes standard with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, as well as other safety features. The adaptive cruise control is comfortable in stop-and-go traffic, neither leaving too much of a gap nor accelerating too fast, only to slam on the brakes. It drives like a well-behaved, non-texting human being, which is a welcome feature in LA’s stop-and-go traffic. Image credit: Hyundai Image credit: Hyundai On the road, the design of the Ioniq 6 stands out. It looks a little bit like a VW Beetle and a Hyundai Sonata got together and had a good-looking baby, with plenty of tech-forward features, including more than 700 Parametric Pixels in, on and around the vehicle. The end result is a sedan that feels more sci-fi than the other “meh” options on the road today. The loop I drove took us out on the crowded 405 highway in Southern California and up into the area around Tustin and Lake Forest, California. The drive took place mostly on fast-moving toll roads with sweeping turns. Because I was in a prototype, I had Hyundai handlers in the vehicle with us the entire day, which prevented us from deviating from the prescribed path. In spite of these constraints, the limited time I spent behind the wheel of the new Ioniq 6 did prove that it was a capable, comfortable, quiet and quick machine on the road. The Ioniq 6 has four modes: eco, comfort, sport and snow. Because I was driving in Southern California and not heading to altitude, I didn’t get a chance to try out snow, but did experience eco, comfort and sport modes. In eco mode, the compact car doesn’t lag or feel as if it’s being restricted. It is a bit less punchy in eco mode, especially when you first step on the accelerator. In comfort mode, the performance ticks up a notch, but it still isn’t the throw-you-back-in-your-seat experience that customers have come to expect in an EV. (The less-is-more approach makes sense since Hyundai expects that most people who purchase the little EV will have little to no experience with EV torque and acceleration.) In sport mode, however, the Ioniq 6 is much more spirited, offering that true EV experience of sharp acceleration. Hyundai says that the vehicle can travel from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds in the dual motor, all-wheel drive configuration. One of the somewhat niggly things about the Ioniq 6, which owners will get used to quickly, is the location of the gear selector. Like the Ioniq 5, the 6’s selector is located on the steering wheel column and is a bit hidden behind the wheel itself. Once you locate it, you rotate the end of the knob on the stalk to put the car into drive and press the end of the stalk to put it into park. Image credit: Hyundai Image credit: Hyundai Inside the Ioniq 6, customers will discover a minimalist and spacious interior. While the wheelbase of the Ioniq 6 is 116.1-inches, it’s shorter than the Ioniq 5 by two inches. Surprisingly that doesn’t translate to a cramped interior, thanks to Hyundai’s thoughtful layout and interior design inside the cabin. As an example, designers minimized the size of the door armrests to provide more hip width inside the vehicle. There’s plenty of room in the back seats for a six-foot person to ride comfortably for a good long while, too. A pair of screens stretch from in front of the driver to the passenger under one piece of glass. The driver’s information screen and infotainment screen each are 12.3-inch displays, with the infotainment screen getting touch capabilities. Image credit: Hyundai Image credit: Hyundai The vehicle during my test was a prototype, forcing me to use Android Auto for navigation. I didn’t get the chance to try out some of the features that Hyundai includes with the Ioniq 6, including Bluelink, phone as a key and the on-board navigation system. Bluelink is Hyundai’s app that allows owners to see details like battery usage, locate chargers and even manage charging time to help cut down on electricity costs. The Hyundai Ioniq 6 also comes with a digital key 2.0 system that allows owners to use their iPhone, Apple Watch or a Samsung Galaxy smartphone to lock and unlock the vehicle and start it. The feature also allows for key sharing with family members. Once you put a linked iPhone or Samsung Galaxy on the wireless charger, or hold an iWatch near it, and push the start button, the Ioniq 6 will start up. The voice recognition system, which allows users to control the temperature, radio station and other controls using simple language prompts, was intuitive if a little bit slow. This could be because I was driving a prototype. We’ll have to wait and see what the Ioniq 6 is like in a longer-term test once the vehicle lands on U.S. shores. Hyundai says that the Ioniq 6 can go from 10% to 80% charged in just 18 minutes on a 350 kW charger (DC Fast). However, I didn’t have the opportunity to try out the vehicle’s fast-charging capabilities during this first impressions drive (I will once I have the vehicle longer than a day). The company also included a charging feature that allows the Ioniq 6 to accept 400-volt charging without an adapter by using an inverter and a motor to boost 400 volts to 800 volts. The sedan also includes battery conditioning so that when a charging destination is put into the onboard navigation system, the vehicle will automatically pre-condition the battery to prepare it to take maximum charge. Like the Ioniq 5 before it, Hyundai has also included V2L (vehicle-to-load) functions in the sedan. That means that customers can charge electric bicycles, scooters, camping equipment or even charge a stranded EV (1.9 kW peak power using a standard 120-volt outlet) by plugging into the Ioniq 6’s accessory adapter and outside charger located near the charging port. Hyundai has managed to find a balance between standout design, technology, range, performance and price. Hyundai may have produced a vehicle that will make the transition from gasoline to EV much more comfortable for the average buyer."
247,"With latest hit Lemon8, ByteDance again learns from the China playbook",['@ritacyliao'],"April 7, 2023","Amid a wave of heated debate over whether TikTok should be banned, another ByteDance product, Lemon8, has popped up and quickly climbed into the top 10 on America’s app stores. Lemon8’s sudden rise is reminiscent of TikTok’s early-day growth. At the time Vine had already pioneered short-video sharing in the U.S., but TikTok took the media format to the next level through its content recommendation algorithms, a system that had proven immensely successful in China for its sister app, Douyin. Some industry observers are now describing Lemon8 as something at the crossroad of Instagram, Pinterest and Amazon, but those familiar with the Chinese internet ecosystem would immediately recognize that the app is an instance of “copy-from-China.” For much of China’s early internet history, entrepreneurs found inspiration in trends with strong momentum in the U.S. and built something comparable in China, giving rise to the country’s answers to Google, Facebook and the likes. That practice is still here, as indicated by the clutch of companies that express their ambitions to become China’s OpenAI; but a reversal of the trend is also taking shape as China’s homegrown tech talent becomes more sophisticated and comes up with increasingly novel services that don’t yet exist abroad. At a glance, Lemon8’s photo-heavy layout and peer-to-peer reviews strike a great resemblance to Xiaohongshu, the Chinese social commerce platform with 260 million monthly active users. Xiaohongshu, which means “Little Red Book,” has over the past decade become the go-to online community for Chinese youngsters to learn life hacks in areas ranging from maternity health and surviving centralized quarantine in China to finding the best Chinese restaurants in Düsseldorf. Bike sharing, live shopping and social commerce are a just few Chinese internet business models that have found users abroad. Xiaohongshu has dabbled in other Asian markets through Uniik and Spark, but neither took off. Now ByteDance is taking the playbook of Xiaohongshu westward, mirroring what TikTok has done with learning from Douyin’s model back home. Image Credits: Xiaohongshu Image Credits: Xiaohongshu Founded as a platform for sharing overseas shopping guides, Xiaohongshu has mostly kept its focus on corralling practical information. Posts are arranged in a Pinterest-like grid but ranked partly by the number of “saves” they get. And unlike Instagram, there’s little competition to post the most glamorous photos. Rather, images are used to contextualize the notes posted by users, such as a COVID-19 PCR result needed to board a flight to China. Rather than favoring professionally made influencer posts, the app encourages the discovery of long-tail content and stresses relevance over entertainment. When users are on Xiaohongshu, they are experiencing what’s called “zhongcao,” literally “planting grass,” a concept popularized by the platform to convey the effect of wanting to buy something after seeing someone else, whether a friend or influencer, recommends it. Of Xiaohongshu’s 260 million MAUs, 69 million of them are content creators, the company said at a recent event. Seventy percent of its users are female and born after 1990. Most of its users live in China’s more prosperous, top-tier cities. At its peak, the company’s valuation reached $20 billion but reportedly dropped to $10-$16 billion last year as China’s tech crackdown dampened investor confidence. It’s too early to say if Lemon8 can bring the zhongcao culture to the U.S. and beyond. For now, most of the app’s traction seems to stem largely from splashy advertisements and influencer endorsement through TikTok. There are also signs that Lemon8 is paying influencers to post content. This is a common practice seen amongst Chinese social media platforms, including Douyin. But this might also be the biggest difference that separates Lemon8 from Xiaohongshu, which has rarely shelled out large subsidies to influencers. Authenticity, many argue, is the reason Xiaohongshu’s content has stood the test of time. In its infancy, Lemon8 is probably still far from thinking about monetization, but it’d be interesting to see what steps it takes to make money if and when the app accumulates a sizable user base. It might look to Xiaohongshu, which currently monetizes through ads and e-commerce commissions. Of course, it’s never easy to simply transport an existing business model from one country to another, be it copy to or from China. Even ByteDance has struggled to evangelize live shopping, which is now driving a big chunk of Douyin’s China revenues, in Western countries.       "
248,Lun is in a mad rush to help heat-pump installers decarbonize homes,['@riptari'],"March 23, 2023","Lun, a climate tech startup out of Denmark, is on a mission to help homes decarbonize fast — starting with heating systems and swapping out boilers for electric heat pumps. What are heat pumps? The technology is a low carbon form of heating which is based on the principle of refrigeration that offers an alternative to environmentally unfriendly options like oil and gas-fired boilers. At a basic level, heat pumps work by using electricity to transfer heat from one place to another, so they’re able to both heat a house in winter and cool it in summer (or at least up to a balance point at which a supplemental system may be required). There are several different types of heat pump (air-source, water-source, ground-source etc); and installations need to start with an assessment of the property which needs to consider a variety of factors before being able to go ahead — such as which type of pump is appropriate to the given property, land and climate; where to site units and components and whether to reuse elements of an existing heating system; how well (or poorly) insulated the property is; and even whether the heat pump brands a particular tradesperson prefers to work with are appropriate for the job in question. The need for all this detailed up-front assessment complicates the sales process for heat pump installations — and that, in turn, slows down the decarbonization of households. Since in-demand plumbers and electricians may simply decide it’s easier to focus on other types of work (including, climate-horror-of-horrors, installing more fossil fuel burning boilers that pump CO2 directly into the atmosphere). Helping redirect the energy (ha!) of installers towards decarbonization via fitting more heat pumps is what Lun hopes to do by building a platform for tradespeople — which it dubs an installation “operating system” — to provide them with “full stack” support so they can get on with ripping out boilers and replacing them with heat pumps. And, as they earn money doing that work, help decarbonize the planet faster. Its software, which is currently in an alpha release with an undisclosed number of testers in Denmark, aims to take some of the strain out of installation assessments, design and planning, as well as handle other business elements like taking payments. It’s providing tradespeople with a suite of tools for gathering relevant data from householders and automating suitability assessments — doing the latter by drawing on public and/or open data (such as satellite imagery), as well as feeding in data from OEMs (such as price, specifications), as well as property type/location etc, to try to find the best match between a job and a professional installer. “We start very small,” says co-founder and CEO Martin Collignon. “We start with where they lose the most time — which is in sales. Many of them go visit homes way too early, before they actually know whether the customer is interested or not. Or whether the house is relevant or not. And that’s what we focus on and then we build on the the entire stack all the way to payment… to make sure that they’re supporting every part of the journey. And they could focus on what they’re good at, what they trained at, and what they earn money on — which is installing the heat pump.” “We want to make them more efficient,” he continues. “So right now around 40% of the time spent on heat pump sales and installation is spent on not installing the heat pump… So we just want them to be able to do more heat pump installations, over the year, because they have less of the other stuff to do — the sales, the design, the procurement, the financing, the paperwork, the compliance work, finding other [tradespeople]… all these things. “We want to make it automated, with the technology in there, so they don’t have to spend time doing that… And the result of that is that doing heat pump work will be at least as profitable as the other task — and hopefully more profitable — so they can focus on heat pumps because it’s just a great job for them. So it’s not as much of a pain in the butt as it is today.” “It’s an industry that is less digitalized than most… and our goal — and what we really focus on — is [building] a product that they see as a no brainer,” Collignon adds.  “That’s really the challenge because they’re busy enough. So we really need to build something that they love. And that’s what we focus on right now.” Heat pumps are also just the start for Lun — as he says the big vision is for the platform to support tradespeople who’re able to apply a full sweep of renewable and decarbonizing technologies. Whether that’s installing electric charging points for vehicles, fitting PV panels to generate solar energy, or electrifying stoves. (In some rural regions of Europe solid fuel and/or wood burners for home heating are still absolutely a thing!) Other startups are also looking to grease the pipe of household renewables — from the likes of Germany’s Zolar, Spain’s Samara, US-based OpenSolar or Are Solar, to name a few (there are also others focused on HVACs, such as US-based Conduit Tech) — but such is the scale of humanity’s home decarbonization task it’s going to take several villages’ worth of startups attacking the problem from as many angles as possible as fast as humanly possible. Or, as Collignon says, the more the merrier. “We focus on heat pump now but our goal, our mission is to decarbonise homes faster in general,” he tells TechCrunch. “Heating is the major lever — that’s 80% of the energy consumption — but there’s a bunch of other things that we need to think about. “So the goal really is that we can be the platform that all the tradespeople that want to aspire to be professionals in renewable technologies and decarbonisation technologies for buildings they can use that platform. And we focus very much — and will focus for a long time — on retrofits. So that’s taking the old buildings that we have and making them modern, more clean, more affordable [not dependent on] of fossil fuels that come from bad places around the world, basically.” The Copenhagen-based startup was founded at the end of March last year, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. The war triggered a major crisis around Europe’s energy needs, amping up the argument for transitioning away from gas — now on geopolitical grounds, as well as the climate crisis. The Ukraine war was the final catalyst for the co-founders to formally incorporate Lun, per Collignon. He’s a climate activist turned tech founder who before all this worked in the tech industry — for giants including Google and Uber. But after several years of grinding away at the Big Tech coalface he says he got “very, very badly” burnt out and decided to refocus his priorities. Then, along with his co-founder Anders Valentin — who brings a background in insurtech to the venture; and was a friend of Collignon from their business school days — the pair set about figuring how they could make maximum impact in the climate fight. Fast. And they landed on streamlining the installation of heat pumps. “The simple reason we looked at heat pumps was it was mentioned in all the climate reports — you could find from the IPCC to the IEA to the European Union, everything — everyone mentioned heat pumps. But when we started looking at it, a bit more than two years ago, it was still a very niche technology where demand was the main issue but we knew from all these reports that they would change, hopefully soon, to a supply problem,” he explains, fleshing out their rational for starting with what’s still a pretty unfamiliar technology in many European markets. (Figures for installations can vary considerably depending on the country but overall numbers are still low; market data from the European Heat Pump Association puts the total figure of regional installation at 16.98 million or around 14% of Europe’s heating market.) “So we started looking at what will be the issue — not now but really in five, seven years from now — for the industry. And it became very clear that [tradespeople] would become — very fast — a bottleneck… Plumbers is already the profession that we lack the most in Europe, way ahead of software engineers, for example. So we were really thinking it seems unlikely that we’re going to get more [tradespeople] before 2030 if you look at all the reports, so the only way we could solve this is really make the task of installing renewable technology into something more interesting — more economically viable — for these [tradespeople]. Because, if you think about it, they can do a bunch of other things… So that’s how we started looking at the problem. That’s what we’ve been doing since.” Lun is being buoyed up in its decarbonization mission by closing a new round of funding — €10.3M in seed funds, which it’s announcing today — topping up a €550k pre-seed it raised previously to build its MVP. The seed funding comes from new investors including Norrsken VC, Partech, Lowercarbon Capital, and MCJ Collective as well as existing investor Foundamental. (Xoogler Ventures and other angel investors also backed its pre-seed.) The funds will go on continuing to build out the product — making sure it delights the target user so Lun can get more of the critical skilled installers on board. It is also eyeing European expansion and Collignon notes it has an early partner in Austria so that is likely to be one of the next markets. Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Chris Sacca, founder of Lowercarbon Capital, said: “Getting off gas for heat isn’t just critical for the climate, if you live in Europe it’s the patriotic thing to do, and Lun is the cheapest, fastest, and easiest way to get an electric heat pump installed.” “Changing the way we consume energy in our homes should be a top priority for everyone for many different reasons: Climate, health and economic well-being,” added Agate Freimane, Norrsken VC, in another supporting statement. “We were impressed by Lun’s speed of execution and excited to be supporting them on their journey.” Foundamental’s Patric Hellermann dubbed electrifying buildings “top of mind” in the climate fight — with the “No.1 bottleneck” being making more installer-time available — going on to pronounce that Martin and Anders “have cracked that code with their software” in another statement. Lun is a for-profit venture, despite its high worth climate mission. So what’s the business model? That’s still a work in progress, per Collignon, who says it’s exploring different revenue streams — potentially a subscription fee or a transaction model. He suggests they could also look to tap revenue streams around financing or even the heat pump hardware itself. “Your heat pump is quite an expensive thing — that can cost between €15,000 to €25,000 in many places — so we think there’s different ways where you can take a small cut of that. Basically, if you make things more efficient,” he adds. When does he predict a tipping point for consumer uptake of heat pumps? And a mass move away from fossil fuel burners that we all desperately need to see happen ASAP. “When it’s worthwhile for consumers,” he responds on that. “I’ve worked in climate tech for quite some time and… it’s always the technology that makes it affordable for consumers that wins, basically, not the one that’s the greenest. So we need to make sure that it’s economically advantageous to instal heat pumps — and to instal these technologies more than anything else. “I believe that when that will happen is when it becomes worthwhile. Which it was last year — when the gas prices were insane. And then now we see some countries moving with certain bans [on installing gas boilers after particular cut-off dates] and certain de facto obligations to instal heat pumps as your next in technology. Then that’s of course a game changer. And I believe that’s going to happen in more places.” Another decarbonization ‘lever’ Collignon says he’s personally fought for in Denmark is making sure the “externalities of using fossil fuels are priced correctly”, as he puts it. Or reform of energy markets and taxation systems to support consumers to make green choices — so there’s definitely work for regulators to be getting on with here too. “Make sure you have a carbon tax that reflects the impact on the climate, basically, and if that happened, then it would be very obvious very very, very fast that it’s a lot better to use a heat pump — economically, for climate, for geopolitics etc — than it is today,” he adds.

249,"Andreessen Horowitz is now openly courting capital from Saudi Arabia, despite US strains",['@cookie'],"April 1, 2023","Andreessen Horowitz is openly courting capital from Saudi Arabia, despite U.S. strains. According to Bloomberg, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to talk for at least the second time since November about their firm’s $350 million investment in Flow, Neumann’s new residential real estate company. Their choice of venue was intentional: The conference was organized by a nonprofit backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds, and Flow may launch in the Kingdom, says Bloomberg. The three reportedly laid it on thick, with Horowitz praising Saudi Arabia as a “startup country” and saying that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.” Neumann separately also said, “It’s leaders like his royal highness that are actually going to lead us where we want to go.” We reached out to Andreessen Horowitz with related questions this morning and have yet to hear back. It isn’t shocking to see a firm of Andreessen Horowitz’s size and interests looking to cement relationships in Saudi Arabia. Though the 14-year-old outfit has never made public who its limited partners are, no one would grab at their pearls were it to be revealed that sovereign wealth funds from the region have helped boost the assets under management at the firm to $35 billion across its many funds. Indeed, back in October, Horowitz spoke at an investment conference dubbed “Davos in the Desert,” which is often a clue that someone is fundraising. As for more explicit associations, in 2016, both Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund sold some of their shares in ride-sharing company Lyft to Saudi Arabia’s Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and his Kingdom Holding. In 2017, Andreessen also joined forces with the prince’s first cousin, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (“MBS”), agreeing to join the advisory board of MBS’ ambitious project, Neom, a group of futuristic tech-driven communities with its own laws across “an area the size of Massachusetts,” as the WSJ describes it. If Andreessen stepped off Neom’s board in 2018 after the CIA concluded that MBS ordered the gruesome murder of a Washington Post columnist, he didn’t share if he did so. In fairness, neither did some of Neom’s other high-profile advisory board members, including Travis Kalanick or Sam Altman. Only then-Apple-design-chief Jony Ive disappeared from the list nearly as quickly as he was added, with Apple calling his inclusion “a mistake.” All the while, plenty of big U.S. businesses have continued to conduct business in the region. KKR and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund still work together routinely. JPMorgan said it planned to expand its operations in Saudi Arabia late last year. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and BlackRock signed an agreement a few months ago to explore infrastructure projects in the Middle East. (Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is also an LP in BlackRock.) Yet, venture firms, which tend to paint themselves as more virtuous than other asset providers, have mostly remained secretive about any ties to the region. That makes yesterday’s comments by Horowitz at the Miami event all the more notable. From Bloomberg’s story: Onstage at the conference . . . Horowitz lamented that after Andreessen, the co-founder of their eponymous venture capital firm, had written a blog post in 2020 arguing it was “time to build,” it made waves, but not much changed in the U.S. “Probably 50 people in the U.S. government reached out to Marc to talk to him about it, and absolutely nothing happened,” Horowitz said. But when Horowitz visited Saudi Arabia in October and ate lunch with Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, and more recently, met with the governor of its sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, they were enthusiastic. Al-Rumayyan told him, “Let’s go,” and “within a week we had a half-dozen really interesting meetings set up,” Horowitz said. “In April, we’re bringing our companies out to Saudi. And that’s what a startup feels like.” So, what changed? The American economy, for one thing. U.S. companies are grappling with tighter lending and higher inflation. Comparatively, energy prices have left funds from Saudi Arabia to Qatar managing more than $3.5 trillion, according to a Bloomberg estimate in January, which also noted that the amount exceeds the UK’s GDP. In so openly praising its friends in Saudi Arabia, Andreessen Horowitz further appears to be aligning itself with other global investment firms that are unapologetic about their relationship with the oil-rich region. If they can do it, so can we, may be the thinking. Andreessen Horowitz may also be betting that the U.S. will be forced to reconsider its relationship with Saudi Arabia despite its repressive regime. Consider: After President Joe Biden reluctantly visited MBS last summer, asking him to lower gas prices, MBS instead hiked them during U.S. midterm elections in a show of power. Empowering MBS further, a U.S. federal court in December dismissed a lawsuit against the crown prince over the Washington Post columnist’s murder after MBS was named prime minister of Saudi Arabia by his father. (MBS was already the de facto ruler of the Kingdom, but the move gives him immunity, by the standards of the U.S. State Department.) Whether other powerful venture firms follow Andreessen Horowitz’s lead will be interesting to see. Though the firm has in many ways reshaped how the wider venture industry operates, publicly aligning itself with Saudi Arabia is a bigger gamble than, say, launching a stand-alone media property or jumping headlong into crypto. While MBS may be making progress on a global comeback, U.S. concerns continue to abound as his country draws nearer to China to develop a nuclear energy program that the U.S. doesn’t want it to build. That’s saying nothing of MBS’ friendly relationship with Vladimir Putin, whose war on Ukraine is believed to have already cost hundreds of thousands of people their lives, or of Yemen, where the Kingdom’s protracted war has created what is now the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. It’s worth remembering, too, that business is done differently in Saudi Arabia, no matter how successfully the region portrays its wholesale transformation. In one telling example, last summer, according to the WSJ, after their fans drove two video game companies to cancel sponsorship deals with Neom over Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, Neom CEO Nadhmi Al-Nasr called an emergency meeting to complain to his communications team. Wanting to know why he wasn’t warned the game companies might pull out, he reportedly told his employees, “If you don’t tell me who is responsible, I’m going to take a gun from under my desk and shoot you.”"
250,"Anthropic’s $5B, 4-year plan to take on OpenAI","['Kyle Wiggers', 'Devin Coldewey', 'Manish Singh']","April 6, 2023","AI research startup Anthropic aims to raise as much as $5 billion over the next two years to take on rival OpenAI and enter over a dozen major industries, according to company documents obtained by TechCrunch. A pitch deck for Anthropic’s Series C fundraising round discloses these and other long-term goals for the company, which was founded in 2020 by former OpenAI researchers. In the deck, Anthropic says that it plans to build a “frontier model” — tentatively called “Claude-Next” — 10 times more capable than today’s most powerful AI, but that this will require a billion dollars in spending over the next 18 months. When contacted for comment, an Anthropic spokesperson said: “We are planning additional product announcements and will be talking about them soon.” The Information reported in early March that Anthropic was seeking to raise $300 million at $4.1 billion valuation, bringing its total raised to $1.3 billion. The deck confirms that target number, though only half was raised at the time of the document’s creation from a “confidential investor.” Anthropic describes the frontier model as a “next-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching,” making reference to an AI training technique it developed called “constitutional AI.” At a high level, constitutional AI seeks to provide a way to align AI with human intentions — letting systems respond to questions and perform tasks using a simple set of guiding principles. Anthropic estimates its frontier model will require on the order of 10^25 FLOPs, or floating point operations — several orders of magnitude larger than even the biggest models today. Of course, how this translates to computation time depends on the speed and scale of the system doing the computation; Anthropic implies (in the deck) it relies on clusters with “tens of thousands of GPUs.” This frontier model could be used to build virtual assistants that can answer emails, perform research and generate art, books and more, some of which we have already gotten a taste of with the likes of GPT-4 and other large language models. “These models could begin to automate large portions of the economy,” the pitch deck reads. “We believe that companies that train the best 2025/26 models will be too far ahead for anyone to catch up in subsequent cycles.” The frontier model is the successor to Claude, Anthropic’s chatbot that can be instructed to perform a range of tasks, including searching across documents, summarizing, writing and coding, and answering questions about particular topics. In these ways, it’s similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But Anthropic makes the case that Claude is — thanks to constitutional AI — “much less likely to produce harmful outputs,” “easier to converse with” and “more steerable.” Anthropic released Claude commercially in March following a closed beta late last year, allowing around 15 partners initial access. It counts among its beta users and potential customers the following industries (with the asterisk indicating that a human is in the loop to supervise the model): Dario Amodei, the former VP of research at OpenAI, launched Anthropic in 2021 as a public benefit corporation, taking with him a number of OpenAI employees, including OpenAI’s former policy lead Jack Clark. Amodei split from OpenAI after a disagreement over the company’s direction, namely the startup’s increasingly commercial focus. Anthropic now competes with OpenAI as well as startups like Cohere and AI21 Labs, all of which are developing and productizing their own text-generating — and in some cases image-generating — AI systems. OpenAI has by far raised the most in terms of capital, recently securing a reported $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion. “Anthropic has been heavily focused on research for the first year and a half of its existence, but we have been convinced of the necessity of commercialization, which we fully committed to in September [2022],” the pitch deck reads. “We’ve developed a strategy for go-to-market and initial product specialization that fits with our core expertise, brand and where we see adoption occurring over the next 12 months.” The pitch deck reveals that Alameda Research Ventures, the sister firm of Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed cryptocurrency startup FTX, was a “silent investor” in Anthropic with “non-voting” shares — responsible for spearheading Anthropic’s $580 million Series B round. Anthropic expects Alameda’s shares to be disposed of in bankruptcy proceedings within the next few years. Google is also among Anthropic’s investors, having pledged $300 million in Anthropic for a 10% stake in the startup. Under the terms of the deal, which was first reported by the Financial Times, Anthropic agreed to make Google Cloud its “preferred cloud provider” with the companies “co-develop[ing] AI computing systems.” Other Anthropic backers include James McClave, Facebook and Asana co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and founding Skype engineer Jaan Tallinn."
251,Greywing’s new SeaGPT solves email overwhelm for maritime crew managers,['@catherineshu'],"April 24, 2023","Every time a member of their crew changes, maritime crew managers need to handle immigration regulations, COVID requirements and travel plans for each person. This is usually done through emails with port agents, and can quickly lead to an overwhelming number of messages, sent across multiple time zones, especially if multiple people are leaving or onboarding. To simplify the process, Greywing, the Singapore-based maritime intelligence platform backed by investors like Flexport and Y Combinator, announced today it has developed SeaGPT, an AI chatbot based on GPT4 tech. In a statement, Greywing CEO Nick Clarke said email overwhelm is the top problem crew managers ask them to fix. SeaGPT is latest of the startup’s tools for automating crew changes. The current version (Greywing plans to continue developing it and adding new use cases) simplifies the process by automating parts of the communication process, like drafting emails with important questions and extracting the most essential information from port agency replies for specific crew members. Greywing co-founder and chief technology officer Hrishi Olickel told TechCrunch that SeaGPT isn’t a plug-and-play generative AI chatbot, but was made possible by advancements with GPT4 and a maritime-specific approach to programming. He added that email overload affects how many vessels a crew manager can handle at a time and their ability to gather information for decisions. “If a single decision, like a port agent for a single crew change, has information spread out over seven emails and replies inside PDFs and Excel files, the chances for human error are higher. In addition, maritime is a global industry. When time zones aren’t favorable, crew managers either have to be available 24/7 or face multi-day turnaround times for a conversation.” As an example, one of Greywing’s customers had an injured master that needed to be evacuated from his ship immediately. This meant that the crew manager had to find the closest port to the right medical facilities. But since they were near new ports, a massive amount of emails needed to be sent to coordinate his departure. Olickel said SeaGPT could have whittled that time down from hours to minutes. So how does SeaGPT work? It’s currently available through Greywing’s platform, Slackbot and its mobile app, with plans to add integrations to WhatsApp and Teams. Users can ask SeaGPT questions like “set up a crew change for me in Melbourne.” Olickel explains that crew managers who are in the process of switching out crew members need to know how much it will cost for each person leaving and if there are any restrictions, including COVID vaccination requirements and immigration regulations, that they need to be aware of. After receiving a request, SeaGPT, which is connected to Greywing’s proprietary database covering 18,300 ports, looks through all the information and comes back with the necessary information. It then asks questions like what type of vessel is involved, the nationality of people onboarding and offboarding and their names. That info is used for SeaGPT to draft emails to be sent to port agents. Questions that are often overlooked by busy crew managers are included, including “can you please advise on any immigration or port state restrictions, if PCR tests are required for shore leave and how much it will cost.” To prevent errors, SeaGPT does not allow hallucinations, so if the details requested aren’t available, it flags it instead of assuming of impersonating information. Emails can be sent through Greywing’s platform and flights can be booked there, too, if needed. Olickel explains that when crew managers get emails back, they often receive information in different formats. For example, it can be in a list, written out in a paragraph or even in different languages. SeaGPT helps by translating (languages it can handle include Hindi, Greek, Russian and Mandarin), pulling out per-person costs and historical costs and putting it into a user’s Greywing records. SeaGPT is now primarily meant for communication with port agents, but Olickel said as it develops further, Greywing wants it to help simplify communication between agents, seafarers and masters into relevant points that can be imported as structured data. “In the long-term, we expect SeaGPT to be a team member or executive assistant to the crewing team, as a tool that is simply copied into communications when necessary,” he said. “It runs in the background, retrieving relevant data and handling all communications that don’t need direct involvement, and providing automated decision support for each crew manager.”"

253,To raise an opportunity fund this year or to not raise an opportunity fund?,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 8, 2023","One of the biggest venture capital trends of the last few years was early-stage firms raising “opportunity” funds to make follow-on investments into their most successful bets. But amid a tougher fundraising market that impacts both VCs and startups, muted exit environment and slowdown in late-stage funding, will that trend continue? Earlier this week, TechCrunch first reported that Lux Capital was raising money. What stood out was the firm ditching its opportunity fund and combining its early- and late-stage strategies into one vehicle that will mainly focus on early-stage deal-making. This came just weeks after Y Combinator announced it was pulling back from its late-stage strategy too. At first, I thought these were just the first few indicators that 2023 would likely be the year the opportunity fund trend dies, but of course, it’s not that simple. I think whether to raise an opportunity fund will become a much more debated question for firms looking to raise money this year. I think we will see significantly less of them, but there will still be firms raising them with good reason. Khosla Ventures and Canaan appear to be among these: Back in January, Khosla started fundraising for a slate of new funds, including an opportunity fund, and on Thursday, Canaan said it had raised $850 million across two funds, its flagship early-stage fund and a late-stage strategy, my colleague Connie Lozios reported.

255,3CX blames North Korea for supply chain mass-hack,['@carlypage_'],"April 11, 2023","Enterprise phone provider 3CX has confirmed that North Korea–backed hackers were behind last month’s supply chain attack that appeared to target cryptocurrency companies. 3CX, which provides online voice, video conferencing and messaging services for businesses, worked with cybersecurity company Mandiant to investigate the attack. Hackers compromised the company’s desktop phone software used by hundreds of thousands of organizations to plant information-stealing malware inside their customers’ corporate networks. Pierre Jourdan, chief information security officer at 3CX, said on Tuesday that their investigation confirms that hackers linked to the North Korean regime were behind the attack. “Based on the Mandiant investigation into the 3CX intrusion and supply chain attack thus far, they attribute the activity to a cluster named UNC4736,” Jourdan said. “Mandiant assesses with high confidence that UNC4736 has a North Korean nexus.” Cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike last week linked the 3CX breach to hackers it calls Labyrinth Chollima, a subunit of the notorious Lazarus Group, which is known for stealthy hacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its nuclear weapons program. Russia-based Kaspersky Lab also attributed the 3CX breach to North Korea. Kaspersky said in its analysis of the attack that the hackers were seen deploying a backdoor, which it has named “Gopuram,” onto infected systems, noting that the attackers have “a specific interest in cryptocurrency companies.” Kaspersky added that Gopuram was deployed on less than ten machines, indicating that the attackers used this backdoor with “surgical precision.” In a forum post last week, 3CX CEO Nick Galea said that the company is only aware of “a handful of cases” where malware has been triggered. However, the impact of the attack, along with how 3CX was compromised, remains unknown. The company claims to have over 600,000 business customers worldwide and more than 12 million active daily users.  "
256,"Kodiak Robotics is adding an electric, autonomous semi truck to its fleet next year",['@rebeccabellan'],"May 2, 2023","Self-driving trucking company Kodiak Robotics plans to introduce an electric autonomous Class 8 truck to its fleet in 2024. The news comes as California, one of the states Kodiak hopes to do business in, recently voted to ban the sale of new diesel heavy-duty trucks by 2036 and will require that all trucks be zero emissions by 2042.  With the exception of Swedish company Einride and its electric autonomous pods, most autonomous trucking companies are still testing and deploying diesel engine trucks. That’s largely because the electric trucking industry isn’t yet well developed, as evidenced by the less than desirable ranges on the electric semis coming to market today. Kodiak’s Peterbilt Model 579EV, for example, only has a range of 150 miles, which wouldn’t cover even a one-way trip on most of the routes Kodiak drives.  Kodiak says while it believes zero-emissions vehicles have a future across America, the intended use for this vehicle is in California. California has long been a champion of greener vehicles, but the same cannot be said for the state’s willingness to embrace autonomous trucking technology.  It’s currently illegal to test or deploy heavy-duty AVs in the state, and in January, regulators introduced a bill that would require a trained human safety operator to be present any time a self-driving truck operates on public roads in California. If passed, the bill would prevent the testing of driverless trucks as they were intended to be used, and would complicate the interstate freight runs that Kodiak and others are already trialing.  The bill is still currently in the California Assembly and would need to pass in the lower house before going through a range of committees in the state Senate. Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette said the company was disappointed that the Assembly is considering the ban, but he didn’t explain how Kodiak’s strategy would shift if the bill goes through.  Regardless of California’s regulatory environment, Kodiak says the introduction of the 579EV, which will be outfitted with Kodiak’s self-driving technology and latest generation of sensors, will help the company test future electric integrations.  Today, the range and charging infrastructure for electric semis is lacking. But by working with EV technology now — mostly for short-haul and drayage deployments, rather than long-haul — Kodiak says it will be ready to deploy more quickly when the range catches up to market needs.  “We believe that the future of trucking is the combination of electric and autonomous vehicles,” said Burnette in a statement. “Given advancements in battery and fuel cell technologies, achieving zero-emissions trucking will soon be within reach. Kodiak’s work on the Peterbilt Model 579EV will help us gain valuable experience in how to build autonomous electric vehicles, and help us realize that vision. Customers have been long asking for an autonomous electric vehicle and we are delivering on that need.”  Like many other autonomous technology companies, Kodiak’s autonomous system is vehicle and powertrain-agnostic, which allows the company to integrate its tech into new truck platforms as they become available. Kodiak says it will explore other sustainable vehicle platforms, such as fuel cells, as they come to market."
257,ByteDance is making its music streaming service Resso premium-only,['@indianidle'],"May 4, 2023","Three years after first launching the music streaming app Resso in India, ByteDance is making it a paid-only service. The company notified users on the app and website saying that “Resso will upgrade to a Premium-only service from May 11, 2023, to elevate your social music streaming experience.” The service currently operates in India, Brazil and Indonesia. ByteDance’s global head of music business development, Ole Obermann said this move is to make the service better for users while increasing benefits for artists. “Resso’s move to a premium-only service will allow the development of a better user experience for music fans, while increasing opportunities for rightsholders and artists,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to building the world’s leading social music streaming platform and ensuring artists and music creators can rightly benefit from its growing success.” The company said that the subscription tier offers ad-free listening, the option to download songs for offline listening, lyrics generation for sharing and social features like duo playlists. Resso offers subscriptions at R$16.90 ($3.38) per month in Brazil, Rp 49,000 ($3.34) per month in Indonesia and ₹119 ($1.46) per month in India. In comparison, a Spotify premium subscription costs R$19.90 ($3.99) per month in Brazil, Rp 49,000 ($3.75) in Indonesia and ₹119 ($1.46) per month in India. Resso has been downloaded more than 250 million times to date, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. Senior insights analysts Abe Yousef said that 2021 was the service’s biggest year, with nearly 100 million downloads. This year, in Q12023 the ByteDance-owned app was downloaded only 13.5 million times — a 47% drop year-on-year. Resso also faced challenges in terms of maintaining the portfolio of songs on its service as Sony Music pulled its catalog last year. Yousef noted that India is the biggest market for Resso in terms of active users. However, Brazil represented 73% of paid users for the music streaming app. Last year, new trademarks in various regions and code in the Resso app suggested that ByteDance was preparing to launch TikTok Music in multiple markets. Since then, the company had removed many references to TikTok Music in the Resso app. ByteDance is facing a lot of scrutiny in the U.S. for TikTok’s data-sharing practices. On the other hand, its social app Lemon8 is gaining popularity in the country. It’s unclear what the China-based company is thinking about expanding its music streaming services. Current economical conditions also could be to blame for ByteDance’s move to make Resso a premium service. In India, Tencent-backed Gaana shut down its free tier last year in a similar move. Plus globally, big players in the industry like Spotify are struggling to make a profit. Update May 5, 2023, 1:15 PM IST: Bytedance’s earlier statement said Ole Obermann was the Global Head of Music at the company. However, his correct title is the Global Head of Music Business Development at Bytedance. The story has been updated to reflect that. "
258,SVB collapse spared an already muted venture deal market,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"March 29, 2023","When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed earlier this month, venture had already been navigating choppy waters for over a year as it confronted overinflated company valuations and a seemingly nonexistent exit market. But while SVB’s failure may have a long-lasting impact on the banking and venture debt industries, it doesn’t look likely to have any lasting adverse impact on one of venture’s hardest-hit areas: deal activity. Venture capital deal volume has been almost steadily declining since the beginning of 2022. While many investors and founders hoped for some relief in 2023, that hasn’t materialized — yet, at least. So far, January and February have continued trending down, according to Crunchbase data, with global funding in February totaling $18 billion, the lowest total since February 2020. With deal-making in such a vulnerable state, it seemed like any market trigger could have an impact, but lawyers and VC firms told TechCrunch+ that the demise of SVB doesn’t look like it will make things any worse. It seems that any pause the news did create for investors and founders has likely already passed. "
259,A claw machine does not a robotic gripper make,['@bheater'],"April 28, 2023","A refrain I hear from a lot of startups is that there’s “no need to rethink the gripper.” It’s something I appreciate from an economic standpoint. It’s expensive, resource intensive and both your time and money are probably best spent elsewhere when there are already so many effectors on the market. I also recently made an analogy to a claw machine during an interview — and got some pushback. I understand a bit better now why that’s the case — at least in part. Discussing its new approach to robotic gripping, MIT invokes the perennial arcade favorite, noting, “When manipulating an arcade claw, a player can plan all she wants. But once she presses the joystick button, it’s a game of wait-and-see. If the claw misses its target, she’ll have to start from scratch for another chance at a prize.” Image Credits: MIT Image Credits: MIT If you think about that for a moment, you realize that you’re suddenly faced with something that comes up over and over again in this field of study: That’s not how humans approach the job — and there’s a reason for that. If you’re say, grabbing an object with a strange or unexpected weight distribution, you generally don’t need to withdraw your hand and try again. You adjust. The team describes a system that adjusts to an object in real time, using reflexes and feedback. Says MIT: If the gripper fails to grab hold of the object, rather than back out and start again as most grippers do, the team wrote an algorithm that instructs the robot to quickly act out any of three grasp maneuvers, which they call “reflexes,” in response to real-time measurements at the fingertips. The three reflexes kick in within the last centimeter of the robot approaching an object and enable the fingers to grab, pinch, or drag an object until it has a better hold. Interestingly, the project builds on actuators developed for the school’s mini cheetah robot, which were designed to help it react to uneven terrain on the fly. The new system is built around an arm with two multi-joint fingers. There’s a camera on the base and sensors on the tips that record feedback. The system uses that data to adjust accordingly. Currently the team is using the gripper to clean up around the lab. Says MIT: They set a variety of household objects on a shelf, including a bowl, a cup, a can, an apple, and a bag of coffee grounds. They showed that the robot was able to quickly adapt its grasp to each object’s particular shape and, in the case of the coffee grounds, squishiness. Out of 117 attempts, the gripper quickly and successfully picked and placed objects more than 90 percent of the time, without having to back out and start over after a failed grasp."
260,CommScope employees left in the dark after ransomware attack,"['Zack Whittaker', 'Carly Page']","April 27, 2023","CommScope employees say they haven’t heard from executives in over a week about how the company is responding to a ransomware attack, which allowed hackers to steal reams of corporate and employee data from its systems. The technology giant, which designs and builds network infrastructure products for companies, hospitals, schools and federal networks, recently admitted it was hit by a ransomware attack on March 27 after some of the company’s stolen files subsequently appeared online. A ransomware gang known as Vice Society claimed responsibility for the attack by posting the company’s stolen data to its dark web leak site, which it uses to extort victims by threatening to publish internal files if a ransom demand isn’t paid. The stolen data contains troves of internal documents, technical drawings, internal corporate databases, invoices and corporate spending. Some of the data also includes employees’ personal information. Several CommScope employees told TechCrunch that their last communication from executives about the cyberattack was on April 18, saying the company was “continuing to work expeditiously to review and validate the data asserted to have been posted on the dark web.” “We believe any employee data involved in this incident would have been inadvertently stored outside our cloud-based human resources information systems,” CommScope general counsel Justin Choi told employees in an email. An email sent to employees a day earlier said the company said it does “not have evidence” to suggest employee data was involved. TechCrunch has seen files containing personal data of thousands of people who are, or once were, employed by CommScope. The files include home addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account information. Some of the files are dated, given they were authored by an employee who no longer works at CommScope. Another file contains a list of thousands of former employees, their names, addresses and Social Security numbers. More recent data includes a folder containing scans of some employee’s unexpired passports and immigration visas, including one belonging to a child. When reached for comment, CommScope declined to say how many people it has notified about the breach so far. “CommScope continues to work expeditiously on its investigation to review the affected data. We’re moving as quickly as possible, however, these types of data reviews take time and we want to be accurate and complete in our notifications to affected individuals. We continue to maintain direct communication with our employees, as appropriate, as we have throughout the entirety of this incident,” said Cheryl Przychodni, a spokesperson for CommScope. Employees tell TechCrunch that the ransomware attack caused several days of widespread disruption across the company, including plant production, where the company builds some of its products. One employee said they saw a ransom note on their work computer, which read: “All of your files have been encrypted by Vice Society.” The ransom note includes links to Vice Society’s dark web leak site containing the company’s stolen files, and several email addresses used by the gang for negotiating a ransom with victims. When reached by email, the hacker group told TechCrunch: “Where did you get this mail?” It’s not clear if CommScope paid a ransom."
261,"TechCrunch+ roundup: Deep tech tips for SaaS VCs, toxic fundraising, student visa startup options",[],"April 21, 2023","If someone said “startup” while we were playing a word association game, I’d respond with “fundraising.” (I bet you would, too.) Asking people for money is a key aspect of every founder’s journey, but Techstars Managing Director Collin Wallace says it can also “accelerate your demise.” For example, raising a round to rev up engineering, sales and marketing sounds positive — but what if the business itself has negative unit economics?

Product problems? Process problems? People problems? Is my business model fundamentally flawed?” In this article, he examines four scenarios that often lead entrepreneurs to seek out new cash and explains why getting “a clear picture of what is fueling losses” is much more important.

A SaaS mindset just isn’t relevant for deep tech investment, which means traditional VCs must recalibrate their behavior (and expectations) before diving in. “Software investors’ founder-first mantra is simply wrong in the world of deep tech,” writes Suthipongchai. “This type of magical thinking is exactly why their software playbook is doomed to fail.”   Image Credits: Getty Images Image Credits: Getty Images Tech investors don’t tend to back physical businesses because they have so many literal moving parts: SaaS startups can’t get a flat tire or fail a health inspection, and they certainly don’t need foot traffic. “But Blank Street claims to have cracked the code on how to make a chain of more than 65 physical coffee shops have the right metrics to attract venture capitalists,” writes Rebecca Szkutak. “They recently closed on a $20 million Series B round amid a year where fundraising has taken a nosedive — even for companies with low overhead costs.”   Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Dear Sophie, I just found out that I’ve been accepted to an American university, which was my first choice!

262,Oxfam Novib and Goodwell target East African startups with €20M Pepea fund,['@annienjanja'],"March 30, 2023","Impact investor Goodwell Investments and Oxfam Novib, a Dutch foundation and Oxfam International affiliate, have set up Pepea, a €20 million ($21.7 million) fund, to provide financing to early-stage startups in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. The fund, created with the backing of Oxfam Novib Impact Investments, will provide venture debt with a focus on mezzanine finance, which is a debt that can be turned into equity. Pepea will target early-stage businesses that have been in existence for one to five years, and are generating revenues but yet to raise capital. Goodwell Investments, which will manage the fund’s operations, and help develop its portfolio, told TechCrunch that part of the support to startups will include ensuring that they have the right “structures and systems” in place, to help them prepare and raise their first rounds. The fund will invest in businesses in sustainable agriculture, energy, clean mobility, logistics and waste management sectors, which produce basic goods and services that represent a huge proportion of household spending for lower-income communities. Pepea’s long-term plan is to improve the quality and affordability of these necessities. The fund targets high-impact tech-enabled businesses, “because the combination of tech and brick-and-mortar works best in these environments. Tech enables access and affordability, and both are elementary for the end-users we aim to reach, the lower income groups on the continent,” said Goodwell Investments managing partner Els Boerhof.   The fund will finance startups in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, markets where Oxfam and Goodwell have a presence. Development organization Oxfam runs an SME incubation program in the three markets, while Goodwell’s funds are active in both Uganda and Kenya. Pepea, the first fund by the impact investor and the non-government organization, will provide an initial check of between $100,000 and $500,000, and follow-on investments of up to $1 million, from Goodwell’s funds. Goodwell launched its first fund in 2007, and has provided equity funding to over 20 businesses, including Paga, MFS Africa, Sendy, Max.ng and Good Nature Agro. While it mainly targets startups in finance, agriculture and mobility, last year, it led a $50 million Series C round for e-commerce scaleup Copia Global. The impact investor launched its second fund last year, the $154 million UMunthu II, and currently has over €310 million under management. On the other hand, Oxfam Novib launched its first investment fund in 1996, and has since 2015 provided SMEs with access to finance through its Impact SME Development (iSME) program. It plans to further this with the Pepea fund, through which it hopes to help businesses maximize their positive impact within the communities they serve. “Oxfam Novib played a sterling role in developing the microfinance sector as a means to provide access to financial services where they were most needed. As that sector has matured beyond the realm of NGOs, we are ready to change direction towards a less-served segment of the market,”said Oxfam Novib, investment manager, Tamara Campero. “We acknowledge the challenges of SMEs in the region (especially those that are women-owned) to access fine-tuned patient capital and we now want to play a role to address those needs,” said Campero."
263,How to pitch me: 5 investors discuss what they’re looking for in April 2023,[],"April 25, 2023","After attending TechCrunch Early Stage last week, I was cheered to meet so many first-time founders and experienced investors who are looking for opportunities. Based on my conversations, VCs are very open to working with novices who can show that they understand the market in which they hope to compete. But deal-making is idiosyncratic: A few investors might be content to make a deal over coffee, but early-stage teams still need a sturdy pitch deck or memo they can leave behind. Similarly, one VC may encourage newly minted CEOs to eat ramen and ride the bus, while another might suggest a salary in the low six figures, depending on geography. I’m going to save you some time: Many (if not most) of you are not yet ready to pitch an investor.

I asked five early-stage investors to share frank advice for first-timers, and I’m going to save you some time: Many (if not most) of you are probably not ready to pitch an investor. If you haven’t already spoken to scores of customers or created a contact spreadsheet with at least 25 investors who’ve backed companies like yours, it’s too soon. And if you’ve added “AI” to your pitch deck only to make it more appealing, here’s some more bad news: FOMO is passé, and due diligence is the new black. In keeping with our format, these VCs explain what kinds of deals they’re looking for, how they prefer to be approached, along with some straight talk about bull-market fundraising techniques that no longer apply today. Their answers were edited for length and clarity. Thanks very much to everyone who took the time to respond! If you’re an early-stage investor who’d like to be included in future columns, email guestcolumns@techcrunch.com with “How to pitch me” in the subject line. Here’s who participated this month: What kind of opportunities are you looking for in April 2023? This year has seen massive attention paid to AI, specifically generative AI. Still, the fact of the matter is the current attention only covers a fraction of the full breadth of the opportunity. AI is far broader than the buzz would even imply! We invest in startups leveraging the immense breadth of AI to solve critical business problems. Specifically, we are spending time developing our theses around and seeking founders building the next generation of cloud/computing infrastructure, industry 4.0 and intelligent verticals, the augmentation and automation of software development, and applications and infrastructure around generative AI. Many workers who’ve been laid off recently are thinking about starting up their own companies. What’s one important thing they should know before pitching investors for the first time? We look for founders to demonstrate how to apply the right techniques, with the right data, to the right problem. Just saying your product is AI-driven will not cut it. You can expect that we will go deep into understanding your technical approach and product differentiation. From a general perspective, in your initial meeting with an investor, you must communicate why the problem you are tackling needs to be solved and why you are the right person/people to solve it. A compelling way to do so is via the business’ origin story. This should include how you identified the problem, the value of a solution and why your team is uniquely positioned to solve it. Additionally, upon raising early-stage capital, your first job will be to hire top-notch employees. Your ability to “sell” a compelling opportunity to join your business is a vital founder characteristic. How do you prefer to be approached with an initial pitch: a cold email, a warm intro or another method? A warm intro, particularly through a founder or colleague, is almost always the best way to connect with an investor. If you cannot find a warm introduction to an investor who is proactively seeking to fund outstanding entrepreneurs, how are you going to win customers who are inundated with vendors seeking their business? That said, I review everything in my inbox and can be reached at rudina@glasswing.vc. Also, remember to be intentional in your outreach, as it will save us both time in identifying if there is a potential fit. How much salary should the CEO of a pre-revenue startup take? Would you back a founder who has a second job? It is difficult to quote a specific number for salary, as that is a combination of the level of financing the company has raised, the experience of the CEO and their financial obligations. Most importantly, the compensation of a startup CEO should be a holistic conversation between the board (often your lead investor acting in their capacity as a board director) and the CEO. Trust, respect and transparency must exist such that the conversation can happen. The wrong approach to compensation is to name a specific number without context. Being a founder is an intense job; it’s all-consuming and often equates to having 1.5 to 2 jobs, so the notion that you can do it part time is just not realistic. We expect a founder to be full time on what they are building at the time of investment. But, of course, part of my job as a board director and investor is making it feasible, as it is essential for maximizing the business’ success. Building a company is a full-time (and then some) pursuit. What’s one traditional fundraising tactic founders should remove from their toolkit — something that no longer works but is still a common practice? I still frequently receive inbound requests from founders who are either out of strategy for my firm or who do not effectively communicate the opportunity to work together convincingly. There are more venture funds than ever and increasingly more specialized funds. Before reaching out to a prospective investor, diligence is critical because today, more than ever, there is likely a firm that is an excellent fit for what you are building. Notably, this goes both ways. When we reach out to a founder of potential interest, we hold ourselves to the bar of being thoughtful, prepared and able to articulate to a founder why we believe there is a potentially valuable opportunity for us to work together. Are pitch decks still necessary? Have you ever signed a term sheet without reviewing a deck first? Even at the first-capital-in stage at which we invest, where a company is pre-revenue and often pre-product, a pitch deck is valuable in guiding the conversation and serving as reference material in the diligence process. In addition, building and iterating on an effective fundraising deck can serve as a framework for thinking and addressing important questions in the early days of a business. With that in mind, I have never issued a term sheet without a presentation of some form outside of an incubation. As incubating investors, this is part of the company formation and ideation phase of the business. Many of the questions that are part of creating a fundraising deck are developed and addressed alongside a founder. Tell us about the best pitch you’ve received recently: At what point did you realize you were going to invest? One pitch that comes to mind is my first meeting with Thouheed Gaffoor, co-founder and CEO of Basetwo. In meeting Thouheed and each member of his founding team, what stood out was the high level of credibility and domain expertise. As part of our diligence process for every investment, we speak to dozens and dozens of end customers regarding the potential of investment, both users and budget owners. We knew we wanted to invest in Basetwo when, in the case of those prospective customers, they started asking us when they could get their hands on the platform. Please share one piece of advice that can help a first-time founder stand out from the rest. Do not be afraid to say “I do not know” when asked a question by an investor. In the early days of building a business, there are, by its nature, questions for which the answer is unknown. Part of business building is answering those questions. One of my favorite answers to receive is, “I do not know, but I am going to find out by…”. If you provide a thoughtful answer for how you will answer an unknown, and that unknown is stage appropriate, a good investor will not fault you and should appreciate and value your response. What are you reading/watching/listening to right now? I am currently rereading the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. It frequently reads as a timely commentary on the challenges of the day despite being published in the 1950s. One of the series’ key themes is social change, specifically how it is predicted and controlled and the role of technology. Asimov raises important questions about social and political upheaval that are equally applicable today in the real world as in the fictional world. What kind of opportunities are you looking for in April 2023? We are actively looking to lead new enterprise software investments, at both inception and Series A stages. Some areas we are excited about include artificial intelligence, data, dev tools, security [and] fintech, among other areas. Also, we invest across all parts of the enterprise stack, including applications, middleware and infrastructure companies. Many workers who’ve been laid off recently are thinking about starting up their own companies. What’s one important thing they should know before pitching investors for the first time? Before pitching investors, founders should talk to customers — not just a handful but tens or hundreds of customers. This will provide all the context, clarity and conviction required to speak to investors. How do you prefer to be approached with an initial pitch: a cold email, a warm intro or another method? As a former enterprise software CEO-turned-VC, I have a tremendous amount of respect for well-executed cold email outreach and welcome it. That being said, in Sales 101, what converts even higher than cold outreach is a warm intro, so that always is a better route (but not required)!"

265,Apple wins appeal over UK mobile market competition probe,['@riptari'],"April 3, 2023","Good news for Apple in the UK, where a competition appeals court on Friday quashed a decision by the antitrust regulator to open an investigation of the iPhone makers’ mobile browser and cloud gaming service. The Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) ruled the regulator failed to stick to established statutory timeframes for such investigations — basically, it was too late in deciding to open the probe — with Apple’s appeal succeeding on this point of law. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced a formal investigation — aka a Market Investigation Reference (MIR) — last fall, which was focused on both Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android mobile platform. The MIR decision followed a market study of the mobile duopoly that the CMA kicked off in June 2021 and resulted in a preliminary finding of competition concerns in December 2021. However, at that time, the regulator decided against taking any action, apparently anticipating new powers to tackle Big Tech as a result of a “pro-competition” reboot the government had suggested it would implement, back in fall 2020, following a 2019 competition policy review. The problem for the CMA is the UK government failed to stick to this plan. And, in May 2022, under then-prime minister Boris Johnson, it kicked the competition reboot into the long grass, leaving the CMA’s Digital Markets Unit dangling without the expected new powers. That also, of course, left its earlier decision to hang fire on taking action over mobile market concerns in anticipation of bespoke competition powers high and dry. In June 2022, the CMA pressed on to publish a final report of what was then a year-long mobile ecosystem study cementing its view that there are substantial concerns about the market power of Apple and Google which require regulatory intervention. And in November it announced an in-depth investigation of elements of particular concern — including Apple’s mobile browser and cloud gaming — apparently seeking to make the best of a bad situation. However, by then it was too late, and, per the Tribunal, the CMA likely erred in law by attempting to re-visit an earlier decision not to make a reference. “The CMA did not have the option to decide not to make a reference at all with a reservation entitling it to re-visit that decision at its discretion at a later date,” the Tribunal writes in a 42-page judgement on where it saw the regulator’s decision-making go wrong. “The choice made by the CMA — to make a final decision not to refer — is, as we have said, questionable on public law grounds.” Commenting in a statement, a CMA spokesperson suggested it may seek to appeal, writing: We are disappointed with today’s judgment. We made this market investigation reference to make sure that UK consumers get a better choice of mobile internet services and that UK developers can invest in innovative new apps. Our concerns, and the reasons why we launched our market investigation, were not challenged by Apple. Today’s judgment has found there are material constraints on the CMA’s general ability to refer markets for in-depth investigations. This risks substantially undermining the CMA’s ability to efficiently and effectively investigate and intervene in markets where competition is not working well. Given the importance of today’s judgment, we will be considering our options including seeking permission to appeal. Update: An Apple spokesperson said: The saga underlines how political chaos in the UK has not only undermined new policymaking in the digital arena but continues to have knock-on implications for the enforcement of existing laws that might otherwise have been applied, years earlier, to curb the market power of tech giants if regulators had clear guidance and commitment from lawmakers to take action. Instead critical oversight bodies like the CMA have been left flapping in the wind atop a political quagmire and the tech giants have enjoyed much steadier sailing. Seems a direct result of this government’s choice to delay the Digital Market Unit legislation, as CMA only delayed investigation in expectation of new powers. Regulators’ paralysis, of the sort this gov pushes, means even the decisions they want to make are procedurally fragile. https://t.co/1MhDDiiW5b — Michael Veale @mikarv@someone.elses.computer (@mikarv) April 3, 2023   "
266,Why startups should care about geopolitical repercussions of US climate law,['@tdechant'],"March 29, 2023","Pity Donald Trump. He spent four years in office tearing up trade agreements and ranting about rewriting old ones, all to little avail. Now, a key U.S. climate law is doing more to change the dynamics of international trade than any blustering and bullying ever did. The Inflation Reduction Act has been hailed as a win for domestic producers of minerals that are critical to electric vehicles and other hallmarks of the decarbonized economy. The most impactful so far have been the provisions that require a minimum amount of domestic sourcing and processing to be eligible for the $7,500 EV tax credit. That language alone has spurred tens of billions of dollars of investment in the U.S. battery supply chain. But there’s no way the U.S. can produce all that’s needed — the country simply doesn’t have enough reserves, while China has a lock on many parts of the market. So the law also includes a handy loophole qualifying minerals from countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement. The law already qualified “North American” suppliers, and the free trade language opens the door further. Late on Monday, the door opened a little wider as the U.S. and Japan announced a trade deal encompassing cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese and nickel, all minerals that are key components of EV batteries. The agreement opens up both markets to new supplies of the minerals, allowing battery manufacturers and automakers to benefit from the IRA’s minerals requirement. For now, Japan is the only country to successfully negotiate a new agreement in the wake of the IRA, but it probably won’t be the only one. The EU, which has made no secret about its displeasure with the new law, is also in talks with the U.S. In the seven months or so since the IRA was passed, the global landscape for critical minerals and battery manufacturing has changed rapidly, and a potentially steady stream of new free trade agreements promises to keep things fluid. For founders and investors alike, that injects a fresh dose of uncertainty. "
267,VCs continue to pour dollars into generative AI,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 28, 2023","The appetite for generative AI — AI that turns text prompts into images, essays, poems, videos and more — is insatiable. And the investment dollars keep flowing, not shockingly. According to a PitchBook report released this month, VCs have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Angel and seed deals have grown, as well, with 107 deals and $358.3 million invested in 2022 compared with just 41 and $102.8 million in 2018. Crunchbase broke down some of the biggest winners in an early February dispatch. In the video category, WSC Sports, which uses AI to generate personally tailored video clips for sports fans, landed $100 million in Series D funding nearly a year ago. In the writing space, Jasper, developer of a platform that helps create and vet original marketing content, raised $125 million in an October round led by Insight Partners, valuing it at over $1 billion. The surge in interest from early-stage VC companies alone is staggering, with a total of $2.2 billion raised in 2022. Language model developer Anthropic has secured a whopping $1.3 billion in VC funding. OpenAI has raised over $1 billion. Cohere, Inflection and Stability AI have all raised over $100 million, which are all very respectable sums. So why the massive influx of cash? First, the declining cost of training cutting-edge machine learning tech and advances in research have propelled both in-house teams and startups alike. Models like the open source text-generating GPT-Neo and text-to-image Stable Diffusion made it possible for ventures large and small to jump on the generative AI train, while open efforts such as EleutherAI, which developed GPT-Neo, have made available models that previously would’ve been gatekept by large commercial labs (e.g., DeepMind). Another factor driving the generative AI investment is the increased interest from public cloud providers. Recognizing the revenue opportunity, providers are making significant acquisitions and striking generous partnerships to get ahead of the rest of the crowd."
268,That was fast! Microsoft slips ads into AI-powered Bing Chat,['@techcrunch'],"March 29, 2023","Microsoft is “exploring” putting ads in the responses given by Bing Chat, its new search agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4. While these sponsored responses are clearly labeled as such, it does make one question how far we’ve really come from the old model of ads on search engines. Microsoft confirmed this is happening, albeit in an experimental form, in a blog post published today. Here’s the relevant bit from the very end after “a bit of context” explaining no one should be surprised: We are also exploring additional capabilities for publishers including our more than 7,500 Microsoft Start partner brands. We recently met with some of our partners to begin exploring ideas and to get feedback on how we can continue to distribute content in a way that is meaningful in traffic and revenue for our partners. As we look to continue to evolve the model together, we shared some early ideas we’re exploring including:
• An expanded hover experience where hovering over a link from a publisher will display more links from that publisher giving the user more ways to engage and driving more traffic to the publisher’s website.
• For our Microsoft Start partners, placing a rich caption of Microsoft Start licensed content beside the chat answer helping to drive more user engagement with the content on Microsoft Start where we share the ad revenue with the partner. We’re also exploring placing ads in the chat experience to share the ad revenue with partners whose content contributed to the chat response. Ads have been reported anecdotally for a couple weeks, but a tweet today by Glean’s Debarghya Das captured them in the wild: Bing Chat now has Ads! It's going to be fascinating to see how the unit economics of Ads in language models will unfold and affect search advertising. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/o5YjRjikOP — Deedy (@debarghya_das) March 29, 2023  Others pointed out that the ads have been there since launch but not enabled for all users. I tried my best to summon one but to no avail — they don’t seem to be enabled for my account (yet). But clearly this is a sign of things to come. Let us admit that search engines, and now these search agents, are part of a business model and as such need some kind of monetization. But I think that with all the talk about revolutionizing search and starting fresh, we all rather expected something a little better than sponsored answers. In the case of the ad above, it’s not clear to the user what’s sponsored here. Is TrueCar selling this car and paying for placement on searches for new Hondas? Or are they just a reference or price checking site that pays to be the preferred provider of car prices to Bing? Why are these prices higher than the ones listed at Honda? Is Microsoft being paid to not include Autotrader or Cars.com listings? Can the user ask for non-sponsored results? It’s not to say that there is anything nefarious going on. But generally speaking the user should understand what is being advertised. We have learned how to parse search results: ads usually have a little box around them and are at the top of the pile. You don’t have to like it to understand it — and by understanding it you can more intelligently engage (or disengage) with them.   In a case like this, I would love to have a better “meta-conversation,” if you will, a little thought bubble to the side of the chat that has its citations and, if they exist, its ads. The answer itself should not be tampered with — but over in the metacon you have a few links and perhaps a “If you’re thinking of buying a new HR-V, 3 were listed in the last day at TrueCar. (Ad)” The more dire side effect of this is that ads like this can’t be blocked with current tools. That’s not to say they can’t be blocked at all — it’s not hard to imagine a uBlock Origin that replaces chatbot responses flagged as ads and requests another response. But the paradigm of ads as essentially predictable items in labeled locations is clearly ending. On one hand, well… good! Everyone hates ads, even though they’re kind of how the web (including, admittedly, this website) pays for itself. On the other, it’s a new and potentially more subtle and subversive form of advertising that may not be as easily delineated and ignored. Making the user wonder whether the chatbot was paid to say what it said is a great way to slow or erode trust, even with “ad” labels. One can’t help but wonder how honest these companies are being about their deals. Why shouldn’t they have a premium ad tier that influences results but doesn’t get labeled? It’s completely in line with ad industry shenanigans. While no one expects Microsoft, or Google, Amazon, Meta and all the others to operate these expensive and computation-hungry language models out of the goodness of their hearts (assuming they have hearts and there is good in them), it would be nice to see a little more thought put into how advertising can better be integrated. When the whole model is changing, the obvious solution — that happens to be a lot like one you used in the old times — is unlikely to be the best. And going with it exposes the company’s priorities in a way that may lead to distrust and skepticism.  "
269,Google might announce a foldable Pixel next month,['@bheater'],"April 18, 2023","Consumer hardware isn’t always a foregone conclusion for I/O. In fact, after the last few pandemic events, nothing much feels like a foregone conclusion these days. After what felt like a universally off year for consumer electronics, however, we’ve got big hopes for developer shows like I/O and WWDC. Google’s budget Pixel 7a has looked like a slam dunk for some time now, while the long-threatened Pixel Tablet seemed a distinct possibility (at the very least some stage time, if not a full launch). In recent weeks and months a foldable phone has begun to look increasingly likely. Some important background here. First, Google announced foldable screen support for Android back in 2018. Obviously, Samsung was both the big partner and recipient in those days, and Google wanted to make Android development as frictionless as possible for other OEMs in exploring the form factor. The following year, Google foldable patents surfaced. Now, we’re all adults here, who implicitly understand that patents don’t mean a company is working on a product. That said, it’s another key data point in this story. In the intervening years, foldables have begun gathering steam, even outside of the Samsung orbit. I was genuinely amazed by how many different models there were populating the halls of MWC back in March. Google, of course, went through its own hardware transformation a couple of years back. After years of struggling and a few identity crises, the company got serious about building a flagship with the Pixel 6, right down to its in-house silicon. The Pixel saw significant market share growth, but remains a single-digit drop in the bucket of the overall North American smartphone market. A new spate of rumors show a book-style foldable that’s rumored to be on the I/O schedule roughly three weeks from now. The form factor has been compared to Oppo’s recent foldable, in contrast with the narrower Samsung Fold variety. It also evokes Microsoft’s erstwhile Duo — though that system opted for a split rather than foldable screen. Rumor on the street is that Google is considering the “Pixel Notepad” name. Maybe it’s just the years of Galaxy Notes, but that screams “stylus” to me. Another rumor puts the price around $1,400 — pricey by any reasonable measure, but smack in the middle of the Galaxy Flip ($999) and Fold ($1,800). Other rumors put the price much closer to the Galaxy Fold’s."

271,Climate tech VC firm closes $300M fund after LPs push for broader investment opportunities,['@tdechant'],"April 19, 2023","Climate tech may have started the year with a down quarter, but don’t count it out just yet. Amid a backdrop of depressing figures from much of the venture capital sector, climate tech deals were lower both in value and in deal count. But it remains to be seen whether it’s the start of a longer trend or just a brief blip. As if to argue in favor of the latter, Congruent Ventures on Wednesday announced the close of a new $300 million fund that, like its other funds, will focus on climate tech. The sheer size suggests that not only is the specialist VC firm confident in the sector’s future, but that its limited partners are, too. Unlike its previous funds, which are aimed at the seed and Series A stages, the new Continuity Fund will focus on providing follow-on financing for its portfolio companies, which include AMP Robotics, Servo Energy, Span.IO, Avalanche Energy and others. Still, the firm says it won’t be straying far. “We don’t actually see this as a move away from the early stage; that is still always where we’re going to be forming our relationships,” managing partner Abe Yokell told TechCrunch+. But after executing a couple special-purpose vehicles to provide additional financing for earlier investments, there was appetite for more."
272,Quantexa raises $129M at a $1.8B valuation to help navigate online fraud and customer data management,['@ingridlunden'],"April 3, 2023","Financial fraud and other online crime continue to present major threats to businesses, and they remain a key focus for regulators requiring more rigorous efforts to keep illicit activity at bay. Now, London-based Quantexa — one of the big startups providing AI and other tools to major banks and others in financial services, governments and other major organizations to tackle these challenges — is announcing $129 million in funding, a round that underscores how services like these are being viewed in the market today, and Quantexa’s specific traction within it. The funding is coming in the form of a Series E that values the startup at $1.8 billion. For some context, this is a major step up from its previous round nearly two years ago (in July 2021), a Series D of $153 million that was raised at an $800 million – $900 million valuation. (It’s also a higher number than some thought the round would be: last week a report of Quantexa raising estimated that it would be “close to $1.5 billion”.)  Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC — which was also a major investor in Stripe’s recent $6.5 billion round — led this round, with participation from previous backers Warburg Pincus, Dawn Capital, British Patient Capital, Evolution Equity Partners, HSBC, BNY Mellon, ABN AMRO and AlbionVC. Prior to this round, Quantexa had raised $240 million. The last six months have been such a tricky time for a lot of startups looking to raise money, but Quantexa is one of the small group that has bucked that trend. CEO and founder Vishal Marria said in an interview that the round was oversubscribed and is coming at a time when the startup still has “between two and three years of runway” from previous rounds and cash it’s generating from its business. Part of the reason for the strong interest from investors is because of how the company has been doing. The company’s core products are in the area of risk and compliance — for example tools to help verify user identities, detect money laundering and to carry out financial investigations. Alongside that Quantexa is using some of the same techniques to build out bigger user “graphs” for business intelligence and CRM purposes. Together these are used by hundreds of customers in some 70 countries, the company said, including major enterprise organizations like BNY Mellon, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Danske Bank, Vodafone and the Public Sector Fraud Authority within the U.K.’s Cabinet Office. Marria said that Quantexa has doubled its business in the last 18 months: “We’ve doubled the number of users, the revenues and the number of industries we target,” he said. Interestingly, Quantexa’s fundraise comes in on the same day that another KYC startup, Fourthline, also announced a big round of $54 million. Fourthline’s approach up to now (and going forward) has been to build everything it uses from the ground up. Quantexa is taking a different view: it builds but also leans heavily on APIs to work with whatever its customers might already have integrated into their platforms and operations. What the two have in common is a fundamental view of how to use AI tools in tackling the issues of fraud, identity management and compliance: The techniques used by bad actors are sophisticated and too numerous for humans on their own to track, so machine learning, natural language, computer vision and other AI technology can be built to help in that task. Quantexa’s plan is to double down on that strategy: The plan will be to use the fresh funding, plus the money that the company already had in its coffers, to invest in building out new technology, but also to make acquisitions to grow inorganically. Given the number of interesting enterprise and big data startups that have emerged over the last several years, and the number that have found it hard to raise money and scale, there are a number of interesting targets. Marria noted that a recent acquisition, of the Irish startup Aylien, points to the kinds of acquisitions Quantexa might make: Aylien’s specialty was natural language processing (NLP) and advanced AI and working with unstructured data, he said. Notably, Quantexa is not yet profitable, but Marria said investors are willing to be patient because the startup’s been hitting so many of its other targets. “That gives the community confidence that our plan is accurate and we can deliver on it.” The company is growing ARR at 140% (at Series D subscriptions revenues were 108%), and he projects that the company will make $100 million in revenues next year, turning profitable by 2025."
273,I actually had fun at Fatboy Slim’s metaverse rave,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 25, 2023","I stood outside a 50s truck stop diner and gas station under a dark, dusky sky. A bright neon sign that said Norm’s Drive In illuminated the space. Behind a psychedelic school bus parked in the dirt lot, monstrous limbs with huge eyeballs, long lashes and smiley faces for irises extended upwards. Little aliens ran around me, and I fell into a swirling vortex that made me want to vomit. Familiar dance electronic beats played in my ears.  From there I was taken through a series of even more outlandish settings. A Mad Max-style parade of cars, a dance floor inside a human skull, a nauseating roller coaster ride, a table back at the diner where I was tiny and rode cockroaches around glasses of milkshake. Then I was skydiving in the clouds while gold-clad dancers did acrobatics before landing in a desert where a digital replica of iconic British DJ Fatboy Slim did his set in front of a tripped-up version of Mount Rushmore. Instead of the founding fathers, the carved faces were Che Guevara, Greta Thunberg, Camille Yarbrough and Grandmaster Flash.  This was not a dream. It was a 45-minute Fatboy Slim concert in virtual reality. Only during this concert, there would be no digital replicas of venues, no feeling of togetherness with the crowd and, certainly, for me alone in my bedroom on a Thursday morning in New Zealand, no dancing.  “We don’t want to be hung up on reality,” Norman Cook, AKA Fatboy Slim, told me after the concert. “The whole point of the metaverse is that things can happen there that can’t happen in real life. So we took that idea and said we’d make it a fantasy gig where you would go in your dreams.” This fantasy gig was created and hosted by Irish metaverse startup Engage. When the company first invited me to join this concert, I was skeptical to the point of eye rolling, but still curious. Was this just a marketing ploy for Fatboy Slim, who was on tour at the time? How much of a hand would Cook actually have in the ideation of this event? Why does Engage, a company that describes itself as a “business-focused metaverse platform” want to throw a virtual rave? Turns out Cook was indeed involved in and passionate about the project (more on that later). It was also definitely a marketing ploy, but not so much for the DJ — rather, for Engage.  “We built a platform for enterprise and education, and the majority of our user base are the same age as me,” said Dave Whelan, 42, CEO and co-founder of Engage. “We wanted to host a concert to get people interested in the platform and show off its capabilities, but also to attract the right type of client to the platform. We don’t want a lot of 12- and 14-year-old kids. We want professionals, and Fatboy Slim would have been one of those artists that they’d have grown up with.”        Part of Engage’s strategy to show off its capabilities was to create the antithesis of an analog concert, something unconstrained by the laws of nature or physics, or even the laws of gigs. A real-life gig performed live in one venue. This one had a recording of Fatboy Slim present at every strange scene, and it intentionally moved from place to place that leaned into the intangible. “It doesn’t necessarily have a linear narrative or actually mean anything,” said Cook. “It could be a dream. It could be an acid trip.” Whelan agreed that getting kooky is the whole point of the metaverse.  “If you try to replicate the real world, you’re always going to lose. The real world is fantastic,” Whelan told TechCrunch. “Give people experiences they can’t get anywhere else. So that’s why the concert started off kind of like a concert, and then it just progressively got crazier and crazier.” The Kia dealership in the metaverse is part of the Kia Sportage campaign.

Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage Today, the Engage app is used by a range of corporate and education clients, from KPMG and Kia to Stanford and Oxford Universities. The work Engage does with Kia is how I originally connected with the company. They showed me around a Kia dealership in the metaverse, which was built as part of the Kia Sportage campaign. Whelan said companies like KPMG have been using Engage to see how it feels replacing Zoom meetings and in-person offsites with virtual boardrooms and immersive experiences. They’re also meeting up in Engage to network and talk about the metaverse, something that Whelan hopes to foster so that Engage can become “the LinkedIn of the metaverse.”  Universities are using Engage both to learn more about VR and the metaverse, and to access immersive courses. For example, I sat in on an Oxford University lecture set in a replica of the university’s Bodleian Library about Venus that included hovering models of planets rotating in a virtual library.  It all sounds very exciting, but like any metaverse-related concept, Engage might be putting the cart before the horse. The company is building out worlds and content, taking a bet that professionals, for example, will actually want to buy a headset and wear it for metaverse hangs and virtual networking events. One could look to Zoom as an example of the world getting comfortable engaging in a digital space, but Zoom didn’t have the same friction as Engage and other VR apps. In other words, Zoom is downloaded to an existing laptop or PC — it doesn’t require you to invest in a whole new piece of hardware.  “Exploring Venus” lecture with Professor Colin Wilson at a digital replica of the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Library.

Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage Sales of VR headsets in the U.S. actually declined 2% year-over-year in 2022, according to data from NPD Group, and that is already coming from a lean starting place. This year is expected to be another slow one in the VR market due to a weak economy and inflation, which means people won’t want to spend money on non-essential purchases like VR headsets. And in this stage of capitalism where only constant growth makes a product successful, stagnation and decline are death knells. Numerous false starts from companies like Google and Samsung have also soured many early adopters. Meta’s Oculus Pro, which is wireless and geared toward professionals, launched last year at around $1,500, but the price has since dropped to $1,000. The Oculus Quest 2 is also wireless and more affordable at around $400. Sony’s latest VR headset launched in February at $550, but it requires a PlayStation 5 to power it.  Apple has been long rumored to be coming out with a VR headset, and many expect the company to announce a new product at its annual developer conference in June. Apple’s loyal fanbase and reputation as a leader in consumer technology could validate the market and turn the mainstream toward the world of extended reality. However, just as many will hold out on buying the new PlayStation 5 until there’s a game compelling enough to incentivize them; there will need to be a reason for people, not just gamers, to immerse themselves before they shell out the cash on a headset.  Engage hopes that in the next 10 years, its core product Link could be that reason for businesses, educational institutions and, eventually, creators. Engage’s Central Plaza is a landing pad for all of the other portals, and it’s where you can occasionally find live assistance at the help desk. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage Engage’s Central Plaza is a landing pad for all of the other portals, and it’s where you can occasionally find live assistance at the help desk. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage The main product on the Engage app is Link, a series of “linked, persistent plazas” or virtual worlds that are always on, waiting for someone to explore them. Whelan says to think of Link like the homepage of a website, only way more immersive.  The separate “plazas” are all their own floating islands that serve a specific purpose. The Central Plaza, for example, is basically just a landing spot where you can access all the others, like the Education Plaza, the Apartment Plaza, the Creative Plaza, Template Valley and Tutorial Island. There is also live support there during the hours of 9 am to 1 am Irish Standard Time Monday to Friday, but Whelan hopes to have someone there 24/7 in the future. I tried a few times to catch the live support, and when I finally did, it was anticlimactic. At first I was excited to see another person, not just a random floating avatar, in the space after days of exploring the virtual ghost town alone. I asked him where he was based, if he wore the headset at all times or if he got a ping when someone showed up at the help desk, and what kinds of things he could help me with. The man, bless him, was nervous to be questioned so, a feeling that was clearly exacerbated when I told him I was a journalist. He politely told me to contact Engage for answers to my questions.  Whelan says Engage’s user base is 60% education clients and 40% enterprise, but enterprise clients make up 70% of the company’s revenue. The Enterprise Plaza, therefore, is more developed than other plazas, and it’s where Whelan hopes to see his dream of Engage as the LinkedIn of the metaverse turned to virtual reality.  The Enterprise Plaza in Engage Link leads to portals built for clients like Kia, KPMG and Lenovo. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage The Enterprise Plaza in Engage Link leads to portals built for clients like Kia, KPMG and Lenovo. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage How that’ll actually work in practice is beyond me, partially because it requires multiple people to be in the digital space at the same time. LinkedIn works because people can comment on a post or message someone whenever they happen to see it, so it’ll be interesting to see how Engage hopes to use the Enterprise Plaza to usher in a new way of interaction.  The space looks like an airy billionaire’s lair, a circular two-floor structure with rocky walls, plenty of round conversation pits and palm trees up above. Upon arrival into the plaza, I could hear some kind of elevator music, but also the faint sound of TV news. As I walked closer to the center, where a floating screen rotated with live stock prices for tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Google, the voices got louder and I soon noticed that another screen hovered on the second floor playing Bloomberg Live.  All around the space are watery portals to different company hubs. In fact, in each plaza, the same shimmering portals exist to take you to new worlds. As you get closer to them, you can start to see what’s inside. For example, Pfizer’s shows a lab and Kia’s shows its dealership. Companies like KPMG, HTC and Lenovo have begun using Engage mainly for training and connecting with each other remotely. Often enterprise clients will start in their virtual board room, and then they’ll go enjoy immersive experiences together, such as traveling to the surface of the moon or doing karaoke together.  Because universities are another core customer base of Engage’s, the Education Plaza is also well developed. The virtual space portrays an outside plaza, with stairs in all directions that take you to portals to different universities, like Oxford and Stanford, and educational companies, like Victory XR and Optima Ed. The Education Plaza leads to worlds created by and for universities like Oxford and Stanford, as well as immersive learning like Victory XR and Optima Ed.

Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage Whelan says Meta has funded 10 “metaversities” on the platform, allowing thousands of students around the world to explore both on VR headsets and on mobile phones and tablets.  Jeremy Bailenson, a professor at Stanford University and founding director of the school’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab who studies the psychology of augmented and virtual reality, says Engage is his platform of choice for teaching his students about VR, in VR.  “We’re partnering with them because I think they’re the best to work with,” Bailenson told me, noting that he had tried a range of other platforms like Microsoft’s AltSpace and Meta Horizons and found Engage’s technological development to be superior. “One of the hardest parts about VR is content…It’s easy to find demos that last a minute or two, like an anatomy demo, but how do you fill up a couple of hours of people being together in VR?” Some of the class assignments have included attending a guided meditation in outer space, creating performances with different avatars and building unique scenes using Engage’s in-platform tools. Indeed, I also found that one of the cool things about exploring Engage is just how much content there is, how many worlds there are. Engage says there are around 800 private so-called MetaWorlds owned by the company’s 180+ clients. About 50 of those worlds are accessible to the public via Link.  Fatboy Slim’s world, for example, is available to the public to explore today, and it includes six unique MetaWorlds to create the whole experience: The Diner, the Road Trip, Inside Norm’s Head, the Giant Diner, SkyDiving and Mount Ravemore. It is strange, however, how few people there are in Link. The handful of times I’ve been in there, I have found myself traipsing about alone, like I’m trespassing on private property after hours.  The space might start filling up, though, once Engage makes it even easier to build content and worlds, which might lower the barrier of entry for newbie metaverse users. The company is currently testing an AI named Athena, powered by ChatGPT, to be a front of house assistant.  Athena can “help you with a lot of different tasks in Engage,” according to a video demo. “I can open menus, draw images and create sticky notes; play and control videos; change my voice or gender; load or create objects and IFXs; recenter your headset; adjust audio levels and start and stop recordings.”  “The demo that we’re working towards is the Holodeck demo,” Whelan said, referencing Star Trek’s holographic environment simulator. “You should be able to walk into a metaverse platform which is a complete blank canvas and say, ‘Athena, make a location with six chairs. I want a window. I want a door. I want it to be nighttime outside. I want you to police this location, and here are the watch words. If you hear these words, warn the user that if they repeat these words, they will be banned from this session.” This, he says, is to help ensure that Engage and other metaverse platforms prevent hate speech, usually from “12-year-olds who will go in there and absolutely troll the crap out of everybody, which we’ve seen on many platforms.” Designed and curated by immersive artists and engineers, the Creative Plaza provides an opportunity to explore unique metaworlds and attend art exhibitions.

Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan/Engage Whelan and his wife Sandra founded Engage XR Holdings in 2014, using a €1,000 loan from Whelan’s sister. Under the studio name Immersive VR Education, the company built and shipped the popular Apollo 11 VR and Titanic VR experiences, using Kickstarter campaigns to fund the projects that ended up bringing in millions in revenue, according to Whelan.  In 2018, the company decided to list on the London Stock Exchange, where it raised $7 million to continue to fund Engage. When the pandemic hit, Engage pivoted from focusing mainly on education clients to including business customers. Taiwanese electronics giant HTC asked the company to build it a virtual Vive Ecosystem Conference in early 2020, and then invested about $3 million in Engage.   This year, Engage raised another $10 million, money that it will use to hire more sales, business development and aftercare support employees. This, Whelan says, is a sign that the company is reaching maturity. Engage isn’t profitable yet, but it hopes to get to break-even by late next year. The company generated $4.2 million in 2022, doubling its revenues from the previous year, and expects similar growth year-over-year in 2023.  On the LSX, Engage is trading at £3.30 and has a market cap of  £17.32 million, which Whelan says is partly due to London in particular and Europe in general giving out much lower valuations than in the U.S. “We’ve had a completely crazy journey compared to a lot of companies in the U.S. where VCs go, ‘Oh, you’re awesome. There’s $50 million. Go spend it in the next year and a half and come back to me when you’re worth a billion dollars,’” said Whelan.  By contrast, Engage has learned to grow lean and sustainably. The company only chooses projects where it can win and make money, according to Whelan, and it charges clients not only for the finished product, but also for research and development.  “We’re not like, Hey we’re making cool shit and maybe somebody will buy it at the end. That’s not the way we work.”  That business philosophy might help Engage weather the volatility of the metaverse industry.  In 2021, when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook would be rebranded to Meta, and that the company would be a “metaverse-first” company, the tech world collectively raised an eyebrow. Meta had already spent billions on developing Horizon Worlds, the company’s social VR platform, and so far, the endeavor has been loss-generating. And worse, people aren’t even interested in using the platform.  Toward the end of last year, Meta recorded about 200,000 monthly active users, which is lower than the 500,000 MAUs the company had been aiming for, according to internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Those documents also showed that most users didn’t return to Horizon after the first month on the platform. Only 9% of the worlds are visited by at least 50 people, and most aren’t visited at all, according to the report. Other big companies with stakes in the metaverse have taken steps back in recent months. Disney, for example, recently cut its metaverse team as part of a wave of employee reductions. Microsoft has also cut its Altspace, HoloLens and mixed reality teams. However, the company did say it would focus on Microsoft Mesh, which brings VR experiences to businesses.  Whelan says he’s not worried about the unpredictability. Since Engage is used to running lean, it has plenty of runway to make it through the next few years.  “I think with Meta especially, I think Mark Zuckerberg has the perception at the moment of being pretty uncool,” said Whelan. “He went out with his message about the metaverse two years ago and I think it was probably a little bit too much too soon. But I think when we look back in 10, 15 years, a lot of what he said will actually come to pass, and it’ll be people like Mark that made it happen.” While Engage is geared toward helping businesses and students explore the metaverse, the company said it expects to continue running concerts in the future, and to charge for them, thus bringing in another revenue stream. The Fatboy Slim concert, for example, cost Engage about $200,000 to make, which Whelan says is much cheaper than the average VR studio. A team of three worked on the concert for about six months, but Whelan reckons Engage could do it in three or four months today with two dedicated people.  The Fatboy Slim concert was offered for free and globally in six time zones. I’m told 2,500 people registered for the actual event, and they came from all over — from the U.K. and the U.S. to Australia, the Netherlands and Japan. Whelan said Engage received a ton of requests to join after registration closed.  For his part, Fatboy Slim, AKA Norman Cook, thinks VR could bring about the new era of music videos, rather than the future of concerts.  “It’s a bit disconnected in VR and that’s the thing that’s missing, is that feeling of connectivity. It’s always gonna be a little bit detached,” said Cook. “That’s the one thing you can’t download the experience of.” When the pandemic first hit and everyone was in lockdown, Cook did a different VR show for the Glastonbury Festival with Shangri-La, one of the festival’s after-hours areas. He said it was a true recreation of the Shangri-La stage. You could even wander around to the toilets.  “It was a faithful reproduction, trying to recreate the concert experience, which was interesting but kind of limited,” said Cook.  In the course of building the concert with Engage, Cook said the team tried to bring some of that real-world concert experience to the show by laying crowd noises over the music soundtrack. Cook says it “actually made things worse,” like you’re in a fake reality that’s trying to be real rather than in an alternate reality. If musicians were to explore the use of VR for immersive music videos, “they could take you so much further than you can with a two-dimensional world,” said Cook. Music videos became popular in the 1980s in large part because they allowed artists to illustrate their songs and bring them to life. In recent years, visual albums like Beyonce’s Lemonade have inspired wonder and escapism, expanding the role that music creates. “My music isn’t really storytelling, and it’s not very highbrow. It’s just a load of scratchy noises to turn you on, repeated memes that take you somewhere,” said Cook. “If you multiply what I do by the imagination of someone like Radiohead or Lady Gaga, it could really be a beautiful thing. It would be like going to a movie where you’re just so immersed in all the action of it, and mixing that 3D world with a song that already takes you somewhere emotionally in the first place.”"
274,Meta rolls out new discovery and personalization controls for Facebook Reels,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 2, 2023","Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced today that the company is introducing new features that make it easier for users to discover and personalize Facebook Reels recommendations. The company is launching new personalization controls for Reels that let users customize what they want to see more or less of. Now when you see a Reel, you can tap the three-dot menu at the bottom of the video player and select either “Show More” or “Show Less.” Users will start to see this option at the bottom of Reels as well as videos in the Watch feed. If you select the “Show More” option on a Reel, Facebook will temporarily increase its ranking score and for Reels like it. Selecting the “Show Less” option will temporarily decrease its ranking score. Facebook previously rolled out the Show More and Show Less buttons to regular posts on the social network. Image Credits: Facebook Image Credits: Facebook Facebook is also introducing new labels on the Reels video player to explain why you’re seeing a certain reel. For instance, Facebook will now tell you that it’s showing a certain Reel because a friend of yours liked it. In addition, Facebook is making it easier to discover relevant Reels by adding Reels to the main navigation at the top of Facebook Watch to give users quick access to short-form videos. Additionally, when watching videos on Facebook, users will now be able to scroll between Reels and long-form videos. Today’s announcement comes a few weeks after Meta added support for longer Facebook Reels of up to 90 seconds, along with some new creative tools, including a new templates feature that lets users create Reels with trending templates. Meta has previously said that Reels is its fastest-growing format and that it continues to grow quickly. Last week, Zuckerberg said during Meta’s quarterly earnings call that time spent on Instagram has grown more than 24% since the company launched Reels on the platform thanks to AI-powered content recommendations. Meta CFO Susan Li seemed to shy away from an analyst question regarding whether Reels was having a similar impact on Facebook, but did repeatedly note that on Facebook, AI-driven recommendations that don’t come from direct connections are increasing engagement among users.

275,"LinkedIn rolls out ways to verify your identity and employment, without a price tag",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 12, 2023","LinkedIn is introducing new ways to verify your identity and where you work, the company announced on Wednesday. Unlike with Twitter and Meta, LinkedIn’s new verification measures don’t include paid subscriptions or blue checkmarks. The company is partnering with CLEAR, a secure identity platform, to provide verification for LinkedIn users in the United States. Starting this month, users can display on your profile that they verified your identity with CLEAR. To do so, you need to provide your government-issued ID and phone number. Once you verify your identity, your profile will display a new “Verifications” section under the “Connect” and “Message” buttons. Users who visit your profile will see a checkmark next to a “Government ID” banner that will indicate that you have “a verified government ID.” LinkedIn users around the world also have the option to verify where they work with their company email. To confirm your place of employment, you have to enter a verification code sent to your company email address. LinkedIn notes that this feature works with more than 4,000 companies on the platform. The platform plans to roll out this option to more companies over time. Image Credits: LinkedIn Image Credits: LinkedIn Alternatively, LinkedIn has partnered with Microsoft to allow organizations to leverage the Microsoft Entra Verified ID platform to issue digital workplace IDs for free for eligible users. The new option will roll out at the end of this month. LinkedIn plans to make this option available to dozens of participating companies reaching more than two million LinkedIn members. “Through all these new, free features, we’re helping give you the confidence that who you’re connecting with and the content you come across is trusted and authentic,” the company wrote in a blog post. “While all LinkedIn members globally won’t have access to these verification options immediately, we will expand availability and ways for you to participate over time. We’ll keep you updated as we continue rolling out more features like these.” The new verification features come as LinkedIn introduced ways to verify your phone number and email last fall. It’s worth noting that these two verification options aren’t displayed on your profile with verification badges, unlike the new options announced today, which have a prominent space on user profiles. Unlike Twitter and Meta, which bundled verification with additional features, LinkedIn is choosing to keep its verification features focused on confirming users’ identifies in the hopes of providing an extra layer of protection when it comes to fake or scam accounts. Twitter’s paid verification option is bundled with its Blue subscription, which costs $8 per month, and gives users access to other perks like fewer ads. Meta’s verification option, called Meta Verified, is available on Instagram and Facebook and costs $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on mobile. LinkedIn says it believes verification should be available for everyone, which is why its verification features will be available for free.  "
276,"Blue checks reappear on Twitter if you update your bio, lmao",['@asilbwrites'],"May 1, 2023","Jumpscare alert: There is currently a bug on Twitter wherein legacy blue check holders can update their bio and briefly get their badge of (dis)honor back. It doesn’t seem to matter what text you’re adding to your bio — I added a few spaces, then got my check back for a moment. It even showed up with the old text that designates that I am “notable in government, news, entertainment, or another designated category,” and I did not, in fact, pay for this. But once you refresh the page it disappears (which I am grateful for, because I do not want people to think I am giving Elon Musk money). In fact, it’s unclear whether anyone else can even see your check briefly reappear (which, again, I am grateful for, because I do not want people to think I am giving Elon Musk money). Image Credits: TechCrunch Image Credits: TechCrunch Twitter still retains code that shows which users are legacy verified, as opposed to Blue verified. So, this bug is likely caused by a glitch involving those internal designations. But we can’t know for sure, because if we were to email Twitter asking for comment, they would just email us back a poop emoji. Once again, it seems that if you lay off the majority of your staff, your social platform will not be coded particularly well.    "
277,Discover the Disrupt 2023 Fintech Stage,['@bayareawriter'],"March 30, 2023","TechCrunch Disrupt, the premier event for startup investors and founders, is coming back September 19-21, 2023, with an enhanced new format.  This year, we’re rethinking TC Sessions, the standalone industry events series, and merging them into the big annual tech event — which will once again this year be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Disrupt will have six industry tracks, each with its own stage, including AI, fintech, hardware, SaaS, security and sustainability. On the Fintech Stage we will have some of the biggest industry players discussing some of the hottest 2023 fintech trends.  The specific areas we’re eager to dig into this year via panels and fireside chats on the Fintech Stage featuring top executives in the industry include: the future of payments, the sustainability of buy now, pay later, scaling blockchains to onboard masses and the value of embedded tech. Come join us! The world of fintech is an ever-evolving one as the digital transformation of financial services has accelerated full force since the onset of the pandemic (and continues). By definition, fintech represents the use of technology to improve, enhance or automate financial services. It’s a broad term that encompasses many areas, including payments, banking, credit and crypto. We believe that ultimately the goal of fintech should be to improve the lives of people all around the globe, in some cases opening up access to those previously underserved and in others giving more options when it comes to spending, saving and investing your (or your company’s) money. While venture funding in fintech slowed last year, companies in the space were still the top recipient of venture dollars worldwide. In fact, storied venture firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) invested more in fintech than any other category in 2022. And in 2023, investors still see much opportunity as founders all over continue to challenge the status quo. We hope you can join us September 19-21 at Disrupt 2023 and check out the fintech day of programming. Early Bird passes are currently on sale — save $800 when you book by May 14."
278,Viam’s robot prototyping software hits general availability,['@bheater'],"May 2, 2023","When I visited Viam’s Manhattan offices late last year, I was struck by two things. First, there’s a killer view of Lincoln Center. As the weather is getting warmer and they’re starting to do those all-ages outdoor movie screenings, you can probably just hang out up there and watch the whole thing from the other side of 9th Avenue. Second, the firm set up quite a bit of space in their well-appointed 54,000-square-foot office for startups, developers and the like to work with their robotics software offering. In October, Viam announced a public beta of its product and has been working to get the platform into as many hands as possible, from meetups to this video it co-produced with our buddy Simone Giertz. Existing customers include Dexai Robotics, HAX, Newlab and Sol Robotics. Viam’s platform hits general availability today, providing support from the prototyping stage to fleet management. “With innovation slowed down by the high time and resource costs for development, we felt that there was a significant opportunity to do something incredibly important,” co-founder and CEO Eliot Horowitz said in a release. “Robotics can help improve so many industries, from agriculture to food service, to medicine and climate solutions, but we need to break down barriers of working with robotics.” Fleet management is a nut a lot of the competition is attempting to crack at the moment, offering robotics customers the ability to deploy and monitor these systems at scale. Interoperability has been a bit of a bugbear as well. Many robotics providers offer their own version of fleet management, though these tend to be limiting, with exclusive support for first-party hardware. One of the things that makes Viam’s offering relatively unique in this world is the company’s push to be a kind of one-stop shop that also includes a focus on the production and security sides of the equation. Viam is continuing to offer a free tier, while adding three different premium packages for additional support."
279,Elon Musk says Twitter will only show verified accounts on its algorithmic timeline,['@indianidle'],"March 28, 2023","In the latest chapter in the saga of Elon Musk and his strange Twitter decisions, the social network’s CEO has declared that Twitter will only show verified accounts on the algorithmic “For You” timeline starting April 15. In a tweet, Musk justified the move by saying this was the “only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over.” While the Tesla CEO suggested that the move to prohibit non-verified accounts from recommendations was to tackle bots, he said that “verified” bots that don’t impersonate humans would be eligible to be shown on the “For You” timeline. So essentially, you have to be a paid user, a brand, or a government official to be recommended by Twitter’s algorithm. That said, it’s ok to have verified bot accounts if they follow terms of service & don’t impersonate a human — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2023  Twitter has been trying to promote the “For You” timeline for a while now despite negative opinions from many users. The move to make it a verified-only algorithmic feed won’t be a popular decision either. Notably, analysts suggest that Twitter has only 385,000 paying users at the moment. Plus, the company is removing legacy verification checkmarks from previously notable accounts on April 1. So the algorithmic feed will be filled by paid accounts in addition to brands and officials’ accounts, which may make it a very skewed timeline for people who follow a variety of accounts. Musk also said that only verified accounts will be able to take part in polls going forward. But it’s unclear if that is meant to be polls created by Twitter (or him), or all polls on the platform. As always, the announcement is confusing. Last year, Twitter briefly instated a policy to ban handles and links to other social networks like Facebook and Instagram. The move backfired, and after heavy criticism, the company reversed the rule. At that time, Musk said that every major policy decision would go through a poll (Spoiler: it hasn’t). Soon after, he launched a poll asking people if he should step down as a CEO. By the end of it, 57.5% voted in favor. After these events, several people suggested that bots accounted for a lot of these votes. At that time, Musk took note of a user suggestion to limit policy voting to only paying subscribers. It looks like he’s finally implementing this change. This development comes in the wake of GitHub taking down a repository of leaked Twitter sourced code. Musk has promised to open source the social network’s recommendation algorithm on March 31."
280,Klarna plugs ChatGPT into its platform for faster product recommendations,['@christinemhall'],"March 23, 2023","Payments and shopping service Klarna is the latest company to announce its integration with ChatGPT. The company said it is “one of the first brands to work with OpenAI to use its protocol to build an integrated Plugin for ChatGPT” and is rolling out a personalized shopping experience that provides product recommendations when Klarna users ask for shopping advice, inspiration and product links via Klarna’s search and compare tool. Here’s how it works: Users install the Klarna plugin from the ChatGPT plugin store and then can ask ChatGPT questions. For example, “I have $150, which headphones can I afford?” and receive a selection of items relevant to that request. Users can also ask other questions or for more product recommendations. If users tap on the product link, they can also navigate to the product page on Klarna’s search and compare tool to compare prices across its 500,000 retail partners, the company said. “I’m super excited about our plugin with ChatGPT because it passes my ‘north star’ criteria that I call my ‘mom test,’ i.e. would my mom understand and benefit from this,” said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of Klarna, in a written statement. “And it does because it’s easy to use and genuinely solves a ton of problems — it drives tremendous value for everyone. Klarna is in a unique position to leverage the best technology and data to help people discover new products and solve problems for consumers at every stage of the shopping journey, and we’ll continue innovating to bring these services to our 150 million consumers.” The company said the plugin will roll out initially to ChatGPT Plus subscribers in the U.S. and Canada and will then become available in other regions “following a period of safety testing, development and improvement.” Last month, Klarna revealed that the U.S. was its biggest market after seeing a 71% year-over-year increase in gross merchandise value (GMV) in the U.S. last year compared to 2021. In addition, the Klarna Card went live last June in the U.S. with a 1 million-person wait list. The new feature comes amid OpenAI’s own announcement that it launched plugins for ChatGPT and connected the chatbot to the internet. Klarna is among some pretty big tech players getting in on generative AI, including Apple, all things Microsoft and Google.    "
281,Computer or casino?,['@alex'],"April 13, 2023","It’s been more than a decade since I first starting covering Bitcoin, and I feel like I’ve seen the ups and downs of crypto. From the Mt. Gox days through the ICO boom and the later NFT cycle, it’s been a fascinating ride. The web3 world that Bitcoin kicked off back in 2009 has been a tumultuous and absorbing financial and technological story. My optimism for blockchain-based tech has also gone through ups and downs. Just as I worried for the viability of my index funds every time crypto prices went vertical, I’ve also wondered whether it was the final straw for Bitcoin and friends every time the web3 hype cycle imploded. But no matter how high the high, how low the low or how fast the transition between the two, crypto has managed to come back in one form or another. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. At some point you give up trying to predict what will happen and when, and you must simply watch. Investors are not playing the same game. The venture market by its nature is a wager-placing activity. VCs think up a thesis, find what they consider to be outstanding startups that fit their market hypothesis, fund them, and then try to help those startups become big. So long as some of the companies that they pick do well, they can earn back all the capital they invested and share in the profits. The thesis portion of the venture game is sometimes hard to parse from the outside. Many investors are low key when it comes to speaking publicly, so we have to watch their deal flow to get a taste of where they see the future going. Some investors, in contrast, like to make a bit more noise. It’s often useful. Bessemer’s regular cloud reports discuss a portion of that firm’s investing thesis. Since the Bessemer documents are chock-full of useful data and are often unsparing in their market diagnosis they are worth reading. It was with that vibe that I dug into the most recent a16z crypto market update."
282,"Paramount+ announces original movie, ‘Star Trek: Section 31,’ starring Michelle Yeoh",['@laurenforristal'],"April 18, 2023","Paramount+ has ordered a “Star Trek: Section 31” original movie event with Michelle Yeoh reprising her role as Emperor Philippa Georgiou, according to a blog post on the “Star Trek” official website. This will be the first Star Trek movie based on a character from the 2017 series “Star Trek: Discovery.” A release date has yet to be announced. Production begins later this year. ""I’m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family.""
Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh will star in #StarTrekSection31, a special movie event coming to @ParamountPlus! pic.twitter.com/QHKYim06PC — Star Trek on Paramount+ (@StarTrekOnPPlus) April 18, 2023  Details on the plot are slim. However, we know that “Star Trek: Section 31” will follow Georgiou, the original captain of the ship Shenzhou. She joins a secret division of Starfleet, Section 31, which is tasked to protect the security interests of an interstellar alliance called the United Federation of Planets. Georgiou will also have to face “the sins of her past,” the StarTrek.com staff wrote. The emperor is actually a Mirrorverse duplicate of Georgiou, who appears later in the first season of “Star Trek: Discovery.” (Spoiler alert: the original Georgiou was killed in the 2017 series). The Mirrorverse is a universe where the people are corrupt versions of the people in the main universe. “I’m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family and to the role I’ve loved for so long,” Yeoh said in a statement. “Section 31 has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of Star Trek launched. To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that’s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can’t wait to share what’s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise)!” “Star Trek: Section 31” was initially reported to be a spinoff series in 2018 and went into active development in 2019. While it’s unclear why Paramount+ chose to make it a movie instead, this will be the first Star Trek film to center on a single character. “All the way back in 2017, before the first season of ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ had even aired, Michelle had the idea to do a spin-off for her character, Philippa Georgiou,” said executive producer Alex Kurtzman. “She broke new ground as one of the first two women on screen in the pilot to usher in a new age of Trek, and now, six years later, ‘Star Trek: Section 31’ finally arrives on the heels of her latest groundbreaking win. Everyone on Team Trek couldn’t be more thrilled to have our legendary friend return home to us as we expand our storytelling into new and uncharted corners of the Trekverse. Long live Emperor Georgiou; long live Michelle Yeoh!,” Kurtzman added."
283,iPhone sales help Apple beat revenue forecasts for Q2,['@bheater'],"May 4, 2023","Everyone knew this would be a rough quarterly earnings report, but the question was just how rough. Facing broader economic headwinds and a slowing smartphone market, Apple reported its second straight quarterly sales drop. Still, the company managed to beat Wall Street forecasts, on the strength of better-than-expected iPhone revenue. Apple itself issued no formal guidance ahead of earnings, a move implemented and maintained since the earliest days of the pandemic. Apple sold $51.3 billion worth of iPhones for Q2, beating an expected $48.8 billion for the quarter. The category’s growth amounted to only 2% for the quarter, but it’s still being regarded as a win. “We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,” Tim Cook said in a release. “We continue to invest for the long term and lead with our values, including making major progress toward building carbon neutral products and supply chains by 2030.” The broader smartphone market has stagnated and begun to contract, owing to financial concerns and various factors limiting demand. Apple certainly hasn’t been immune to such stresses, but the company is believed to have benefited from a boast from supply chain corrections. The bump in iPhone sales is especially critical as the company failed to hit revenue forecasts for the Mac, iPad and other hardware. Even services, which have been the key for the company as it shifts away from a dependency on consumer hardware, fell short of expectations. Mac revenue, which was expected to hit $7.8 billion for the quarter, came in at $7.2 billion. In a recent study, analyst firm Canalys noted a 40.5% drop in Mac shipments for Q2. It was a bad quarter for PC sellers all around, but Apple was hit especially hard. iPad just barely fell short, at $6.67 billion versus an expected $6.69 billion. Ditto for services. The category, which includes things like iCloud, Apple TV Plus and Apple Music, reached $20.91 billion, just short of the expect $20.97 billion. Given a difficult business climate for growth, all eyes are on the company’s stock repurchases as a way to drive investor return. Apple delivered: “Given our confidence in Apple’s future and the value we see in our stock,” says CFO Luca Maestri, “our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. We are also raising our quarterly dividend for the eleventh year in a row.” The company has, thus far, managed to buck the industry trend of wide-scale layoffs, which have impacted competitors like Google, Amazon and Meta. In an interview with CNBC, Cook said layoffs are not on the immediate horizon for Apple. “I view that as a last resort and, so, mass layoffs is not something that we’re talking about at this moment,” the exec explained. Shares of Apple lost just under 1% during regular trading hours, and after reporting its earnings it has rallied just over 1%. Put another way, Wall Street has digested the company’s aggregate results, new buyback authorization and rising dividend and decided to not change the company’s value materially. That could change after its earnings call, but for now Apple has, at a minimum, defended its $2.6 trillion market cap."
284,Twitter will now show labels on tweets with reduced visibility,['@indianidle'],"April 25, 2023","Twitter said today that it will add labels to tweets that have been flagged by the company to reduce their visibility. Elon Musk & Co. touted this as a “freedom of speech, not reach” move. 🚫Censorship
🚫Shadowbanning
✅Freedom of speech, not reach. Our new labels are now live. https://t.co/a0nTyPSZWY — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) April 24, 2023  Last week, the social media company first made the announcement about visibility saying that the label provides more transparency into the company’s process for reducing the reach of hateful tweets. “Restricting the reach of Tweets helps reduce binary ‘leave up versus take down’ content moderation decisions and supports our freedom of speech vs freedom of reach approach,” the company said at that time. “However, like other social platforms, we have not historically been transparent when we’ve taken this action.” Twitter said that labels will be shown to both authors and viewers. Usually, these tweets will show text such as “Visibility limited: this Tweet may violate Twitter’s rules against Hateful Conduct.” Image Credits: Twitter Image Credits: Twitter Twitter’s enforcement policy says that tweets with such labels will not show up in search results, recommendations or timelines — those tweets will be hidden in both the “For You” and “Following timelines. Additionally, there will be no ads placed adjacent to posts with reduced visibility. The company admitted that there might be mistakes in labeling these tweets, so authors can submit feedback. Twitter said that this action “does not guarantee you will receive a response or that your Tweet’s reach will be restored.” Notably, under the previous management, Twitter geo-restricted tweets and accounts in certain regions upon local government’s requests. Twitter states that the new visibility policy will be more granular as it will be applied at the tweet level, and not the account level. It’s not clear if Twitter will restrict the reach of a tweet if someone quotes the tweet in question to point out the label. Similarly, drawing attention to tweets with reduced visibility might have the opposite effect as people may start sharing screenshots of those tweets. Since Musk took over the social network and became its new owner, he has cut down on staff in moderation and safety verticals. The new management has also put emphasis on developing crowdsourced moderation tools for Community Notes in an effort to try and reduce the burden on staff and contractors."
285,"Amazon opens its low-bandwidth, long-range Sidewalk network to developers",['@fredericl'],"March 28, 2023","Back in 2019, Amazon announced Sidewalk, its low-bandwidth, long-range wireless network that uses the 900 MHz spectrum to connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It does this by connecting these devices to Amazon’s own Echo and Ring devices, who share a small part of their owner’s bandwidth. Ideally, this means Sidewalk will be able to connect devices that sit beyond the reach of a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signal. Until now, though, only a select number of developers were able to build applications for the network. But that’s changing today. The company is now shipping software and hardware development kits, as well as an easy-to-use test kit to test the available Sidewalk connectivity in your neighborhood. Using the new test kit, developers will be able to check their local signal strength on a map to get a better sense of whether their devices will be able to connect to the network before they start working on a product. Amazon sent me one of these Ring-branded devices to try. Getting started with it involves little more than powering it up (it does have a battery for mobile usage) and logging into Amazon’s web-based Sidewalk coverage service. From there, you can quickly see all of the raw data from the GPS-enabled test kit and get access to Amazon’s U.S.-wide coverage map. To ensure user privacy, the coverage maps only show coverage within a 900m-by-900m square area. You will be able to see the exact location of your own device, but not other devices that report into the coverage map. “We’ve rapidly built out a long-range, low-bandwidth network that now covers more than 90% of the U.S. population, and this is an open invitation for developers to put it to the test,” said Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon Devices & Services. “Many types of connected devices have been limited by the range of Wi-Fi and the cost of cellular technology, which has hindered the ability to connect devices like environmental sensors, leak detectors and smart locks. Sidewalk is designed to provide a secure, low-cost way to invent and connect a whole new range of devices, and we can’t wait to see what developers build.” Sidewalk coverage map. Image Credits: Amazon Sidewalk coverage map. Image Credits: Amazon For the software development kits, Amazon partnered with Nordic Semiconductor, Silicon Labs, Texas Instruments and module vendor Quectel. These companies will also offer hardware development kits, with Quectel launching a Sidewalk connectivity module that will allow developers to quickly take Sidewalk-enabled devices into production. Amazon is also launching mobile SDKs for iOS and Android to help developers build Sidewalk into their mobile apps. The company is also launching an app that will help developers debug and troubleshoot their devices in the field. It’s worth noting that Sidewalk is also natively integrated with AWS’ IoT Core service, which allows businesses to connect and manage their fleets of IoT devices. “The integration of AWS IoT Core and Amazon Sidewalk marks a significant milestone for developers, manufacturers and customers, streamlining the design, connection and deployment of Amazon Sidewalk based IoT solutions,” said Yasser Alsaied, vice president of IoT at Amazon Web Services. “Now, with AWS IoT Core for Amazon Sidewalk, developers can access 200+ AWS services to build scalable solutions on top of a highly reliable, secure and free-to-connect wireless network.”      "

Generative AI isn’t just about creative endeavors and parlor tricks. Investors and Big Tech alike are betting that it will also affect enterprise infrastructure and cybersecurity, and they are putting money where their mouth is. — Anna Y Combinator Demo Days are a strong indicator of the trends investors might be interested in — and that’s one of the main reasons why TechCrunch always watches them pretty closely. In its Winter 2023 batch, three areas stood out, the accelerator said: “open source, dev tools and AI.” Dev tools startups in that batch drew particularly strong interest among investors, with four of them raising additional funding just weeks after Demo Day, Insider reported. AI-related startups, on the other hand, were very popular with founders, representing 34% of the winter cohort. While these areas can be looked at separately, I’m more interested in how they might overlap, so I called up Israeli VC Rona Segev to see what she had to say — not only because Israel has positioned itself as a hotspot for dev tools, but also because almost half of her portfolio involves AI in some form. Segev, the co-founder and managing partner of VC firm TLV Partners, thinks that generative AI could lead to innovative ways for companies to explore and manage their infrastructure. "

But what about the general partners who are sending money back to their LPs? Now that “the venture math has changed,” Natasha Mascarenhas spoke to solo GPs who’ve wired back funds to their limited partners, or in one case, urged them to cancel their subscriptions. “I can’t imagine an institutional LP is going to be as open-minded to investing in a single person doing lots of investing on their own without a team or partnership model,” said Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia.

288,US tech giants warn India’s fact-checking rule will ‘profoundly infringe’ on press freedom,['@refsrc'],"April 17, 2023","The Asia Internet Coalition, an influential industry organization representing technology giants such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple and Amazon, has voiced concerns over a recent amendment to India’s IT rules, saying the changes grant the local government expansive content removal authority without implementing adequate procedural safeguards. India recently updated its IT rules, barring social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter from publishing, sharing or hosting false or misleading information about the government’s business affairs. Under the new regulations, these firms must rely on New Delhi’s own fact-checking unit to verify claims. India is a key overseas market for Facebook, Twitter and Google. Facebook and Google have ploughed more than $15 billion into India in the past decade as they raced to win the last great growth market. Their services now reach more than half a billion users in India. The firms have previously pushed back against several of New Delhi’s proposals. The amendments lack the “sufficient procedural safeguards” to protect people’s fundamental rights to access information, said Jeff Paine, managing director of AIC in a statement Monday. Relying on a government agency such as the Press Information Bureau as the sole source to fact-check government business without giving it a clear definition or providing clear checks and balances “may lead to misuse during implementation of the law, which will profoundly infringe on press freedom,” Paine added. The industry body recommended New Delhi to host industry-wide consultations and also “consider voluntary mechanisms to protect the benefits of the internet and keep people safe from harm.” The pushback follows the Editors Guild of India saying earlier this month that it was deeply disturbed by the government’s move to police news on social media. “All this is against principles of natural justice, and akin to censorship. The ministry’s notification of such draconian rules is therefore regrettable. The Guild again urges the ministry to withdraw this notification and conduct consultations with media organisations and press bodies,” the group said. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, India minister of state for IT, said in an online discussion last week that it was “not true” that the government-appointed unit was planning to censor journalism."

Instacart notes that users can take advantage of in-store deal perks at certain retailers while shopping online by adding loyalty cards to their account. “Instacart has helped customers save more than $2 billion on Instacart orders with deals, discounts, and membership benefits,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Access to affordable fresh groceries and everyday essentials has never been more important, and we want everyone to be able to take advantage of the more than 20,000 deals available near them on Instacart.” In its blog post, Instacart highlighted that Instacart+ members receive free delivery on orders over $35, and its next-day delivery option offers free delivery plus a discount if you schedule your groceries ahead of time. The subscription service costs $99 per year or $9.99 per month. Last year, Instacart announced that it will expand its EBT SNAP payments program to all Instacart retail grocery partners by 2030. The company also said it will allow customers to shop on Instacart using their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits in the future. TANF is a government cash assistance program that helps low-income families purchase everyday essentials.  "
290,Nintendo and mobile games company DeNA launch Nintendo Systems,['@laurenforristal'],"April 3, 2023","Back in November, Nintendo and app developer DeNA announced its joint venture company called Nintendo Systems, which is meant to help reinforce Nintendo’s business and “create value-added services,” according to Nintendo’s Japanese website. Today, the companies officially launched the Nintendo Systems website. “Nintendo Systems was born in April 2023, led by a team of engineers from Nintendo and DeNA, to create a system that makes it easy to deliver Nintendo entertainment to consumers,” Nintendo and DeNA wrote in a message posted on the new Nintendo Systems website (loosely translated from Japanese to English). The eight-year-old partnership between Nintendo and DeNA dates back to 2015. The companies have worked on various titles together, such as Super Mario Run, Mario Kart Tour, Pokémon Masters and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, among others. “The technology surrounding the Internet is changing at a dizzying pace day by day and is becoming more complex. Under these circumstances, Nintendo Systems will leverage the relationship of trust between Nintendo and DeNA, which has been cultivated through a partnership of more than seven years, and use Nintendo’s originality and DeNA’s knowledge of technology as the driving force to create new innovations for the world,” the companies added. It’s not yet known what exactly the two companies are currently working on together. At this time, no games or software have been announced. TechCrunch reached out to Nintendo for comment. Nintendo’s Tetsuya Sasaki is the president of Nintendo Systems. In 1995, Sasaki joined the company as a software engineer for the Entertainment Analysis & Development Division. He is credited for his work on titles like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Wii Sports and Mario Kart DS.  "

292,What is Auto-GPT and why does it matter?,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 22, 2023","Silicon Valley’s quest to automate everything is unceasing, which explains its latest obsession: Auto-GPT. In essence, Auto-GPT uses the versatility of OpenAI’s latest AI models to interact with software and services online, allowing it to “autonomously” perform tasks like X and Y. But as we are learning with large language models, this capability seems to be as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. Auto-GPT — which you might’ve seen blowing up on social media recently — is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI’s text-generating models, mainly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to act “autonomously.” There’s no magic in that autonomy. Auto-GPT simply handles follow-ups to an initial prompt of OpenAI’s models, both asking and answering them until a task is complete. Auto-GPT, basically, is GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 paired with a companion bot that instructs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 what to do. A user tells Auto-GPT what their goal is and the bot, in turn, uses GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and several programs to carry out every step needed to achieve whatever goal they’ve set. What makes Auto-GPT reasonably capable is its ability to interact with apps, software and services both online and local, like web browsers and word processors. For example, given a prompt like “help me grow my flower business,” Auto-GPT can develop a somewhat plausible advertising strategy and build a basic website. #AutoGPT is the new disruptive kid on the block- It can apply #ChatGPT's reasoning to broader, more intricate issues requiring planning & multiple steps. Still early but very impressive with many health and biomedicine applications. Just tried #AgentGPT and asked it to… pic.twitter.com/ywFhtjxjYD — Daniel Kraft, MD (@daniel_kraft) April 12, 2023  As Joe Koen, a software developer who’s experimented with Auto-GPT, explained to TechCrunch via email, Auto-GPT essentially automates multi-step projects that would’ve required back-and-forth prompting with a chatbot-oriented AI model like, say, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “Auto-GPT defines an agent that communicates with OpenAI’s API,” Koen said. “This agent’s objective is to carry out a variety of commands that the AI generates in response to the agent’s requests. The user is prompted for input to specify the AI’s role and objectives prior to the agent starting to carry out commands.” In a terminal, users describe the Auto-GPT agent’s name, role and objective and specify up to five ways to achieve that objective. For example: Behind the scenes, Auto-GPT relies on features like memory management to execute tasks, along with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for text generation, file storage and summarization. Auto-GPT can also be hooked up to speech synthesizers, like ElevenLabs’, so that it can “place” phone calls, for example. Auto-GPT is publicly available on GitHub, but it does require some setup and know-how to get up and running. To use it, Auto-GPT has to be installed in a development environment like Docker, and it must be registered with an API key from OpenAI — which requires a paid OpenAI account. It might be worth it — although the jury’s out on that. Early adopters have used Auto-GPT to take on the sorts of mundane tasks better delegated to a bot. For example, Auto-GPT can field items like debugging code and writing an email or more advanced things, like creating a business plan for a new startup. “If Auto-GPT encounters any obstacles or inability to finish the task, it’ll develop new prompts to help it navigate the situation and determine the appropriate next steps,” Adnan Masood, the chief architect at UST, a tech consultancy firm, told TechCrunch in an email. “Large language models excel at generating human-like responses, yet rely on user prompts and interactions to deliver desired outcomes. In contrast, Auto-GPT leverages the advanced capabilities of OpenAI’s API to operate independently without user intervention.” In recent weeks, new apps have emerged to make Auto-GPT even easier to use, like AgentGPT and GodMode, which provide a simple interface where users can input what they want to accomplish directly on a browser page. Note that, like Agent-GPT, both require an API key from OpenAI to unlock their full capabilities. Like any powerful tool, however, Auto-GPT has its limitations — and risks. AutoGPT just exceeded PyTorch itself in GitHub stars (74k vs 65k). I see AutoGPT as a fun experiment, as the authors point out too. But nothing more. Prototypes are not meant to be production-ready. Don't let media fool you – most of the ""cool demos"" are heavily cherry-picked: 🧵 pic.twitter.com/I44H7BkCqr — Jim Fan (@DrJimFan) April 16, 2023  Depending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself. There’s also ChaosGPT, a modified version of Auto-GPT tasked with goals like “destroy humanity” and “establish global dominance.” Unsurprisingly, ChaosGPT hasn’t come close to bringing about the robot apocalypse — but it has tweeted rather unflatteringly about humankind. Arguably more dangerous than Auto-GPT attempting to “destroy humanity” are the unanticipated problems that can crop up in otherwise perfectly normal scenarios, though. Because it’s built on OpenAI’s language models — models that, like all language models, are prone to inaccuracies — it can make errors. That’s not the only problem. After successfully completing a task, Auto-GPT usually doesn’t recall how to perform it for later use, and — even when it does — it often won’t remember to use the program. Auto-GPT also struggles to effectively break complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and has trouble understanding how different goals overlap. “Auto-GPT illustrates the power and unknown risks of generative AI,” Clara Shih, the CEO of Salesforce’s Service Cloud and an Auto-GPT enthusiast, said via email. “For enterprises, it is especially important to include a human in the loop approach when developing and using generative AI technologies like Auto-GPT.”"

295,Reliance-backed Dunzo nears fresh funding of $50 million,['@refsrc'],"March 30, 2023","Indian hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo is in late-stage discussions to secure about $50 million in a new financing round, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch, as the Bengaluru-headquartered startup scrambles for comfort amid a funding winter for younger firms. Reliance Retail and Google, the company’s two existing backers, are among those in discussion to invest in the new round, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the information is private. The funding deliberations are currently moving ahead largely with existing backers, the sources said. The startup has been in the market to raise capital for several months and was looking to raise at least $70 million and as much as $150 million, according to Indian newspaper Economic Times. Kabeer Biswas, co-founder and chief executive of Dunzo, declined to comment. Google and Reliance Retail did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dunzo competes with Swiggy’s Instamart, YC Continuity-backed Zepto, Tata-owned BigBasket and Zomato’s BlinkIt, all of which are attempting to take a slice of India’s retail market, which is estimated to grow to over $800 billion by 2025, according to estimates by brokerage firm Bernstein. Delivery startups, typically among the most cash-guzzling businesses, are unsurprisingly finding it especially challenging to raise new financing rounds amid the globally weakening economy. Karthik Gurumurthy, the head of Swiggy’s Instamart business, said on Friday he is leaving the role. Building Instamart has been “arduous with a lot of compromises on physical and mental wellbeing,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. It’s a dynamic that is playing out globally. Europe’s rapid delivery market has consolidated down to three companies. Instacart has cut its internal valuation to $10 billion, down from $39 billion in March 2021.

296,What is Bluesky? Everything to know about the app trying to replace Twitter,"['Amanda Silberling', 'Alyssa Stringer']","May 5, 2023","Is the grass greener on the other side? We’re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It’s been over a year since Elon Musk announced his bid to buy Twitter, and those who opposed the sale have tried setting up shop on platforms like Mastodon, Substack Notes, T2… but none of these Twitter alternatives have really captured lightning in a bottle like Bluesky. Bluesky remains invite-only in its beta, but as more people get on the site, the hype around it is growing — though as we know from apps like Clubhouse, the hype might not last forever. In the meantime, Bluesky now has around 50,000 users, but according to estimates from data.ai, the app has been downloaded more than 375,000 times. So many people are trying to get an invite that they’ve started popping up for sale on eBay (we would advise against making that purchase). Bluesky is a decentralized social app conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation. Bluesky is using an open source framework built in-house, the AT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed. Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so as of late 2022, Bluesky is completely divorced from Twitter. Dorsey has even used Bluesky to express his dismay with Musk’s leadership. Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. 🧵 — jack (@jack) December 11, 2019  Once invited, users create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, TechCrunch’s Darrell Etherington is known on Bluesky as @etherington.com. The app itself functions much like a bare-bones Twitter, where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text. You can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. There’s also a “What’s Hot” timeline, which surfaces engaging posts. User profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like Twitter: posts and posts & replies. There is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates. Image Credits: Natalie Christman Image Credits: Natalie Christman New users receive one invite code every two weeks that they’re on the Bluesky app. The company monitors the social graph, giving users that are inviting trustworthy participants more invite codes to share. Long-term, Bluesky says it views the invite code system as a piece of the open source tool it’s building to help server admins to curate and moderate their communities. By the end of April 2023, Bluesky reached 50,000 users on the platform. Notable figures and organizations, from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to Twitter exile NPR, have found a new home on Bluesky. In many ways, yes. However, Bluesky does not yet have DMs or some advanced tools like adding accounts to lists. Additionally, Twitter does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or AT. Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter. But the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021. Yes, but it is currently invite-only access. Yes. Bluesky’s team is developing the decentralized AT Protocol, which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans  to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data. Yes. Bluesky rolled out to Android users on April 20 and was initially launched to iOS users in late February. The platform technically doesn’t have a web app yet, but if you’re logged in and go to staging.bsky.app, a whole new world will open up for you. There is technically no name for posts, but internet users have adopted the name “skeets,” a portmanteau of “tweet” and “sky.” Users still widely refer to posts as “skeets,” despite protests from Bluesky CEO Jay Graber and others who don’t find the slang for semen amusing. Alas, the hellthread. You had to be there. Basically, too many people responded to one thread, all the people in the thread’s notifications broke, the post became impossible to mute, the thread split off into a bunch of different sub-threads… It was chaos, and the developer who could fix it was off work until Monday — since it was the weekend — and he rightfully stood his ground and took his days off, especially since he had just been working tirelessly to get the block feature working. Oh, the joy of small startup teams! But this meant that the hellthread proliferated for the entire weekend. As prominent shitposter June wrote, “so far in day 3 of the hell thread i’ve seen nudes, a game of tic tac toe, love being found, what can’t the hellthread do.” If you reply to the hellthread, you get trapped in the hellthread — that is, you start getting all the notifications, but you can’t scroll up that far to see the whole hellthread, which makes it sort of confusing, and also, how do you know if you’re in the main hellthread or a sub-thread? It’s easier to conceptualize the hellthread if you imagine it more like a helltree, with roots and branches of varying sizes and strength. To paraphrase Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, every bug that exists long enough becomes a feature. Oh, also, there was a duck bot that kept replying to the hellthread by saying “😔🐥 No 💸, no qwack…” Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while Mastodon can come off as inaccessible: Choosing what instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently simplified its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users. Though Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky and sits on the company’s board, he is not involved in day-to-day development. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site called Happening.

297,More layoff misery could be coming to Salesforce,['@ron_miller'],"March 27, 2023","On Friday, Bloomberg reported that more layoffs could be on the way at Salesforce, quoting chief operating officer Brian Millham, who indicated that the company could be adding to the ongoing job cutting at the CRM leader and in tech in general. If the layoffs happen, it would come on top of the 10% cut in January. “The structure of the organization — if we feel like it needs to change and reshape — we’re going to make those moves to drive the efficiencies,” Milham told Bloomberg. Driving efficiency is corporate speak for cutting more jobs as lower payroll should mean lower operational costs, hence more efficiency. Milham said the company is working with Bain and Company and they are waiting on the management consultants’ advice on how to proceed. The company, which announced an agreement with Elliott Management in which the activist firm has agreed to withdraw its slate of nominees to the company board of directors, has been dogged by four other activists in addition to Elliott. Cost cutting is a big part of what these firms want, and that often comes at the cost of employee job culling. While these types of layoffs are in line with management thinking these days, as we wrote over the weekend, it’s not always clear that they work in the long run, resulting in pain for the people involved, and those left behind, with no clear evidence that layoffs provide long-term financial success. Bob Stuz, a longtime CRM industry executive who had stints at Salesforce, Microsoft and SAP in his long career, said on his No BS with Bob Stutz podcast last week, it’s unbelievable that companies could have gotten to this point. “You don’t turn a profit. Your margins aren’t good. You’re gonna have to let people go. But I still come back to the point of how do you wake up one morning and realize that you have 10,000 more people than what you need or 20,000 more people than what you need or 3,000 more people than what you need. How does that happen? People weren’t doing their jobs at the end of the day. You have to really question the leadership in these companies. What were they doing.” Stutz said on the podcast. He’s not wrong. If these cuts come to pass, Salesforce would join Amazon and Meta, which last week announced a second round of layoffs as the tech layoffs continue unabated. At least 150,000 tech workers have been laid off since the beginning of the year.  "
298,"Parler to be acquired by digital media company Starboard, shut down temporarily",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 14, 2023","Parler, a platform that emerged out of the social media backlash of the Trump era, has been acquired by a new company that plans to temporarily shut it down. Digital media conglomerate Starboard, which recently changed its name from Olympic Media, announced on Friday that it has acquired Parler and plans to temporarily shut it down to launch a revamped version of the social network. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Starboard anticipates that the acquisition will be accretive by the end of the second quarter of 2023. “Parler’s large user base and additional strategic assets represent an enormous opportunity for Starboard to continue to build aggressively in our media and publishing business,” said Starboard CEO Ryan Coyne in a press release. “The team at Parler has built an exceptional audience and we look forward to integrating that audience across all of our existing platforms.” Founded in 2018, Starboard owns conservative-leaning platforms American Wire and BizPac Review. Coyne says the Arlington, Virginia-based company believes advancements in AI and the additions of new features will allow Parler to “begin servicing unsupported online communities.” The announcement comes months after an acquisition agreement between Parler and Kanye West, who no goes by Ye, fell through. Parler’s owner and Ye had “mutually” parted ways without closing the deal, the social network said at the time. Parler rose to popularity in 2021 around the time of the January 6 insurrection, after social media companies like Twitter and Facebook banned former President Donald Trump from their platforms. Many of his supporters flocked to Parler, which had less stringent community guidelines. The social network rose to No. 1 on the App Store days after the insurrection, but had been removed from Google Play on January 8, 2021. Amazon and Apple removed Parler from their platforms shortly after as well. Parler was later reinstated on Apple and Google’s app stores after making changes to its moderation practices. Last September, Parler revealed that it had restructured into Parlement Technologies and acquired a cloud company called Dynascale in order to expand its vision beyond offering a social media app to provide infrastructure for businesses that run the risk of getting the boot from mainstream providers. Parler is one of many platforms, including Gettr and Truth Social, that have cemented themselves as free-speech alternatives to popular social media networks. Another competitor to Parler could be Twitter, which was acquired by Elon Musk last year. Since the acquisition, the social media network has become more lax in its policies, and has also reinstated Trump, though the former president has yet to tweet from the account.  "
299,"Paytm tops $977 million revenue in a year, narrows loss",['@refsrc'],"May 5, 2023","Paytm, India’s leading mobile payments firm, reported a 13.2% surge in revenue to $285.7 million in the quarter ending March and pared its loss by 57% to $20.5 million in a sharp turnaround for the company that is increasingly trying to become profitable following a tremulous year and a half after its public debut. Paytm’s revenue in the financial year ending March 2023 stood at $977.9 million, up from $644.4 million from a year ago. During the period, the firm trimmed its losses to $217 million, down from $293.3 million. The firm attributed surge in its revenue to growth in monetization on payments and broadening of its loan distribution business. “Our contribution margin improved from 30% in FY 2022 to 49% in FY 2023, due to improved payments profitability, and growth in high margin loan distribution business,” the company said in a statement. Paytm said it disbursed loans worth $1.5 billion in Q4 FY 2023 and has served 9.3 million borrowers through its eponymous platform. “During second half of this year, we achieved operational profitability (EBITDA before ESOP) and we believe we can continue our growth momentum and improve our profitability further. We have made significant investments towards sales manpower, improvement of technology platform, marketing spends etc., which will help us carry this momentum.” Paytm, once the poster child of the Indian startup ecosystem, suffered from a poor public debut in 2021. The Noida-headquartered firm, in response, pledged to accelerate its efforts to profitability. The firm, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, is still down 67% from its IPO price of 2,150 Indian rupees ($26.3). In addition to improving its revenue and contribution margin, the firm is also aggressively deepening its product offerings, including primarily its loan offerings, to attract customers. Paytm’s marquee service of mobile payments competes with PhonePe, backed by General Atlantic and Walmart, and Google’s Google Pay. PhonePe, with less than $350 million in revenue, is valued at $12 billion. Paytm ended Friday at a market cap of $5.35 billion. “As we step into the new fiscal year of 2024, we are excited by the long term potential for revenue growth and profitability across payment and lending businesses. The growth of UPI and other mobile payment methods presents a wealth of untapped opportunities,” Paytm said in a press statement following the earnings release."

Welcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.  The big news this week was Ford lifting the hood on how the newly restructured 119-year-old company will operate and, importantly, report its financials. The move provides a new level of transparency into what business sector is — and is not — profitable at Ford. The big takeaway? Profits generated from selling internal combustion engine-powered trucks, cars and SUVs have helped, and will continue to help, drive Ford’s push into EVs. Ford restructured the company and broke it into three segments: Ford Blue for its internal combustion and hybrid vehicles, Ford Pro for the commercial business and Ford Model e, which covers electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems and digital services. Ford restated earnings for 2021 and 2022, which was illuminating to say the least. Ford lost about $3 billion on its Model e business over the past two years and isn’t expected to be profitable (on an adjusted basis that removes costs like taxes) until late 2026 with an 8% operating profit margin. Meanwhile, its commercial and traditional internal combustion engine business units were profitable enough to offset losses incurred by making and selling electric vehicles. A day after revealing its financials and making its case for its restructuring, the company announced that its $5.6 billion BlueOval City complex outside of Memphis, Tennessee will include a truck plant capable of producing 500,000 electric vehicles a year. The first vehicle to come off the line will be a next-gen electric truck, code named Project T3, in 2025. Alrighty, folks let’s get to the rest of the news from this week!

Himiway has three new e-bikes, including an urban commuter, a fat tire off-roader, and a little pedal-less mini e-bike/scooter that only costs $499. Honda is debuting its first e-motorcycles in Japan, possibly this year.  LiveWire by Harley-Davidson is bringing its e-motorcycle to Europe. The LiveWire ONE is available for pre-order in Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK, with shipments starting in April.  New Zealand is considering a proposal that would allow employers to offer staff e-bikes without incurring a fringe tax. A painfully small step in the right direction. I tested out Niu Technology’s KQi3 Max e-scooter to see if I could actually replace my car commute with an e-scooter. The answer is yes, but maybe not with the KQi3, which I found to be powerful and fast, but not sturdy enough for all that torque.  E-bike fires a problem in NYC? A local lawmaker has proposed that delivery workers be allowed to charge their bikes at fire stations rather than apartment buildings to reduce risk of fires. A bill in Oregon would let public schools direct money from their transportation budgets to fund bike buses. Pure Electric just released a new e-scooter with front-facing footboards and a seriously foldable design.  An e-bike that’s lighter than an e-scooter? Only the Swiss can pull something like that off. E-bike maker Thōmus used motor tech from the Mars Rover to build a carbon fiber bike that weighs just over 25 pounds.  Zapp Electric revealed the production version of its limited-edition i300 Carbon Launch Edition. The UK company says it’s like a Vespa and a Ducati had a baby. Customers can take a look, personalize and reserve units with Zapp’s 3D configurator. It costs just under 10,000 euro.  After years of trying, will Turo finally go public? A new regulatory filing suggests the peer-to-peer car rental company might finally make the leap. The company filed an update to its IPO paperwork this past week, detailing its full 2022 financial performance. The upshot? Turo has continued to grind away and even make revenue gains as it awaits better IPO conditions. Turo initially filed confidentially for an IPO back in 2021 and dropped a public S-1 document in early 2022. This latest filing shows Turo generated revenue of $746.6 million, up 59% from the $469 million it brought into the business in 2021. That growth was powered, in part, by a large boost to spending at the company, which saw its sales and marketing costs grow from $52.7 million in 2021 to $111.3 million in 2022. But as TechCrunch editor Alex Wilhelm noted in his article, rising costs didn’t mean that Turo had an unprofitable last year. In fact, after posting GAAP net losses in the $90 million range in both 2019 and 2020, Turo cut the figure to a $40.4 million net loss in 2021. Last year the company’s net income came to a far-shinier and positive $154.7 million, although that number is predicated on a more modest operating income result of $33.8 million. Other deals that got my attention … Amogy Inc., a company developing ammonia fuel used to power trucks and ships, raised $139 million in a Series B-1 round was led by SK Innovation. Other investors include Temasek, Korea Zinc, Aramco Ventures, AP Ventures, MOL PLUS, Yanmar Ventures, Zeon Ventures and DCVC. Bird’s shares jumped 17% this week after the company announced it had received additional funding, bringing the total raised to $33 million this year. The first $30 million, the company had already announced back in January as part of its deal with Bird Canada, so really the company just raised an additional $3 million from “private investors.” At the same time, members of Bird’s board and executive team – including CEO Shane Torchiana, CFO Michael Washinushi, and founder/chair of the board Travis VanderZanden – collectively purchased 1.6 million shares this week worth about $208,000, according to SEC filings. BMW i Ventures co-led an investment in the $16.1M Series A round for startup DeepDrive, a startup that developed an efficient dual-rotor motor that extends the range of electric vehicles. Other investors include UVC Partners, Bayern Kapital with Wachstumsfonds Bayern, and Continental’s Corporate Venture Capital Unit. Candela, the Swedisn-based hydrofoil shuttle company, raised SEK 210 million (around $20 million) in a round co-led by EQT Ventures and investor duo Joel Eklund (Fosielund Holding AB) and Svante Nilo Bengtsson (Marknadspotential AB), with participation from Ocean Zero LLC and others. This follows its $24 million round from last year. Caramel, an LA-based startup that launched a digital car sales platform, raised $12 million in a seed round from lead investors Zeev Ventures, Primera Capital and Hearst Ventures. Kakao Mobility, the ride-hailing subsidiary of South Korean messaging and internet giant Kakao, acquired Splyt, a London startup that works with apps in areas like travel, ride-hailing and finance to help them build out “super app” strategies by integrating other services. Revolv, an electric medium-to-heavy commercial fleet company, raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by an affiliated fund of Greenbacker Capital Management. The U.S. Transportation Department awarded $94.8 million to 59 projects on advanced technology projects to boost road safety, improve transit reliability and use drones and sensors for transportation projects. Virgin Orbit Holdings is reportedly nearing a deal for a $200-million investment from Texas-based venture capital investor Matthew Brown via a private share placement. Wingtra, the drone mapping startup, raised $22 million in Series B funding round from investors DiamondStream Partners, EquityPitcher Ventures, Verve Ventures, the European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), Ace & Company and Spring Mountain Capital founder, John L. Steffens. Zedify, the British e-cargo delivery startup, raised $6.1 million in a round led by Barclays, to expand into Manchester and Birmingham. Zeway, a French startup, raised $29 million to expand its battery swapping network for mopeds.   Remember when news broke earlier that Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, the co-founders of the now-defunct Argo AI, had new startup? There wasn’t much information attached to the story at the time except that it was apparently focused on autonomous vehicle technology and perhaps trucking. Here’s the latest hint at what the former Argo AI co-founders are up to. A website! Now, to be clear, the website I share below is likely NOT the actual name of the startup. And the website is quite scant. The name “Next Self Driving” is a bit cheeky. But I suppose this is the “next” self driving company for Salesky and Rander. There’s nothing obvious that connects the Argo folks to this. It’s hosted on AWS and doesn’t show any internet records or any other artifacts that point to the site’s owner. However, the company posted jobs in Pittsburgh and couple of longtime former Argo employees have listed this website on their LinkedIn page. Have more info? Please share!

301,Cultured meat firm resurrects woolly mammoth in lab-grown meatball,['@psawers'],"March 28, 2023","Truth, as the saying goes, is often stranger than fiction. The very notion of resurrecting the long-extinct woolly mammoth was the stuff of fantasy not that long ago, but scientists are already working on ways to achieve something close to that, using DNA from soft-tissue in frozen mammoth remains and meshing it with that of a modern-day elephant. But while such “de-extinction” projects may or may not ultimately succeed, one company is already laying claim to having produced the first meat product made from mammoth DNA. Vow, an Australian cultivated food company that creates meat in a laboratory setting from animal cells, says that it has used advanced molecular engineering to resurrect the woolly mammoth in meatball form, by combining original mammoth DNA with fragments of an African elephant’s DNA. Mammoth meatball. Image Credits: Aico Lind Mammoth meatball. Image Credits: Aico Lind James Ryall, Vow’s chief science officer, said that the company first identified the mammoth myoglobin, a protein that is key to giving meat its color and taste, and then used publicly available data to identify the DNA sequence in mammoths. “We filled in any gaps in the DNA sequence of this mammoth myoglobin gene by using the genome of the African elephant, the mammoth’s closest living relative [Editor’s note: It’s actually the Asian elephant that is the mammoth’s closest living relative],” Ryall said in a video announcing the mammoth meatball. “We inserted the mammoth myoglobin gene into our cells using a very low-current and high-voltage charge. Then we continued to grow and multiply these cells just as would occur in a mammoth thousands of years ago. And the amazing thing about this is that not a single animal needed to die to produce the mammoth meatball.” There’s little question that cultivated meat is coming, evidenced by the countless companies raising vast swaths of venture capital funding to produce meat and fish in a lab from animal cells, as well as the fact that companies are now starting to receive the blessings of regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But while pork sausages and seafood make sense insofar as they are food that people are familiar with, Vow — which closed a $49.2 million round of funding just a few months ago — is clearly upping the ante with its foray into the world of extinct animals. It’s worth acknowledging that there is a sizeable element of marketing magicianship to this announcement. The very concept was devised by communications agency and WPP-subsidiary Wunderman Thompson, which tells us something about the intent here — this is very much a promotional campaign for Vow. But at the same time, it’s also a promotional campaign for cultured meat in general, and the role it could play in creating a sustainable protein source that doesn’t involve killing animals. By some estimations, around 60% of greenhouse gas emissions from food production emanate from animal-based foods, double that of plant-based equivalents. “The goal behind creating the mammoth meatball was really about starting that discussion around food, and what that decision to eat meat really means to the world at large, by bringing an extinct protein back to life,” Ryall said. This isn’t the first time scientists have created edibles from extinct animals. Back in 2018, a VC-backed Silicon Valley startup called Geltor made gummies using protein from a mastodon, another distant relative of elephants. However, in this latest instance, it’s believed that nobody has actually tasted one of the mammoth meatballs. Speaking to the Guardian newspaper, Professor Ernst Wolvetang, from the Australian Institute for Bioengineering at the University of Queensland which worked with Vow in this project, suggested that it’s probably not safe to try the meatball just now, even if regulators permitted it. “We haven’t seen this protein for thousands of years,” Wolvetang said. “So we have no idea how our immune system would react when we eat it. But if we did it again, we could certainly do it in a way that would make it more palatable to regulatory bodies.” The mammoth meatball is set to be officially unveiled at NEMO Science Museum in the Netherlands today."
302,VCs still think work software is a wise investment,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 11, 2023","Work software is seeing significant investments from VCs, reflecting the continued trend toward digital transformation and remote work. In its Road to Next report released Tuesday, Deloitte found that even though overall investment in work software companies is down from the lofty heights it reached in 2021, the segment still accounted for 15% of total expansion-stage deal value in 2022 (per PitchBook). Venture-growth work software deals remained steady, barely dipping from $35.4 million in 2021 to $35 million in 2022. “As market trends remain relatively dynamic, qualitative data shows the appetite for innovation among workforces is strong,” the Deloitte co-authors wrote. The drivers of the resilience are “numerous,” according to the co-authors, but they highlight a few of the major ones in the report. First, VCs haven’t given up on the idea, right or wrong, that work software can enhance productivity to increase overall return on investment — an attractive prospect during a period of economic malaise. Second, poor macroeconomics — plus destabilizing recent events like the Silicon Valley Bank collapse — have encouraged VCs to turn toward more sustainable “growth trajectories,” which tend to be found among longer-lasting, ironclad business-to-business contracts for software tool suites. There’s truth to that second point. In an IDC poll earlier this year, 62% of corporate tech managers in the U.S. said that tech spending at their companies would be the same or increase compared with 2022. That’s despite the fact that 82% of them said that they expected a recession this year. Gartner presented similar findings in a January forecast. The firm projected that worldwide enterprise spending on software would grow 9.3%, reaching nearly $1 trillion by the end of the year. Tellingly, 2022 saw the most completed work software startup-related rounds in the $5 million to $10 million range in history, according to PitchBook (cited by Deloitte). And the median exit size via acquisition for work software companies in 2022 was $100 million. “Work software providers are revamping their product and service offerings and reorganizing along novel lines that may turn out to be the workplace, workforce, organizational structure and operating models better suited for the future, thus enhancing overall productivity and well-being,” the Deloitte co-authors wrote. But while the overall work software market remains strong, not every category is performing equally well."
303,Device-as-a-service startup Fleet expands beyond laptop leasing,['@romaindillet'],"April 17, 2023","French startup Fleet has been growing nicely over the past four years as the company has deployed nearly 10,000 devices with long-term leasing contracts. The company hasn’t raised any outside funding and is reinvesting as much of its revenue in the company as possible. Originally, Fleet had a very simple product offering. Companies of all sizes could rent a fleet of MacBooks instead of buying them. Instead of spending a lot of money at once, companies could turn these capital expenditures into predictable operating expenditures. The Fleet team has designed the company so that it remains as lean as possible. It doesn’t have any warehouse with huge piles of laptops. It doesn’t have a big credit line with a bank. When a client orders a bunch of laptops, it sends a request to a financial partner based on several criteria so that it can finance those devices. The client signs a contract on Fleet’s website and then the order is processed. “We are connected to the APIs of seven financial partners in France — they represent pretty much the entire market. We have completely automated the process,” Fleet co-founder and CEO Alexandre Berriche told me. Fleet’s pricing is transparent. The company displays on its website how much it’s going to cost to order a specific laptop model. “We price our devices in a way that it takes into account the rates because it depends on the risk of the customer, the size of the orders and also the suppliers,” Berriche said. If a Fleet customer files for bankruptcy, the financial institution is responsible for the credit line. Fleet doesn’t carry any risk in case of a failed payment. But financial companies are willing to work with Fleet because it’s hard to address that market — and very small companies in particular. A company can order a single laptop on Fleet. It works because it’s automated. And because many startups are currently trying to increase their runway, companies can also lease back their devices using Fleet to spread out the cost of their existing equipment over time. In addition to Mac and Windows laptops, Fleet has added other things that you can rent on its platform, such as smartphones, tablets, accessories and even phone booths and furniture. Some of Fleet’s customers are reaching the end of their laptop leases after three years, which means that they’re eligible for refreshes. That’s why the company now has a proper donation program for unused devices. Fleet partners with nonprofits and can redirect old laptops to teams that could still use these computers. Fleet also accepts laptops that weren’t originally issued through its platform. The startup now wants to add new features and services. For instance, Fleet has partnered with Evy to offer insurance products. The company also wants to add mobile device management (MDM) features to locate lost devices and remotely lock them. The idea is that centralizing products like MDM has some value in itself as you don’t need to think about it — you don’t need to compare different services and sign a new contract with yet another company. “I’m really inspired by this U.S. company called Rippling. We have unbundled SaaS products so much that recreating tools that can handle everything from A to Z on a big segment has some value,” Berriche said. “We’re building the operating system for the workplace.”"
304,"As generative AI finds its footing in enterprise products, how will companies charge for its use?",['@alex'],"May 4, 2023","Enterprise software companies aren’t wasting any time integrating generative AI into their products. Despite the relatively recent explosion in interest around large language models built by companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, tech companies big and small are charging into baking the technology into their products and services. You’ve seen the headlines by now: Slack is working on AI tooling; Anthropic is building a version of its own LLM for use inside the corporate chat service; Box is working with generative AI tooling, and so is Ada. And Microsoft’s Bing just ripped the waitlist off its chat product. Corporate excitement for this new system of user-software interaction and user-directed creativity is widespread, and more examples are cropping up. On Wednesday, HubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan told investors during the company’s earnings call that generative AI is going to “rapidly” change the business landscape. Rangan detailed why HubSpot would prove a useful hub for generative AI to accelerate work, arguing that it has “unique data and broad distribution” while residing in the “center of [its] customers’ workflows.”"
305,"Down rounds are a ‘ticket to try again,’ says founder who raised 3 in a row",['@rebecca_szkutak'],"May 5, 2023","For the past year, everyone’s been predicting that the muted exit environment and bone-dry funding market would bring a reckoning for many late-stage companies. We’ve been seeing layoffs and cost-cutting measures across the board as companies look to shore up their balance sheets. And now, an increasing number of companies are raising money at lower valuations than their last investment. Unfortunately for startups, it seems these down rounds are here to stay. Earlier this week, Alex Wilhelm dove into new Q1 data from Carta, which showed that the number of down rounds had nearly quadrupled in Q1 2023 compared to the same time last year. Down rounds carry a negative connotation and are often interpreted as the fault of the company or founder. But in a market where everything seems to be heading downward, they shouldn’t imply a company or its founders made a mistake — you often simply can’t help it. To VCs’ credit, many investors have been vocal over the last year about how companies shouldn’t give in to this stigma. “When you set a $700 million valuation, it looks like you’re winning somehow and you’re not being diluted, but actually, you just raised the bar so high.”
Russ Wilcox, partner, Pillar VC This market cycle hasn’t seen a company raise a down round ahead of a successful exit yet, but startups contemplating that possibility should take heart because companies have overcome this hurdle in the past. Meta, known as Facebook at the time, is probably the best-known example. The social media company had raised a down round in 2009 before it went public in 2012 at a $104 billion valuation. But it might be hard for a B2B sales startup to gain confidence from Meta’s story — the social media company has always seemed to operate in its own world. But there’s one company’s story that might be easier to relate to: E Ink. For those unfamiliar, E Ink was founded in an MIT lab in 1997 and is the company that invented electronic paper, the tech widely used for displays in e-book readers like the Kindle, digital signage, smartwatches and electronic labels."
306,Launch startup Stoke Space rolls out software tool for complex hardware development,['@breadfrom'],"April 4, 2023","Stoke Space, a company that’s developing a fully reusable rocket, has unveiled a new tool to let hardware companies track the design, testing and integration of parts. The new tool, Fusion, is targeting an unsexy but essential aspect of the hardware workflow. It’s a solution born out of “ubiquitous pain in the industry,” Stoke CEO Andy Lapsa said in a recent interview. The current parts-tracking status quo is marked by cumbersome, balkanized solutions built on piles of paperwork and spreadsheets. Many of the existing tools are not optimized “for boots on the ground,” but for finance or procurement teams, or even the C-suite, Lapsa explained. In contrast, Fusion is designed to optimize simple inventory transactions and parts organization, and it will continue to track parts through their lifespan as they are built into larger assemblies and go through testing. To take an extreme example like hardware failures, Fusion will help teams connect anomalous data to the exact serial numbers of the parts involved. Image Credits: Stoke Space Image Credits: Stoke Space “If you think about aerospace in general, there’s a need and a desire to be able to understand the part pedigree of every single part number and serial number that’s in an assembly,” Lapsa said. “So not only do you understand the configuration, you understand the history of all of those parts dating back to forever.” While Lapsa clarified that Fusion is the result of an organic in-house need for better parts management —designing a fully reusable rocket is complicated, after all — turning it into a saleable product was a decision that the Stoke team made early on. It’s a notable example of a rocket startup generating pathways for revenue while their vehicle is still under development. Fusion is particularly relevant to startups. Many existing tools are designed for production runs, not the fast-moving research and development environment that many hardware startups find themselves in, Lapsa added. In these environments, speed and accuracy are paramount. Brent Bradbury, Stoke’s head of software, echoed these comments. “The parts are changing, the people are changing, the processes are changing,” he said. “This lets us capture all that as it happens without a whole lot of extra work.”"
307,Security researcher finds trove of Capita data exposed online,['@carlypage_'],"May 5, 2023","London-based outsourcing giant Capita left a trove of data exposed online for seven years, TechCrunch has learned, just weeks after the company admitted to a data breach potentially impacting customer data.  Requesting anonymity, a security researcher alerted TechCrunch to an unprotected Amazon-hosted storage bucket, which was secured by Capita last week.  The AWS bucket, which the researcher said had been exposed to the internet since 2016, contained approximately 3,000 files totaling 655GB in size. There was no password on the bucket, allowing anyone who knew the easy-to-guess web address access to the files. Details of the exposed cloud server were also captured by GrayHatWarfare, a searchable database that indexes publicly visible cloud storage. The exposed data included software files, server images, numerous Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations and text files, according to a sample of filenames reviewed by TechCrunch. One of the text files contained login details for one of Capita’s systems, the security researcher told TechCrunch, and some filenames that suggested data was being uploaded to the exposed bucket as recently as this year. It’s not clear whether data belonging to Capita customers, a list which includes the U.K.’s National Health Service and the Department for Work and Pensions, was contained within these files. “I’m going to guess some of this stuff is not supposed to be available to the internet, given they closed the bucket since,” the security researcher told TechCrunch. Capita was alerted to the data breach in late-April and secured the bucket that same week. The security researcher, who notified Capita of the breach, told TechCrunch that while the exposed bucket was promptly closed, the company doesn’t have a responsible disclosure program or a dedicated security contact.  Capita spokesperson Elizabeth Lee told TechCrunch in a statement that the unsecured bucket contained  “information such as release notes and user guides, which are routinely published alongside software releases in line with standard industry practice.” She declined to answer additional questions. The researcher said he believes this incident is unrelated to the late-March Capita cyberattack claimed by the Black Basta ransomware group. The scope of this incident remains unknown, though Capita admitted last month that it had seen evidence of “limited data exfiltration” which “might include customer, supplier or colleague data.” Samples of the leaked data, seen by TechCrunch, included bank account details, passport photos and driver’s licenses, and the personal data of teachers applying for jobs at schools. Capita has also told trustees that some data related to pensions is “likely to have been exfiltrated,” according to the Financial Times.  These files have not been shared publicly by Black Basta. It’s not known whether a ransom demand was paid.  Updated with comment from Capita.   "
308,"Now valued at $500M, Cosmose ditches Stripe to adopt Near’s crypto solution",['@ritacyliao'],"April 24, 2023","For all the investment speculation and hype, cryptocurrency has so far struggled to find meaningful use cases. Now there’s some effort from Singapore to turn the general public into crypto adopters through blockchain payments. Cosmose AI, a nine-year-old company that uses AI analytics to track in-store foot traffic and engage with shoppers online, is partnering with Near, one of the blockchain protocols competing with Ethereum. The pair are building a payment system that allows users to shop with crypto at low transaction fees, saving money for both buyers and sellers. As part of the partnership, Near Foundation, the nonprofit arm of Near supporting the protocol’s ecosystem development, has made a strategic investment in Cosmose. The round, of which the amount is undisclosed, lifts the company’s valuation to $500 million, up from $100 million when it closed its $15 million Series A financing in 2020. Cosmose’s suite of retail solutions includes the KaiKai app that lets customers discover retail stores in their physical vicinity and an online targeting platform, both of which are getting a blockchain makeover with Near’s help. Miron Mironiuk, the company’s founder and CEO, didn’t intend to ride the crypto wave; rather, he was seeking a solution that would make online payments cheaper for consumers and vendors Cosmose served. “I’m not sure if you know how expensive and slow it is to process online payments. It’s absolutely crazy,” Mironiuk told TechCrunch in an interview. He gave the example of buying a $5 cup of coffee. Payments processing companies like Stripe and PayPal charge effectively over 10% for small transactions, so the seller ends up increasing prices, forcing the buyer to pay 6-10% more. In a year, the coffee drinker could easily be spending an extra $200 just because the transactions are handled by intermediaries like Stripe. With its Near-powered blockchain payment system, KaiKai, where users can discover nearby products and pay via the app, claims to reduce the transaction costs of one’s annual coffee consumption to just $4, which is 50 times less than the Stripe or PayPal method, according to Mironiuk. “Imagine how much you could save if all payments are moved to blockchain,” said the founder. Not all blockchains are cheap to use. One of the biggest challenges facing crypto adoption is the exorbitant fees involved. Without a centralized settlement system, cryptocurrencies rely on a distributed network of validators to verify on-chain transactions. That process on Ethereum is notoriously expensive, so alternatives like Cardano, Pokadot and Near have emerged to make crypto cheaper and more scalable. Cosmose’s team across Warsaw, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Paris. Image Credits: Cosmose AI Cosmose’s team across Warsaw, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Paris. Image Credits: Cosmose AI Cosmose’s shopping discovery app KaiKai settles payments in its native stablecoin Kai-Ching, which runs on Near’s network. The app creates a crypto wallet for users, who can top up Kai-Ching with fiat currencies. In the future, users might have the option to convert Kai-Ching back into fiat. Cosmose keeps a treasury for Kai-Ching, which is pegged to U.S. dollars (1 Kai-Ching = 1 USD cent) and only tradable within the app to prevent value volatility. KaiKai first launched the option to pay with crypto in Singapore last September, where the government is in the process of formulating a stablecoin regulation. Since then, Kai-Ching has processed over 1 million transactions in the form of payments, refunds and rewards. Prices are automatically lowered when users opt to pay in Kai-Ching. Over half of Ka-Ching’s users are Gen Z, and they are “super comfortable” with crypto because they know “the coins are on-chain” and “they own it,” the founder observed. The company declined to disclose how many crypto users it has accumulated, but one data point shines a light on its user behavior: One-third of the transactions are paid with Kai-Ching. Given the traction in Singapore, it won’t be surprising if Cosmose is taking Kai-Ching to other crypto-friendly jurisdictions in the future. Cosmose and Near are onto something that seems even more ambitious. One of the promises of blockchain-based applications is to return the control over personal data back to users rather than keeping it with Big Tech’s centralized servers. Essentially, Near is helping Cosmose migrate user data onto its blockchain and building out a system where users can see how the firm is tracking them, including their location, when they open the app, the products they browse and how long they stay. The goal is to store user data on their phones using edge computing and let people decide how they want to be tracked to receive more or less precise product recommendations and rewards. “It’s not only a technical challenge. It’s also a user experience challenge of how to do it in a way that people actually can check it and get some insights and decide quickly,” the founder said. Since its inception, Cosmose has served over 20 million stores and reached one billion phones worldwide, with China accounting for “hundreds of millions” of them. The company has a team of 80 staff across Warsaw, its engineering base, as well as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Paris.               "
309,"Cruise recalls 300 robotaxis, issues software update after crashing into city bus",['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 7, 2023","GM’s self-driving unit Cruise filed with federal regulators a voluntary recall to update the software in 300 robotaxis after one struck the back of a city bus in San Francisco. Cruise said in a report with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration that it initiated the recall because in rare circumstances the software could inaccurately predict the movement of “articulated” vehicles. There were no reported injuries in the low-speed crash on March 23, in which a Cruise robotaxi rear-ended an articulated San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority bus. The Cruise self-driving software failed to accurately predict the movement of the bus and struck the back after braking too late. Cruise said the incident resulted in minor damage to the front fender of the AV and caused no injuries. “Fender benders like this rarely happen to our AVs, but this incident was unique,” Cruise co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt wrote in a blog posted Friday. “We do not expect our vehicles to run into the back of a city bus under any conditions, so even a single incident like this was worthy of immediate and careful study.” Vogt went on to explain how Cruise engineers responded to the crash and provided some detail on its investigation. The company updated the software March 25 and has said the issue has been corrected. Last September, Cruise reported a software recall and update in 80 of its robotaxis following a crash in June. The crash, which resulted in minor injuries to two riders, received national attention because it occurred a day after Cruise received the final permit from California regulators to commercialize its driverless robotaxi service. Cruise said in the regulatory filing that the software recall was issued because of a “rare circumstance” in which the automated driving system caused the driverless robotaxi — which did not have a human safety driver behind the wheel — to hard brake while making an unprotected left turn."
310,"Mozilla buys Fakespot, a startup that identifies fake reviews, to bring shopping tools to Firefox",['@aiishamalik1'],"May 2, 2023","Mozilla announced today that it has acquired Fakespot, a startup that offers a website and browser extension that helps users identify fake or unreliable reviews. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Fakespot’s offerings can be used to spot fake reviews listed on various online marketplaces including Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor and more. Founded in 2016, New York-based Fakespot uses an AI and machine learning system to detect patterns and similarities between reviews in order to flag those that are most likely to be deceptive. Fakespot provides a rating or grade for the product’s reviews in order to help consumers make more informed decisions when making a purchase. The goal behind the company’s website and browser extension is to give users the ability to quickly see where deceptive reviews may be artificially inflating a product’s ranking in search engines. “Fakespot will continue to work across all major web browsers and mobile devices, and the Mozilla team will be investing in continuing to enhance the Fakespot experience for its many, dedicated users,” said Mozilla Chief Product Officer Steve Teixeira in a blog post. “There will also be future Fakespot integrations that are unique to Firefox. The addition of Fakespot’s capabilities will make Firefox customers the best equipped to cut through deceptive reviews and shop with the confidence of knowing what they’re buying is high-quality and authentic.” Mozilla says that with Fakespot, Firefox users will have access to a trustworthy shopping tool that will help improve the e-commerce experience. The company says it will introduce Fakespot functionality to Firefox over time. Although AI and machine learning have long been used to detect fake reviews, the task is likely only to get more difficult with the introduction of enhanced and commercially available AI tools. For instance, recent reports indicate that people are using AI chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, to write reviews for products on Amazon. These reviews that are reportedly written by ChatGPT could be the next iteration of scam and fake reviews. Today’s announcement comes a few weeks after Mozilla launched an AI-focused startup called Mozilla.ai. The newly forged company’s mission isn’t to build just any AI — its mission is to build AI that’s open source and “trustworthy,” according to Mark Surman, the executive president of Mozilla and the head of Mozilla.ai.

311,Blinded by the speed of change,['@ron_miller'],"March 26, 2023","My grandfather lived through an incredible period of technological change. He saw the invention of the automobile, the airplane and the rocket. He lived through the dawn of the atomic age and the mainframe computer. He didn’t live long enough to see the PC or the impact it would have on my professional life, but he was around for the creation of a lot of the technology that laid the foundation for what’s happening today. I’ve been at this for a long time myself. I remember working on an early IBM PC. Later, I accessed the text-based internet via a 300-baud modem. I can recall the earliest days of the World Wide Web. My first cell phone was a Motorola brick phone. My first iPhone was the 3. Bottom line is I’ve seen a lot of technological change, and I’ve never seen anything like we’re seeing these past months, weeks and days. Consider for a moment that ChatGPT 3.5 took the world by storm in December. Last week, while I was on vacation, OpenAI released ChatGPT 4, which OpenAI unabashedly called “state of the art.” This week, we saw the announcement of plug-ins for the internet itself and useful tools like Expedia, WolframAlpha and so many others, suddenly accelerating generative AI in new and exciting directions. All of this is happening with stunning speed. It feels like we’re living through an inflection point, much like we saw with the first IBM PC, the internet, the web, the iPhone. But this moment of change is happening so fast, we’ve barely got time to process the latest twist before the next iteration comes flying down the chute. Like those moments we saw with the advent of personal computing, connected computing and mobile computing, you know that something huge is happening, but it’s not clear yet what it will become. At the moment, we know that there is an exciting new technology that can change the way we interact with computers, but we aren’t clear yet how that will play out, any more than we knew how the web or smartphones would transform our lives in ways we really couldn’t imagine in the earliest days. On a panel last week led by Docker CEO Scott Johnston, Ilan Rabinovich, SVP of product and community at Datadog, talked about the similarities between what we’re seeing now and the early days of the internet."
312,Discover the SaaS Stage at Disrupt 2023,['@fredericl'],"April 6, 2023","TechCrunch Disrupt, the premier event for startup investors and founders, is coming back September 19–21, 2023 — and we’ve mixed up the format. This year, we’re rethinking TC Sessions, the stand-alone industry events series, and merging them into the big annual tech event — which will once again be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Disrupt will have six industry tracks, each with its own stage, including AI, fintech, hardware, SaaS, security and climate. On the SaaS stage, we’ll feature fireside chats and panels with some of the biggest names in the industry (and we’ll announce the first round of speakers soon). While the term “software as a service” has been around for almost 20 years, the SaaS industry is now changing faster than it ever has, and the number of startups joining the fray is seemingly growing every year. The concept has changed the way consumers and — maybe even more importantly — businesses interact with their software tools and customers. It gave rise to the idea of continuous integration and delivery, now that you don’t have to ship shrink-wrap boxes with updates. And (in the context of a startup conference) it fundamentally changed how businesses think about acquiring customers, with today’s focus being squarely on product-led growth. At Disrupt, we will look at the current state of the industry, but most important, we’ll look toward what’s next. We’ll talk about what it takes to build a successful SaaS startup in 2023 and how to get funding, for example. We’ll also look at how you can build AI tools into your SaaS product, how some of the larger players think about acquisitions in the current financial climate and — thinking ahead — how quantum computing startups will be able to leverage SaaS for their platforms. Want to lead a SaaS roundtable or breakout session at Disrupt? Put your hat in the ring here and apply to be a speaker. Applications close April 21.

elcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. I spent quite a bit of time lately looking at the latest in insurtech. What’s great about zooming in on a sector is that I hear things that I didn’t expect. Talking to investors has also helped me confirm some of my intuition on topics like cash diversification and M&As. — Anna When I reached out to investors recently for our latest insurtech survey, I was curious to know how the economy was affecting insurance purchase decisions and whether this made B2B companies more appealing to VCs than their B2C peers. My reasoning was that inflation could be weighing so heavily on family budgets that they may decide to cut down spending on expenses such as insurance. Perhaps not the best call, but if it’s either food or better insurance, the choice becomes easier. While businesses have also been looking to cut costs, they are less likely to forgo insurance, especially for the risks they are more exposed to. For insurtech startups, this would create an environment in which it is easier to sell B2B products than B2C ones. But is it actually the case? As usual, it turns out that the answer is more complicated than a simple yes or no — but also more interesting.   "
314,"Founded by Adyen and Affirm alums, Ansa aims to help merchants create virtual wallets for customers",['@bayareawriter'],"April 26, 2023","Having the ability to load up a digital wallet to pay for goods and services at businesses you frequent, and then earn rewards for those purchases, would be convenient and well, rewarding. But as of now, few merchants outside of retail giants such as Starbucks offer that ability. Ansa is a startup emerging from stealth today that wants to change that. Founded last year by former Adyen product manager Sophia Goldberg and ex-Affirm software engineer JT Cho, San Francisco-based Ansa is building what it describes as a white-labeled digital wallet infrastructure to help businesses process small payments and offset high credit card fees for smaller transactions. Or as Goldberg describes it, Ansa is building a “wallet-as-a-service,” or embedded customer balances to let any merchant launch a branded flexible payment instrument. “That can look like the Starbucks in-app payment experience where a customer loads funds, it can also allow a merchant to fund with incentives or refunds,” she told TechCrunch. “The why of this is that it can really reduce costs, increase revenue and drive loyalty.” Initial customers are quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and coffee shops, but the founders’ goal one day is to serve enterprise customers as well. Goldberg, who penned “The Field Guide to Global Payments” and was previously on Hillary Clinton’s finance team during her campaign, said she was driven to build Ansa in part because of what she described as “inflexibility in payments in the U.S. today.” “Especially during the pandemic heyday of the creator economy, I saw some companies launching not great monetization experiences, and I thought you know for these small transactions, it should be a closed loop wallet on your platform, then you’re able to get away from barriers to entry with card cost of payments today,” she said. “Your most loyal customers shouldn’t cost you the most.” So how does offering prepayments help save money for merchants? Besides paying interchange fees for any credit or debit card purchase, merchants also pay other fees for every transaction. Card fees, particularly for micropayments, can represent well over 12.5% of the transaction, notes Goldberg. But if a consumer prepays, they’re making fewer transactions overall. This means that a merchant then pays lower fees on the transactions being made by what Goldberg calls “habitual use, low transaction” (or HULT) customers. Ansa claims that by using its API-first platform, a merchant can create a wallet “within weeks rather than quarters.” It’s live with its first pilot customers and plans to charge customers a monthly recurring fee. Bain Capital Ventures led Ansa’s $5.4 million seed round last year and notably, partner Christina Melas-Kyriazi actually introduced Goldberg to Cho, who had moved on from Affirm to Google. “Sophia and JT are fintech veterans with a similar mindset around product and culture,” Melas-Kyriazi told TechCrunch. “Having worked with JT at Affirm, I knew he would be an ideal technical partner for Sophia’s product-minded payments experience.” She added: “It’s completely counterintuitive that the most frequent customers at many small businesses are also the least profitable. Sophia’s expertise in payments and deep knowledge of the customer’s pain points make her the ideal founder for a company dedicated to making it easier to attract, retain and reward those loyal customers profitably. Ansa will bring the virtual wallets used by the Starbucks of the world to every local coffee shop and quick service restaurant.” Ansa’s other backers are a mix of institutions and angel investors: Nimi Katragadda at BoxGroup, Nichole Wischoff at Wischoff Ventures, Cambrian Ventures, the Fintech Fund, Susa Ventures and angels such as Plaid co-founder and CEO Zach Perret, Gokul Rajaram and the founders of Alloy, among others.

315,The crackdown on pixel tracking in telehealth is a warning for every startup,['@carlypage_'],"April 17, 2023","Healthcare startups are scrambling to reassess how their websites and apps are built, and how third parties may, inadvertently or not, be putting patients’ protected health information at risk. In March, U.S. mental health startup Cerebral admitted it shared the private health information of more than 3 million users with Facebook, Google, TikTok and other ad giants via so-called tracking pixels. These near-invisible bits of code are typically embedded in web pages to share information about users’ activity, often for analytics. Cerebral said these trackers inadvertently collected sensitive user data since it began operating in October 2019. In its disclosure to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Cerebral said that following a review of its code, it “determined that it had disclosed certain information that may be regulated as protected health information under [the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act],” or HIPAA, as it’s commonly referred to. This information included patients’ phone numbers, IP addresses, insurance information, mental health assessment responses and associated clinical data. This data lapse is the third-largest breach of health data in 2023, according to the HHS, which is investigating the breach. However, while Cerebral’s lapse ranks among the most serious and damaging, the breach is just one of many currently being investigated by HHS — and this list is likely to grow. Last year, a joint investigation by STAT and The Markup found that dozens of hospital websites and telehealth startups were sharing patients’ medical information with advertisers and tech giants."
316,Gen Phoenix’s upcycled leather woos luxury brand investors,['@harriblogs'],"April 4, 2023"," The materials developer formerly known as ELeather has a new name and $18 million in fresh growth funding from some of the world’s fanciest brands. Now going by Generation Phoenix, the upcycler says its new investors include Coach parent Tapestry, Jaguar Land Rover (via InMotion Ventures) and Dr. Martens, plus lead investor Material Impact and prior investor Hermès. The 15-year-old firm is based in Peterborough, U.K., and has worked with brands such as Nike and Delta. The upcycler intends to use the new cash to expand “into the luxury fashion and footwear categories,” Gen Phoenix said in a statement. The company claims it has diverted more than 8,000 tons of leather waste from landfills to date. “Imagine what can happen when waste is no longer wasted,” Gen Phoenix says in an aspirational message on its new website. The upcycler tells TechCrunch that its “feedstock comes directly from tanneries where about 1/3 of a leather hide is typically discarded.” Turning the leather waste into a usable, leather-like product involves shredding and “entangling” it “around a high-performance core using nothing but high pressure water,” the firm said. Gen Phoenix’s “recycled leather” is not entirely made of recycled materials. A spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch that its products feature “up to 86% recycled content,” including recycled leather and recycled plastic. Still, the firm’s final product also contains virgin plastic. Gen Phoenix founder and CEO John Kennedy explaining the company’s leather-like product. Image Credits: Gen Phoenix Without sharing a specific deadline, a spokesperson for Gen Phoenix said the company aims to “reduce and eliminate virgin materials from their products completely.” The upcycler is also “commercialising a bio-based coating system and bio-based substitutions for any synthetic materials used in the process,” the spokesperson added. Hopefully, we’ll soon see Gen Phoenix kick virgin materials altogether. Zooming out: Gen Phoenix’s inclusion of plastics is hardly unusual, even for “sustainable” brands. Fossil fuel–based materials permeate the fashion business. Polyester? Nylon? Elastane? All plastic. Even the rise of recycled plastic fabrics warrants deep skepticism; the resulting synthetic clothing is rarely recycled, and the microplastics they shed go basically everywhere, including the ocean, mountaintops, the insides of sea critters and even our own bodies. Addressing the industry’s climate and broader environmental toll demands rethinking everything, from how we dye fabrics to killing “fast fashion” altogether. "

To start, the platform is rolling out a new “Cosmic Lens” that turns you and your surroundings into an immersive, animated sci-fi scene. “Today, we’re introducing a new generation of Lenses powered by generative AI,” Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said during the event. “AI and AR are deeply interconnected, powering a new spectrum of creative possibilities. Our vision is to weave computing seamlessly into the world — and support our vibrant community of AR creators, developers and partners.” Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat It’s not surprising that Snapchat is veering into the world of generative AI to enhance its AR Lenses, especially since it already got in on the AI frenzy with its My AI chatbot. It’s worth noting that Snapchat isn’t the only popular social media platform to use AI to enhance its AR offerings, as TikTok recently stunned viewers with its hyper-realistic AI-powered “Bold Glamour” filter. In addition to launching generative AI Lenses, Snapchat announced that it’s making it easier for users to find relevant Lenses. The app will start recommending Lenses that fit with the context of a photo or video a user has captured. Snapchat explained that this will be done through a combination of visual understanding of what’s in the camera’s view and APIs that understand specific factors, such as the local weather, forecast and time of day. Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat The company has also rolled out improvements to its Lens Carousel ranking algorithms to recommend Lenses based on users’ unique preferences and updated the AR Bar, which means users will find hundreds of suggested Lenses organized by category, right on the Camera screen. Snapchat is also testing ways to make it faster to add AR to Memories. Users start to see their recent shots alongside Lenses in the Snapchat Camera, so that they can easily access them when they’re about to post a throwback Snap. As part of the announcements, Snapchat revealed that more than 300,000 AR creators and developers around the world have built over 3 million Lenses. In addition, the company shared that some of its most popular Lenses have been viewed more than 10 billion times. At today’s event, Snap made a series of announcements and unveiled a slew of new features coming to the app. The company is rolling out new Stories features, adding updates to the Snap Map, enhancing Bitmoji, introducing new ways to virtually interact with friends and more.

320,Google Cloud’s AlloyDB Omni lets you run its PostgreSQL-compatible database anywhere,['@fredericl'],"March 29, 2023","AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is Google Cloud’s fully managed cloud-based database service. And typically, that’s where the story ends with these born-in-the-cloud services. But Google Cloud is taking a somewhat unusual approach with AlloyDB. Today, the company is launching AlloyDB Omni, a downloadable edition of AlloyDB that its users can install on premises, at the edge or on their laptops. There will be a free developer edition, while commercial users will have to pay for their licenses. Google argues that AlloyDB Omni, which the company will package as a downloadable container, is twice as fast for transactional workloads and can deliver 100 times faster analytical queries than the standard open source version of PostgreSQL. Google also notes that AlloyDB Omni can scale to a much larger number of CPUs. “When we announced AlloyDB, we talked a lot about the fact that many customers had approached us and talked about their interest in getting off legacy databases and moving to open APIs, whether those are customers coming from Oracle, [Microsoft’s] SQL Server, [IBM’s] Db2, Google’s Andi Gutmans explained. “And part of the mission of AlloyDB was really to help customers modernize their existing legacy databases, onto open APIs, while the focus of our AlloyDB managed service was to bridge some of those gaps between the higher-end legacy database environments that customers are running on premises and what they could get from open source.” Gutmans noted that Google was getting a lot of interest from customers who wanted to move to AlloyDB, but quite a few also noted that it would take them quite a bit of time to move all of their workloads to the cloud — and their strategies typically revolved around a multicloud approach. And these customers, Gutmans said, want to move away from their legacy databases faster than they can move to the cloud. Unsurprisingly, the result of this is AlloyDB Omni, which will now allow Google’s customers to modernize their workloads. “While the cloud is often the final destination, many organizations have workloads that can’t be immediately moved, creating the need for a downloadable, cross-platform database to run enterprise applications,” said Carl Olofson, research vice president, Data Management Software, IDC. “AlloyDB Omni is a great move for Google Cloud because it meets customers where they are rather than requiring them to change platforms. A PostgreSQL-compatible database with accelerated performance, an integrated analytics engine and ML-driven management fills a critical need in the database market, and AlloyDB Omni is a compelling option for organizations looking for a proven database that’s supported by a major vendor and offers cloud and non-cloud deployment options.” Given that AlloyDB is essentially a drop-in replacement for PostgreSQL, businesses can use all of the PostgreSQL-compatible tools they may already use today to back up and replicate their databases, for example, and the service is obviously compatible with all PostgreSQL-enabled applications they may already have. Google says that it will offer full enterprise support, including 24/7 technical support, once AlloyDB Omni becomes generally available. Asked about whether Google Cloud would contribute some of this work back to the open source PostgreSQL project, Gutmans noted that the company plans to be an active contributor to the project, but that it will keep some of its work private as well. “There are certain areas where we believe we have some secret sauce and differentiation that’s important for us to keep,” he said. “I’ll give you an example: Our vectorized engine that helps accelerate analytics queries, that is based on many years of innovation inside of Google and work that we already did before AlloyDB. That’s probably something that we were more likely to kind of keep in the AlloyDB product. But there’s definitely areas where we think we can become more significant contributors to Postgres and really help to make sure that we both give back and really make the Postgres community better.”"
321,"India warns e-commerce giants, urges adoption of open network",['@refsrc'],"April 25, 2023","India will use the “full force of the government” to promote the adoption of its open e-commerce network, cautioning e-commerce giants failing to join the initiative within the stipulated time frame may result in withdrawal of the offer. The commerce minister of India Piyush Goyal reiterated his appeal to the e-commerce giants to join the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and warned that at some stage “we will also have to cut off those who are left behind.” ONDC is an Indian government-backed initiative that strives to democratize the e-commerce landscape by offering a zero-commission platform. Several players from the industry, including PhonePe and Paytm, have joined the interoperable network that allows buyers and sellers to do business regardless of the service they use. Flipkart and Amazon India, the leading duo in the South Asian e-commerce arena, have thus far exhibited reticence in their engagement with the network. “ONDC doesn’t threaten nobody. Even big commerce is not threatened by ONDC. It only opens the door to opportunities in more inclusive fashion for more people and businesses. I will encourage all e-commerce companies to join ONDC and join on time so that you’re not too late to join the train,” Goyal said. Goyal also urged firms to use their marquee apps to join ONDC instead of launching new offerings. “I would tell Koshy (the chief executive of ONDC) to exclude those e-commerce platforms which are not coming to the network with their main platforms. Some are building ONDC-specific platforms. That’s not our aim,” said Goyal. “If you do that, while you are taking the benefit of ONDC by availing of the sellers, but you are not giving your consumer base the benefit of choice of buying from any of the sellers.” Monolithic technology platforms will never be able to offer the kind of opportunities and competition that a network of platforms like ONDC can, Goyal said. “Instead of a siloed approach, where a winner takes it all, the humble effort of ONDC is to offer greater degree of discoverability, so that a consumer can discover more options, can discover better pricing and quality and similarly a seller will be able to discover more buyers across the country, maybe even in their neighborhood and then across the world.”"
322,Meta opens up its social VR space Horizon Worlds to teens,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 18, 2023","Meta announced today that it’s opening up Horizon Worlds to teen users in the U.S. and Canada, after previously restricting the social VR platform to users 18 years of age and above. As part of the expansion, the company says it’s introducing a set of age-appropriate protections and safety defaults. The move comes as lawmakers and children’s rights activists had urged Meta to abandon its plans to open up the platform to young users. Today’s announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as a leaked memo revealed back in February that Meta planned to open up access to Horizon Worlds to users aged 13 to 17. At the time, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg urging him to halt the plans, arguing that giving teens access to “digital space rife with potential harms” would be a bad idea. Meta says it has invested in new safety features including back-end protections and parental supervision tools that allow parents and teens to help manage the experience before making Worlds available to this age group. The company says it’s rolling out Horizon Worlds to teens slowly so that it can carefully examine usage before expanding more broadly. Teens can choose who they follow and who can follow them back, and their profiles are automatically set to private, which means they can approve or decline anyone who requests to follow them. By default, Meta also won’t show a teen’s active status and their Horizon Worlds location to other people, but these settings can be changed, as teens can choose whether their connections can see if they’re active online and which public world or event they’re in. “We use content ratings to ensure teens have an age-appropriate experience within Worlds,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “For example, mature world and event ratings prevent teens from finding, seeing, or entering spaces that contain mature content. Our policies prohibit teens from publishing mature worlds or events. Worlds violating this policy will be removed.” Meta will also transform the voices of people a teen doesn’t know into garbled sounds. The teens voice will be garbled too, so people they don’t know can’t hear them. In addition, Meta says it will limit interaction between teens and adults by not displaying any adults a teen doesn’t know in their “people you might know” list. As for parents, they will be able to set up Worlds parental supervision by inviting their teen to connect though Meta’s Family Center offering. Once this is set up, parents will be able to see, adjust and lock safety features. Parents will also be able to see who their teen follows and who follows their teen. The controls allow parents to see how much time teens have spent in Worlds and also block their teens from using Worlds altogether. In days leading up the announcement, many children’s rights activists had asked Meta to abandon its plans to attract young teens onto the social VR platform, worrying that doing so would expose them to sexually explicit and homophobic content. Meta has had problems both with keeping users protected while using the platform. After its initial rollout, some users reported being groped and sexually harassed in Horizon Worlds. To address this, Meta later rolled out a “personal boundary” feature. Much of the platform can feel like a free-for-all since it can be difficult to moderate speech-based interactions on a massive scale. It’s worth noting that although Horizon Worlds technically was restricted to adults prior to this expansion, many people reported that the platform was overrun with young users who were able to easily bypass the age limit for the platform.

Tesla has repeatedly reduced the price of its four EVs — the Model S, Model X, Model Y and Model 3 — in the United States as well as Europe and China. That strategy has helped boost sales with revenue in the first quarter reaching $23.3 billion, a 24% pop from the same period last year. But it has also squeezed the automaker’s traditionally robust automotive gross margins. At the same time, Tesla’s operating expenses have remained mostly flat (falling just 1% from Q1 in 2022) and its capital expenditures have increased. The company reported that it spent $2 billion in capital expenditures in the first quarter, a 17% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, its operating margin — one measure of profitability and an area where Tesla has been an industry leader — fell from 19.2% in the first quarter of 2022 to 11.4 in this period. Tesla shares fell 4% in after-hours trading. Tesla continues to generate most of its revenue from the sale of EVs, although there is some growth in other areas like energy storage and solar. In the first quarter, Tesla’s automotive revenue — a figure that includes $521 million in zero emissions tax credits — hit nearly $19.9 billion, an 18% increase YoY. That regulatory credits number is up from the last three quarters, but down from Q1 2022. Tesla closed out the quarter with free cash flow of $441 million, which is down 80% from the same period last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed the company’s Master Plan Part 3 at the company’s annual Investor Day in March 2023. Much of the plan was focused on how Tesla would drive the global shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy, and the automaker’s energy storage and generation business is a big part of that plan. In the first quarter, revenue from that side of the business hit a record $1.5 billion, an increase of 148% from the same quarter last year. Tesla said it is rapidly growing its energy storage production capacity at its Megafactory in Lathrop, California. The company also recently announced a new Megafactory in Shanghai that will have 40 GWh of capacity. Construction is scheduled for later this year. Tesla’s deployments for energy storage also increased significantly YoY, up 360% to 3.9 GWh, which the company says is the highest level of deployments due to the Megafactory ramp. In the solar department, deployments increased 40% from Q1 2022, but declined quarter-over-quarter. Tesla says this is due to volatile weather, as well as supply chain challenges. Tesla repeatedly noted that it plans to increase revenue from software-related services. “While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied with an acceleration of software-related profits,” the company said in its Q1 letter to shareholders. ” We continue to believe that our operating margin will remain among the highest in the industry.” Tesla doesn’t break out the revenue it makes from its advanced driver assistance system. The company’s ADAS known as Autopilot is standard on all of its vehicles. However, it generates revenue through two optional upgrades: a product called Enhanced Autopilot for $6,000 or its so-called Full Self-Driving system for $15,000. Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD are not self-driving. The company said during its Q4 earnings call that around 400,000 cars in the U.S. and Canada have its FSD software. Tesla has changed the price of FSD over the years, but its most current iteration is currently $15,000 in North America. FSD is beta software that was first made available to specific owners and then slowly rolled out to others who had purchased the product. In the first quarter, Tesla recalled the majority of vehicles with FSD onboard due to safety issues. The automaker then released the latest version of FSD Beta, which combines highway driving and city driving into one software stack. As a result of the wide reach and capabilities of the system, Tesla is able to continuously collect millions of miles of data to continue to train its models. Tesla reported over 150 million miles driven to date, and counting. Tesla said Wednesday its guidance for 2023 remains the same. The company expects to remain ahead of its long-term 50% compound annual growth rate with around 1.8 million cars for the year. Earlier this month, Tesla reported it delivered 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter."
324,Watch SpaceX try to fly a fully stacked Starship for the first time,['@breadfrom'],"April 17, 2023","In a few short hours, SpaceX will attempt to fly its fully integrated Starship launch system for the first time from the company’s massive base on Texas’s southeastern coast. While SpaceX has conducted a number of suborbital tests of the Starship upper stage from its base in Texas, this will be the first time that a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy booster will fly together. The reusable launch system, which is the most powerful rocket ever built, is designed to carry an enormous amount of mass to orbit, the moon and even to Mars. Starship, which stands at nearly 394 feet, will use 33 Raptor engines to generate 16.7 million pounds of thrust at lift-off. The entire test flight will last around 90 minutes, with both the booster and the upper stage falling back to Earth in an ocean splashdown. SpaceX is not planning on recovering either stage. SpaceX has already amassed billions in contracts for the Starship system, and a number of private human spaceflight missions. Chief amongst these is NASA’s $2.9 billion Human Landing System contract, which will see Starship retooled to land humans on the moon. Initiatives like dearMOON, headed by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, will also use Starship to send a crew of nine on a lunar mission. The launch window opens at 8:00 AM EST and will run for 150 minutes. If SpaceX has to scrub the launch, they’ll have backup opportunities throughout the week and weekend. As SpaceX CEO Elon Musk put it in a tweet about the flight test in February: “Success is far from certain, but excitement is guaranteed!”"
325,Kenyan court paves way for lawsuit alleging Facebook played role in fueling Ethiopia’s Tigray conflict,['@annienjanja'],"April 28, 2023","Ethiopians suing Meta for failing to adequately moderate content that amplified violence that left over half-a-million people dead during the Tigray War have been granted the go-ahead to serve the social media giant outside Kenya. This is the latest case that seeks to compel Facebook to stop amplifying violent, hateful and inciteful posts. A Kenyan court on Thursday granted petitioners leave to serve Meta in California, U.S., after they failed to trace the social media giant’s office locally. It emerged that while Meta has business operations in Kenya, it doesn’t have a physical office, as its local employees work remotely. The decision lays the groundwork for the beginning of a lawsuit filed in December last year by Kenyan rights group Katiba Institute, and Ethiopian researchers Fisseha Tekle and Abrham Meareg. Meareg’s father, professor Meareg Amare Abrha, was killed during the Tigray War after posts on Facebook doxed and called for violence against him, the lawsuit alleges. The petitioners seek to compel Meta to stop viral hate on Facebook, ramp up content review at the moderation hub in Kenya, and to create a $1.6 billion compensation fund. The petitioners allege that Facebook’s algorithm amplified hateful and inciteful posts that drew more interactions and kept users logged in for longer. They claim Facebook “under-invested” in human content review at the hub in Kenya, risking lives as it ignored, rejected or acted sluggishly to take down posts that also violated its community standards. Meareg said his family has firsthand experience of how flawed content moderation could endanger lives, and break up families. He claims his father was murdered after Meta failed to act on repeated requests to take down posts that targeted him and other Tigrayans, as calls for massacre against the ethnic group spread online and offline. The Tigray War, which lasted two years, erupted in November 2020 after the Ethiopian army clashed with Tigray forces, leaving 600,000 people dead. “My father was killed because posts published on Facebook identified him, accused him falsely, leaked the address of where he lives and called for his death,” said Meareg, a former PhD student, adding that he was forced to flee the country and seek asylum in the U.S. after his father’s death. “My father’s case is not an isolated one. Around the time of the posts and his death, Facebook was saturated with hateful, inciteful and dangerous posts…many other tragedies like ours have taken place,” he said. Meta declined to comment. Meareg says he reported the posts he came across, but his reports were either rejected or ignored. He claims to have reported several posts in 2021, including one that contained dead bodies, and some of those posts were still on the social site by the time he went to court last December. He faulted Facebook’s content review, saying the hub in Kenya had only 25 moderators responsible for Amharic, Tigrinya and Oromo content, which left out 82 other languages without personnel to moderate. Meta previously told TechCrunch that it employed teams and technology to help it remove hate speech and incitement, and that it had partners and staff with local knowledge to help it develop methods to catch violating content. “A flaw has been allowed to grow within Facebook, transforming it into a weapon for spreading hatred, violence and even genocide,” said Martha Dark, director of Foxglove, a tech justice NGO supporting the case. “Meta could take real action, today, to pull the plug on hatred spreading across Facebook.” This is not the first time Meta is being accused of fueling violence in Ethiopia. Whistleblower Frances Haugen previously accused it of “literally fanning ethnic violence” in Ethiopia, and a Global Witness investigation also noted that Facebook was poor at detecting hate speech in the main language of Ethiopia. Rights groups, activists and whistleblowers last week co-signed an open letter calling on Facebook to make changes to its algorithm and put in better protections. Currently, social media platforms including Facebook remain blocked in Ethiopia since early February after state-led plans to split Ethiopian Orthodox Tewhado Church caused anti-government protests. Meta is facing three lawsuits in Kenya. The company and its content review partner in sub-Saharan Africa, Sama, were sued in Kenya last May for exploitation and union busting by Daniel Motaung, a former content moderator. Motaung claimed to have been fired by Sama for organizing a 2019 strike that sought to unionize Sama’s employees. He was suing Meta and Sama for forced labor, exploitation, human trafficking, unfair labor relations, union busting and failure to provide “adequate” mental health and psychosocial support. Meta sought to have its name struck off the suit, saying Motaung was not its employee, and that the Kenyan court had no jurisdiction over it. However, it failed to stop the lawsuit after the court ruled that it had a case to answer, as some aspects of how the company operates in the country make it liable. The social media giant has appealed the court’s decision. Earlier this month, Meta was sued alongside Sama and another content review partner, Majorel, by 183 content moderators who alleged they were laid off unlawfully and blacklisted. The moderators claimed they were fired by Sama unlawfully after it wound down its content review arm, and that Meta instructed its new Luxembourg-based partner, Majorel, to blacklist ex-Sama content moderators. Meta sought to be struck out of this case as well, but last week, the Kenyan court said it had jurisdiction over employer-employee disputes and “matters of alleged unlawful and unfair termination of employment on grounds of redundancy” and that it had power “to enforce alleged violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms” by Meta, Sama and Majorel.   Updated to include thoughts shared in an open letter to Meta by rights groups, activists, and whistleblowers"

327,Alibaba splits into six in biggest overhaul in 24 years,['@ritacyliao'],"March 28, 2023","Alibaba never fails to show it’s a fan of restructuring to stay nimble in an ever-changing environment. The e-commerce behemoth said Tuesday that it will split into six business groups, which will each be managed by their respective CEOs and follow a holding company structure. Each CEO will report to a board of directors and assume full responsibility for company performance. The decision, which it describes as the “most significant governance overhaul in the platform company’s 24-year history,” came just a day after Jack Ma was spotted in China for the first time after spending months abroad. The reappearance of the billionaire founder of Alibaba and Ant Group has become a source of intrigue for investors and entrepreneurs, who see his whereabouts as a bellwether of Beijing’s relationship with the private sector. Over the past three years or so, China has imposed a sweeping regulatory crackdown on the tech industry, freezing the IPO of Ant and driving Didi to delist from the U.S. But in recent weeks, the country has made efforts to restore confidence in the business community, for instance, by hosting a high-profile corporate summit that attracted the likes of Tim Cook and Ray Dalio. Alibaba is reorganizing its digital empire to reconcile with changes in the tech industry. “This transformation will empower all our businesses to become more agile, enhance decision-making, and enable faster responses to market changes,” said Daniel Zhang, current CEO of Alibaba, in an email to employees. Zhang will continue to serve as the chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group. “The market is the best litmus test, and each business group and company can pursue independent fundraising and IPOs when they are ready,” said the CEO. The setup means the staff and leaders of each subsidiary would be better incentivized by their respective stock option plans. It also offers flexibility to Alibaba’s businesses to seek IPOs in different jurisdictions, where approval processes could vary greatly. When it comes to impact on staff, the reorg is undoing the organizational structure that it prided itself on for years — the “middle platform,” which are middle and back office functions that can be reused across departments for data and business purposes. These resources will transition into the relevant business groups and companies going forward and only retain functions required for listed company compliance, according to Alibaba. As the units become more independent, resources will be siloed, which will inevitably lead to redundancy; but the good news is some departments might need to increase their headcount after months of big layoffs. The six business groups of Alibaba are Cloud Intelligence Group (cloud computing — think AWS), Taobao Tmall Commerce Group (domestic retail businesses), Local Services Group (on-demand businesses like food delivery), Cainiao Smart Logistics (logistics), Global Digital Commerce Group (overseas retail businesses, including Lazada) and Digital Media and Entertainment Group (including the likes of video streaming).

328,French parliament votes for biometric surveillance at Paris Olympics,['@riptari'],"March 24, 2023","European Union lawmakers are on track to ban the use of remote biometric surveillance for general law enforcement purposes. However that hasn’t stopped parliamentarians in France voting to deploy AI to monitor public spaces for suspicious behavior during the 2024 Paris Olympics. On Thursday the parliament approved a plan to use automated behavioral surveillance of public spaces during the games, ignoring objections from around 40 MPs who had penned an open letter denouncing the proposal. The vote followed an earlier approval by the French Senate. (Via Politico.) The 2024 Olympics Games are due to take place in Paris between July 26 and August 11. The EU’s AI Act, an incoming risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI, includes a prohibition on the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement — with, in the original draft proposal, exceptions allowed for searches of specific potential victims of crime (such as missing children); for the prevention of “a specific, substantial and imminent threat” to life or physical safety or a terrorist attack; or for identifying a specific perpetrator or suspect of a criminal offence referred. Although MEPs have been pushing for a more comprehensive ban. Critics of the French plan suggest it goes far further than the limited law enforcement exceptions allowed for in the draft proposal — leaning on unproven AI to identify something as vague as suspicious behavior. Commenting in a statement, Patrick Breyer, an MEP in the European Parliament with the Pirate Party, hit out at use of what he dubbed an “error-prone” and intrusive technology, saying: “The French Parliament‘s decision to authorize automated behavioral surveillance in public spaces to look for ‘abnormal behavior’ creates a new reality of mass surveillance that is unprecedented in Europe. I expect the court to annul this indiscriminate surveillance legislation for violating our fundamental rights. “Such suspicion machines will report countless citizens wrongly, are discriminatory, educate to conformist behaviour and are absolutely useless in catching criminals, as studies and experiences have proven. Step by step, like in China, social diversity is threatened and our open society replaced by a conformist consumer society.” The AI Act was proposed by the European Commission almost two years ago but remains under negotiation by the bloc’s institutions — with discussion on the file complicated by divisions and ongoing tech developments, such as the rise of general purpose AIs like OpenAI’s GPT-4 (with general purpose AIs not explicitly included in the original proposal, underlining both how fast-moving the AI field is and, therefore, the challenge for regulators to create effective, future-proofed frameworks to regulate applications of the tech).  This means the full sweep and detail of the future pan-EU law is not yet settled. And even in a best case scenario — i.e. if the bloc’s lawmakers hash out a speedy compromise — it still may not be in application in time for the Paris Olympics. Nonetheless, the French move looks awkward, to say the least — suggesting the bloc is on course for a new era of legal friction between national security priorities and EU protections for fundamental rights.  France is one of several EU Member States that has repeatedly refused to bent to EU rules on general and indiscriminate data retention — countering that the activity is essential for national security — despite the bloc’s top court issuing a number of rulings that have found fault with such bulk data collection regimes. And future waves of legal challenges over state misuse of powerful AI tools, for general and indiscriminate surveillance, could well be speeding down the pipe. In the meanwhile, the French government’s plan to blanket the Paris Olympics in AI-powered surveillance could still face a challenge through the country’s constitutional court. So it remains to be seen whether attendees at the 2024 summer Olympic Games will face being behaviourally assessed by algorithms. The CNIL, France’s data protection watchdog, has been dialling up its attention on artificial intelligence in recent months — setting up a dedicated department to work on the technology in January, in preparation for the incoming EU AI Act. So it could take a close interest in the government’s plan. (We’ve reached out to the CNIL with questions about its views on the plan and will update this report if it responds.)"
329,WhatsApp’s multi-device feature now supports more than one phone,['@indianidle'],"April 25, 2023","WhatsApp is finally rolling out multi-device login support for more than one phone. Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature’s rollout on Facebook and Instagram. “Starting today, you can log into the same WhatsApp account on up to four phones,” he said. WhatsApp said that this feature is rolling out to all users within the coming weeks. Until now, users could only use one WhatsApp account on one phone and multiple companion desktop devices. With the new rollout, users’ messages will be synced across devices including other phones. So even if one device is switched off, they can access the app on other devices. WhatsApp is one of the biggest messaging services around with more than 2 billion users. But it lacked multiphone support until now because of full end-to-end encryption support for chats and calls. The company started testing multi-device compatibility back in 2021 with select beta users. At that time, Meta (known as Facebook at that time) said that it had developed new tech to sync messages across devices while maintaining end-to-end encryption protection. Other competitors like Telegram and Messenger offered multidevice sync for messages, but they didn’t have support for end-to-end encryption. In 2022, WhatsApp started making multidevice features available to everyone. But it didn’t support multiple phones. WhatsApp is also rolling out a new way to link devices using a one-time code. “You can now get a one-time-use code by entering your mobile number on WhatsApp Web, which you can use to link devices instead of scanning the QR code on your mobile phone. We’ll make this feature available for more linked devices in the future,” the company said in a blog post."
330,Apple (re)invents the iPod,['@harriblogs'],"April 6, 2023","Apple has devised a pocket-sized companion that (hypothetically) does it all: music, videos AND books, sans the nagging smartphone or clumsy smartwatch. Cupertino, you’re so close. In a patent application published recently by the U.S. Patent Office, Apple sketched out such a device, a headphone-case-meets-pocket-computer with a touchscreen display and the prerequisite guts for flicking through songs, watching movies, peeping the weather or even navigating somewhere via a mapping app. Put another way, time is a flat circle and Apple invented the iPod all over again. Judging by the filing, Apple sought to patent something reminiscent of a teensy iPod Touch or iPod Nano, but with a nook for charging a pair of wireless earbuds. This is only a patent application, which means there’s currently no (zilch! zero!) indication a supercharged AirPods case like this will exist beyond some doodles. Sure, the company could be exploring such a device, given its well–established interest in smarter earbuds. However, Apple may simply wish to lay down some metaphorical roadblocks for the competition via this filing. In any case, an iPod renaissance? Sounds dreamy to me. “The coolest thing about iPod is that you can take your entire music library with you, right in your pocket,” Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said millennia ago, in 2001. In the years since, everything and nothing has changed; music is arguably still the coolest thing about the iPhone, and it’s one reason why iPod nostalgia bubbles up time and time again — in the form of an unauthorized, iPod-inspired app; wistful tweets; a silly smartwatch accessory; movie cameos; letters to an editor; and so on. The iPod is dead, but our great yearning for devices that do less? That lives on."
331,Paramount alleges Warner Bros. Discovery owes $52M for ‘South Park’ streaming rights,['@laurenforristal'],"April 20, 2023","A few months after Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) sued Paramount over the streaming rights for “South Park,” Paramount is now striking back. On Wednesday, April 19, Paramount counter-sued WBD, alleging that the company is withholding two required payments of $26 million each, bringing the total unpaid fees to $52 million. “South Park Studios has abided by the terms of the written Term Sheet. WarnerMedia has not,” the countersuit writes. “Instead, despite continuously exploiting and profiting from the 300-plus episodes of South Park that is still available for streaming on HBO Max, Warner Media is refusing to pay tens of millions of dollars in license fees owed to South Park Studios for the right to exploit that content.” The counterclaim, filed in New York Supreme Court, argues that the unpaid fees cover the 318 “South Park” episodes streaming on HBO Max. The more than 300 episodes are from seasons 1 through 26. HBO Max is also streaming the made-for-television documentary “6 Days to Air: The Making of South Park,” which Paramount mentioned in the document. “To purportedly justify its non-payment, WarnerMedia has accused South Park Studios of breaching certain alleged obligations in the Term Sheet,” it added. In 2019, WBD paid $500 million for streaming rights to stream 23 seasons of the animated sitcom, as well as three new seasons (seasons 24, 25 and 26) that had yet to air. The deal was set to last through June 2025. In February of this year, WBD filed a lawsuit (Deadline acquired the document) that accused Paramount of breaching the deal, alleging that Paramount stole “South Park” content from HBO Max to put on its own streaming service, Paramount+. To be more specific, WBD said Paramount released new “South Park” specials on Paramount+, which WBD believes should’ve streamed on HBO Max. In 2021, Paramount’s MTV Studios paid a whopping $900 million in a deal with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The agreement, which runs through 2027, included six seasons of the show as well as 14 made-for-streaming movies that would stream exclusively on Paramount+. “We believe that Paramount and South Park Digital Studios embarked on a multi-year scheme of unfair trade practices and deception, flagrantly and repeatedly breaching our contract, which clearly gave HBO Max exclusive streaming rights to the existing library and new content from the popular animated comedy South Park,” a WBD spokesperson said in a statement that was shared with TechCrunch. “Warner Bros. Discovery’s argument that Paramount Global was required to deliver additional South Park content is baseless and wholly unsupported by the parties’ agreement. Furthermore, it certainly does not justify WBD’s refusal to pay for immensely valuable content, all of which it has received and from which it continues to profit,” a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement. In the February 2023 lawsuit, WBD declared that the company bid on the “South Park” streaming rights because it had assurance that the three yet-to-air seasons would consist of 10 episodes each. However, the company claims that Paramount failed to deliver on a number of episodes. WBD added it continues to take on damages of over $200 million “as a result of Defendants’ misconduct,” wrote the lawsuit. According to the company, the new episodes hold a higher value than the older ones. Therefore, WBD overpaid for the streaming rights."
332,Google Cloud turns profit for the first time,['@ron_miller'],"April 25, 2023","Google Cloud may be chasing Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud game, but it has something big to boast about after earnings came out today. The company has turned a profit on its cloud unit for the first time since it began reporting cloud income several years ago. The company reported cloud revenue of $7.4 billion in Q12023, that’s up from $5.8 billion in the year ago period, up 27.5%. But that growth is not the primary news nugget here. The company also reported an operating income loss of $706 million a year ago. This year it reported a $191 million gain. That’s huge for a company that has struggled in third place in the cloud market. Yet even while Google Cloud revenue grew 27.5% this quarter, that growth is slowing from 32% last quarter and 38% the one before that. Cloud spending in general has been slowing as companies look more carefully at their cloud spend and cut back where they can. Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, says that it shows how long a time horizon it requires to get to this point in this market. “It’s a significant milestone for Google Cloud, which started in April 2008. Fifteen years later, it’s now profitable. This shows how hard it is for new players to enter the space and what’s required to achieve escape velocity for cloud adoption,” Wang told TechCrunch Insider Intelligence senior analyst Max Willens says that the slowing growth tempers the profitability news. “Its cloud segment turning a profit is notable, and a testament to management’s diligence in steering Cloud toward profitability. But the reality is that Google Cloud remains comfortably behind its two most important competitors, and its growth is slowing,” he said. It’s worth noting that Google Cloud includes both the infrastructure and platform-as-a-service pieces — which competes directly with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure — along with Google Workspace, its productivity software package that includes corporate Gmail, Docs, Calendar and so forth. So that combined income means it’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison with its competitors, but it is still significant nonetheless, especially when you consider that the company reported losing a whopping $5.6 billion in the cloud unit in 2020. That’s quite a turnaround in just three years. Even as it reports this positive quarter, the company laid off 12,000 people in January. It also reported it was buying back $70 billion in stock. Meanwhile CNBC reported that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made $226 million in total compensation last year."
333,"Clockwork’s Cloud Deluxe platform eliminates packet drops, improves cloud network performance",['@fredericl'],"April 25, 2023","Clockwork today announced a new service that uses its clock synchronization service to eliminate packet drops to help businesses improve their network performance. A year ago, the company created a splash when it announced its clock synchronization service that helps businesses keep their server fleets in sync. Keeping clocks in sync with up to five-nanosecond accuracy (for hardware-based timestamps) is quite an achievement, but the idea here was always to go up the stack and build tools on top of this fundamental technology. The first tool, Latency Sensei, provides users with fine-grained data about latency in their networks. Now, Clockwork is bundling this tool with other features and a new “sense-and-control” dashboard for managing them all, aiming to help businesses reduce network latency, jitter and virtually eliminate packet drops between their machines, regardless of location or computing environments. Traditionally, to reduce packet drops (and those drops and their retransmissions are fundamental feature of TCP that make the internet work), network switches use buffers. But as Clockwork co-founder and Stanford computer science professor Balaji Prabhakar noted during an interview at KubeCon Europe earlier this month, this comes with a lot of overhead. One-way measurements, the Clockwork team argues, is a far more accurate indicator of congestion than packet drops and in the company’s demo, simply turning on this Packet Rocket congestion control feature, as the company calls it, drops packet loss to almost zero while reducing latency and increasing bandwidth utilization. That almost sounds too good to be true, but Clockwork can back up these claims and the company already has a number of enterprise customers that have successfully tested the overall Cloud Deluxe platform. “If we have accurate clocks in networks, the first thing we do is measure congestion very accurately — one way, not round-trip time divided by two. Second, if you can do the one-way measurement fast and accurately, then you can actually control congestion in a way that you couldn’t do before,” Prabhakar explained. “Because most of the problem with network congestion, if you don’t want to go towards packet drops — that’s the nuclear option — if you don’t want to go anywhere near that, people always say: here’s a buffer.” Figuring out how to measure congestion accurately is difficult, however, and even with a large buffer, it takes a number of packet drops (and the overhead associated with those) before the system reaches the necessary threshold to kick into action. Image Credits: Clockwork Systems Image Credits: Clockwork Systems With this core technology in place, Clockwork can then also easily allocate bandwidth to a given virtual machine and/or prioritize traffic based on the needs of a given application. With the latency data in place, the company can also discover which machines are likely co-located on the same physical host, allowing businesses to move workloads to avoid the noisy siblings problem. “Clockwork Systems is helping us gain better visibility into our complex multi-cloud environment,” said Albert Greenberg, vice president of Platform Engineering at Uber. “Clockwork‘s breakthrough technology can pinpoint congestion bottlenecks with accurate latency measurements — and fix the problem by killing packet delays and eliminating packet drops. We’re impressed by the trials so far, and we’re exploring the potential for Clockwork‘s Cloud Deluxe software to help us build high-performance network infrastructure on top of generic cloud environments.” Soon, Prabhakar told me, the company will also be able to enable better snapshotting of the network state for backups and disaster recovery. Traditionally, to get an accurate snapshot of the network state, you would have to pause the application, wait for the packets to reach their destination and then create the snapshot. But with more accurate clocks, it’s possible to simply say: all the VMs take a break for a few nanoseconds, wait a few milliseconds for everything that’s still in flight to land, take the snapshot and resume. All of this is now powered by Clockwork’s UniChron API, which allows users to set dynamic bounds on clock accuracy and is controlled through the company’s new interactive control panel. The company also offers programmatic access to all features through APIs.  "
334,Luup raises $30M ahead of Japan’s new micromobility rules,['@kateparknews'],"April 26, 2023","Japanese shared micromobility startup Luup has raised $30 million (4.5 billion yen) in a Series D financing round, which consists of 3.8 billion yen in equity and 700 million yen in debt. Luup has now amassed a total of $68 million in equity, debt and asset financing to date, at what sources said valued the firm at more than $100 million. The company declined to comment on the valuation. In light of the sector’s growing popularity, the Japanese government has been proactive in loosening e-scooter regulations to further stimulate the micromobility industry. Starting this July, amendments to the country’s Road Traffic Act will permit e-scooter users to ride without driver licenses or helmets, as long as they maintain a maximum speed of 20 kilometers per hour. In an interview with TechCrunch, Luup CEO Daiki Okai said the startup’s ambitious plan is to expand its e-scooter and e-bike business across Japanese cities and tourist destinations. It aims to achieve a scale comparable to traditional public transportation modes, such as trains, catering to hundreds of thousands of daily commuters. Luup also wants to transform underutilized open spaces into “ports,” or delegated parking stations for its e-scooters and e-bikes, including office buildings, condominiums, storefronts and smaller urban spaces. Historically, Japanese cities were developed around major train stations, which has resulted in an inconvenient transportation system for those living far from these central hubs. Luup aims to make the entire city “a station front,” creating a high-density network to bridge the convenience gap for those living farther from train stations, he said. Founded in 2018, Luup introduced its shared e-scooters in 2021 and has grown its fleet to approximately 10,000 e-scooters and e-bikes. The company reports over 1 million app downloads in Japan and has expanded its network of ports to 3,000 across six cities this year. Luup’s goal is to operate more than 10,000 parking stations by 2025. Although other companies such as Docomo Bike Share and Open Streets also operate shared e-bikes, they lack e-scooters and have fewer ports than Luup. The Japanese startup currently holds the largest number of ports in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. Some global e-scooter operators have also entered the Tokyo market, such as the U.S.-based Bird and South Korea-based Swing, but they have had limited success so far. With the revised Road Traffic Law going into effect this July, Okai said he anticipates a surge in commuters, including foreign visitors, as e-scooters will no longer require a Japanese driver’s license. He also sees potential for Luup’s high-density station network to facilitate expansion into broader infrastructure businesses, such as drone and delivery robot hubs.  "
335,Announcing the Builders Stage agenda at Disrupt 2023,['@alex'],"April 25, 2023","TechCrunch Disrupt, our yearly flagship startup event, returns to San Francisco on September 19–21 — and you can bet TechCrunch+ will be in the house. It’s going to be the biggest and best Disrupt we’ve ever hosted: Along with a few to-be-announced surprises, we’ll have Startup Battlefield, as well as six new stages with targeted materials for founders of all types. With that in mind, I am very proud to announce the agenda for the Builders Stage, something that we’ve been working hard on for months. If you went to Disrupt 2022, you’ll recall the TechCrunch+ Stage, which hosted dozens of panels and interviews focused on the nuts and bolts of building and funding new tech enterprises. In 2023, it’s back under a new moniker. This year, you’ll swing by the Builders Stage for more of the same great programming. We’ll be talking operations, hiring, fundraising and more, hitting on key topics for a new generation of startup founders. And the TechCrunch+ lounge will make a return as well, so whether you’re busy taking notes inside or drinking coffee with the rest of us just outside, we have a lot planned for you. Lots more to come, but here’s a first look at: with Noramay Cadena (Supply Change Capital), Mac Conwell (RareBreed Ventures) and Turner Novak (Banana Capital) Venture funds aren’t new, and neither are solo GPs. What is a fresh innovation in venture land, however, is building a new fund or firm in public. Some newer investors are as well-known for their online presence as for their investments. And that’s no diss: Raising capital is tough, and building a brand is no sin. Still, we want to know both the pros and cons of building something as complicated as a venture fund without a filter. Founders, there will be learnings for you as well, even if you are a few exits away from hanging up your spurs and taking the other side of the deal-making table. with Nick Cromydas (Hunt Club) and speakers to be announced It seems like it was just yesterday that the tech talent market was so hot that mega-corps hoarded staff to simply keep them off the market and out of the reach of their competitors. Today things are different: Layoffs are more common than hiring binges, and suddenly perks have a bad name. How can startups use a new, and perhaps more attractive, talent market to their advantage? Let’s find out. with Sophia Amoruso (Trust Fund, Business Class) and Sarah Kunst (Cleo Capital) Chasing the next big thing is often a pretty good idea for founders and investors alike. But when folks are chasing the wrong trend, the hype can be more siren song than victory march. When should founders follow the hype? When should they ignore it? Let’s talk about it. with Ashley Mayer (Coalition Operators), Amanda Robson (Cowboy Ventures) and Richie Serna (Finix) Venture investors are no longer all located on the same road at the same time in the same city in the same state of the same country. They’re all over the world, and are increasingly — if slowly — diverse across a host of metrics. How can founders construct an investor pool that reflects their values? In this discussion, we’ll dig into the brass tacks of building a truly equitable cap table. with Anamitra Banerji (Afore Capital), Frederique Dame (Google Ventures) and Rick Yang (NEA) Cash is worth more this year than last year, and certainly more than the tech industry got accustomed to during the last venture supercycle. With the dollar now more powerful than ever, how should startups ensure that their raised capital — equity, debt, whatever floats your burn — goes as far as possible? After all, the more you can do before you need more cash, the higher a price you can charge in your next round. with Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins (Promise), Ruben Harris (Career Karma) and Ritu Narayan (Zūm)  While the hoodie-wearing, 20-something college dropout from a world-famous school still has their place in today’s startup founder makeup, they’re hardly the only sort of person raising big rounds and building hot companies. How can founders who don’t fit the Hollywood or HBO stereotype use their experiences to their benefit? We’ll find out in this highly anticipated panel. with Amir Ashkenazi (Switchboard), Tyson Hendricksen (Notice) and Maria Taylor (Beacon Capital)  Look, we all want more IPOs. But they’re still far rarer than startups need them to be if they want to retain staff who want to see their hard-earned shares turn into something other than paper. So when should founders take a little pre-IPO liquidity as a treat, and when should they let staff do the same? with Chris Power (Hadrian) and Nikki Pechet (Homebound) Every VC wants you to think that they’re bravely funding expensive hardware that will revolutionize the future. You know, space launches that use twigs, and satellites that can also zap aliens. That sort of thing. And then you read about new NFT fundraising. The good news is that even in a more conservative venture environment, it’s possible for founders to tackle big, hard and capital-intensive projects. Let’s talk about how it’s done. with Jomayra Herrera (Reach Capital), Helen Min (Phenomenal Ventures) and Monique Woodard (Cake Ventures) Writing a good market slide is an art. You don’t want to oversell your total addressable market (TAM) and look silly, or post a number that’s too small to be exciting. Nailing TAM for both external pitching and internal planning is no small feat. Let’s dig into the matter with today’s more picky venture market in mind. with Naba Banerjee (Airbnb) and Asha Sharma (Instacart) Lost amid glossy founder profiles and funding announcements are the nuts and bolts of scaling a startup’s internal operations. The real stuff that comes with building a scaling startup. From this panel expect operational notes and tips that you can put to work to avoid known pitfalls and to generally kick maximum ass. with Carey Smith (Unorthodox Ventures) and Hussein Yahfoufi (Arta Finance) It’s possible to build huge companies without venture money. So long as your startup brings in more cash than it burns, you’re in business. But bootstrapping in tech circles often carries negative connotations — phrases like “lifestyle business” are sometimes thrown around. But with many startups realizing that they aren’t going to be able to raise more money, perhaps it’s time to give bootstrapping another look? Disrupt 2023 runs September 19–21 in San Francisco.

336,Venti raises $29M to design autonomous vehicles for industrial and logistics hubs,['@ingridlunden'],"March 28, 2023","We are still likely many years away from wide-scale deployment, let alone adoption, of fully autonomous vehicles on our streets, but in the meantime, autonomous vehicle companies focusing on closed-campus environments continue to raise funding and make headway in building self-driving on a smaller scale. In the latest, a startup called Venti Technologies has raised $28.8 million, a Series A that it plans to use to continue building its software, partner with third parties for hardware (that is, vehicles), and to secure more deals. Its target customer comes from the wide range of supply chain businesses that operate across warehouses, ports and other shipping and logistics environments where vehicles — currently driven by humans — are central to operations. Venti’s bet is that even with the high prices associated with self-driving vehicles, industrial customers, a market that generates billions in revenues annually, will pay up, because it will pay off for them in the long term. “If you have a big logistics facility where you run vehicles, the largest cost is human capital: drivers,” Dr. Heidi Wyle, Venti’s CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. “Our customers are telling us that they expect to save over 50% of their operations costs with self-driving vehicles. Think they will have huge savings.” LG Technology Ventures, the VC arm of the LG Group, is leading this round, with Safar Partners, UOB Venture Management, and previous investors Alpha JWC and LDV Partners also participating. Venti last raised $8 million in the summer of 2021. Valuation is not being disclosed. Venti is coming at the industrial market after getting its fingers burned a little from its initial ambitions in the consumer market. Founded originally out of work on robotics and related fields done by co-founder Daneila Rus at MIT (“she invented autonomy” is how Wyle likes to describe it), the startup’s early efforts were in areas like SUVs and robo-taxi models. But as Wyle recalls, the startup discovered that the complexity of the scenarios was ultimately insurmountable. “What I’ve seen is that robo-taxi is an extremely difficult problem to solve,” she said. “All of the chaos of the world is sitting in those city streets. Industrial environments are utterly different. It’s not a sexy space, but the global supply chain is huge and it got whacked in COVID. They are still digging themselves out of that and we enable them to work better [now] and if another thing like COVID comes along.” The bonus of campus environments is not just that the spaces in which they operate, and the variables at play, are both finite and definable, but typically, the whole operation is carried out at much slower speeds, which makes it easier to correct errors when and if they do arise. That being said, the company is not yet in fully-autonomous mode even in the closed environment. Wyle declined to name any of its customers, vehicle partners, any specific pilots it is running, nor pricing for its software and hardware. Competition is super-fierce for business in this space, I suspect. But she noted that the pilots it is running involve drivers behind the wheels of its vehicles, and that it is working closely with manufacturers of logistics vehicles to fit the first of these that will be fully-autonomous with no driver assistance and no drivers behind the wheels. “We allow our customers to give us wheels and then we oversee a ‘drive-by-wire’ conversion,” she said, referring to the retrofitting and putting the electronics in place to run them as autonomous vehicles. “After this year, we will move into production-grade vehicles for a big port manufacturer.” That software, she added, is based on what Rus worked on initially at MIT and “does all the core autonomy that runs in the vehicle,” which includes logistics algorithms that are tailored to Venti’s target market segments. Ultimately, even when vehicles are not “manned” by humans, there will likely be people in control centers monitoring and potentially intervening in the vehicles’ movements if needed, Wyle said. Venti is not the only one chasing this opportunity. Others in the same space include EasyMile (which has been on the radar of VCs), Outrider (which raised a big round this year), and Aidrivers. LG, an industrial giant itself both as a primary business and as a supplier to industrial businesses, is not a strategic partner currently, but Wyle said that this is the long-term hope. “Venti is solving real-world problems for large customers in huge markets with technology that has proven safe, mature and capable of near-term driverless deployment,” said Anshul Agarwal, MD at LG Technology Ventures, in a statement. “We are impressed not only by the technology, which is more complete and rapidly able to provide value to end customers, but also by the world-class team.”"
337,"As the SEC charges Bittrex, there’s little evidence that it’s relaxing its regulatory posture",['@alex'],"April 17, 2023","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Monday that it’s charging Bittrex, a crypto exchange, “for operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency.” The SEC is also charging Bittrex’s foreign entity for “failing to register as a national securities exchange in connection with its operation of a single shared order book” with its parent company. In recent weeks we’ve seen the SEC take on Coinbase and Tron, not to mention Binance taking fire from a different American government agency (the CFTC). Suffice it to say that after lagging behind the crypto market’s growth, government regulators are stepping up to the plate. Reactions vary to the SEC’s recent actions. In the crypto community, there’s a generally held perspective that the U.S. government is being too heavy-handed in its enforcement actions; that its rules are either too vague or poorly fitting for web3-related assets and activity; and that regulators should work more closely with the industry to come up with new rules for what some consider to be a novel method of approaching the exchange of value. The SEC disagrees. In a comment that should serve as a clear portent of future activity, the agency said that its Bittrex-related action “makes plain that the crypto markets suffer from a lack of regulatory compliance, not a lack of regulatory clarity.” If you were hoping that the SEC would relax its posture that crypto assets are more often securities — and therefore under the purview of existing regulation — this is not good news. In the case of Bittrex, the agency points out that the crypto exchange took actions to specifically avoid SEC oversight: Bittrex and [William] Shihara, who was the company’s CEO from 2014 to 2019, coordinated with issuers who sought to have their crypto asset made available for trading on Bittrex’s platform to first delete from public channels certain “problematic statements” that Shihara believed would lead a regulator, such as the SEC, to investigate the crypto asset as the offering of a security. For example, in an effort to avoid regulatory scrutiny, before Bittrex would make an asset available on its platform, Bittrex and Shihara instructed issuer-applicants to delete statements related to “price prediction[s],” “expectation of profit,” and other “investment related terms.” Bittrex was not a globally leading exchange; ranked somewhere around 40th in global volume, news of the SEC’s actions have yet to shake the crypto markets in any material sense. Still, small cuts can lead to material bloodletting, something that the web3 world can ill afford in its current downturn."

339,A judge dismissed Phhhoto’s antitrust suit against Meta,['@tayhatmaker'],"March 31, 2023","A U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of New York threw out a lawsuit against Meta this week that had been simmering for a year and a half. The suit, filed in late 2021 by now-shuttered social app Phhhoto, alleged that Meta violated federal antitrust law by copying its core features with the Instagram-adjacent video looping app Boomerang. Like Boomerang, which Meta launched in October of 2015 and later integrated into Instagram itself, Phhhoto invited users to share very short GIF-like loops. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto ultimately granted Meta’s motion to dismiss the complaint due to time-limits imposed by the relevant statutes of limitations. “Phhhoto has failed in its 69-page Amended Complaint of 222 paragraphs to allege sufficient facts that cure the untimeliness of all of its federal claims,” Matsumoto wrote in the opinion, calling the possibility of any amendment to resolve the issue of the lawsuit’s timing “futile.”   In the lawsuit, Phhhoto alleged that Boomerang was the culmination of Facebook’s anticompetitive full-court press, effectively killing the smaller company with a copycat app that reproduced Phhhoto’s offering “feature-by-feature.” In a statement, Meta spokesperson Stephen Peters noted that Meta was pleased with the outcome, maintaining that the suit was “meritless.” The saga had a few twists and turns, including evidence that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself downloaded Phhhoto and made an account a full year before launching Boomerang. Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, who led Instagram at the time, also explored the app’s features at the time. According to the lawsuit, Facebook began chatting up the team at Phhhoto, even dangling a partnership — an offer that languished and never materialized. By 2017, Phhhoto was no more. 🙏🏽RIP PHHHOTO® 2014-2017🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/u3tCdikRA1 — PHHHOTO (@PHHHOTO) June 20, 2017 "
340,YouTube will livestream all six Coachella stages across both weekends,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 3, 2023","YouTube announced today that for the first time it will be livestreaming all six stages during both weekends of Coachella. In the past, the Google-owned company only livestreamed three stages. The music festival kicks off on April 14 at 7 PM ET and resumes April 21 at the same time. “This year we will be live streaming Coachella from more stages than ever before with 6 feeds in action (double the amount from last year) across both weekends,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Whether you’re watching from home, abroad, or at parties with friends, anyone can tune into Coachella’s YouTube Channel, pick a stage, and watch the performances happening live with the rest of the fans.” If you can’t tune in live, the festival sets will be on repeat after the night’s final performance until the live show picks back up the next day. In between sets, viewers will see on-the-ground coverage of artists, installations, behind-the-scenes Shorts moments and more. YouTube has also partnered with Coachella to drop exclusive merch from over a dozen artists. Items will be available for purchase directly on the livestream and through YouTube Shorts on Coachella’s channel via YouTube Shopping. In addition, Premium subscribers will have access to backstage “pre-parties.” This year marks the eleventh time that fans can tune into the music festival on YouTube. Earlier this year, YouTube announced that it signed a multiyear renewal of its exclusive livestream and content partnership agreement with Coachella through 2026. Coachella is one of the most popular music festivals in the world, so it’s notable for YouTube to be the exclusive livestream partner of the event for the past decade, especially as it continues to compete with other video apps like TikTok. Bad Bunny, Blackpink and Frank Ocean top this year’s Coachella lineup. Other artists include Calvin Harris, Gorillaz, Björk, Rosalía, Eric Prydz, Burna Boy, Kali Uchis, Porter Robinson, Blondie, Becky G and more.  "
341,4 problems venture capital can’t solve,[],"April 20, 2023","As the technology industry retrenches and venture capital firms tighten their standards, savvy founders should consider this counterintuitive question: Even if my vision is compelling enough to secure funding, should I take it? Today’s marketplace is teeming with companies that simply grew too quickly, aided and abetted by their VC partners, and now find themselves managing the pain of down rounds, expense reductions, layoffs and a retreat from their boldest strategic gambles. Would it have been better for many of them to have not taken excessive levels of venture capital in the first place? This might seem like a strange question coming from me. As an investor, my job is to put capital to work. But the truth is, I see founders every day looking for money for the wrong reasons. They — and to some extent we, as investors — have lost sight of when venture capital can be an accelerant and when it can hasten the demise of what might have been a viable business. In recent years, increasing pressure to invest ready capital meant that investors were not as discerning as they otherwise might have been. In 2021, VCs poured a record-breaking $329.1 billion into startups. Some of that capital was clearly not put to its best use. This reckoning underpins the 63% drop in funding in the fourth quarter of 2022 over the same period in 2021. Without a clear picture of what is fueling losses, venture capital will only accelerate your demise. Add inflation, corporate cost-cutting and market volatility, and it’s understandable why many investors and founders are skittish. For an entrepreneur looking to raise money, the current landscape could prove difficult. But even for founders who can still attract capital, it’s a time to be wary: It’s quite possible that you could destroy your business deploying that cash. Consider some of the wrong reasons to raise money: Imagine a founder looking to grow a same-day delivery service in a niche market with negative unit economics. They seek venture funding to increase sales and marketing. But the business isn’t making money on a contribution margin basis, only the variable costs of a good or service. Their assumption — likely incorrect — might be that new money for sales and marketing will solve the company’s problems. In reality, what is needed is a deep dive into the company’s fundamentals. Most of the time, what stands between a company and its ability to achieve scale is not a lack of money. It’s better to ask: Do we have hustle problems? Product problems? Process problems? People problems? Is my business model fundamentally flawed? More money won’t solve these issues. Without a clear picture of what is fueling losses, venture capital will only accelerate your demise."
342,UK to press ahead with long anticipated reform to tackle Big Tech’s market power,['@riptari'],"April 25, 2023","The U.K. has signalled it will press ahead with an ex ante competition reform aimed at addressing the market muscle of Big Tech. The legislation will also aim to strengthen consumer rights by targeting fake reviews and subscription traps, with the aim of making it less of a minefield for web users to shop online and extricate themselves from unwanted contracts. The government, under current prime minister Rishi Sunak, looks to be retrieving a ball that was hoofed into the long grass by former PM Boris Johnson — when, just over a year ago, he dodged pressing ahead with the long anticipated ex ante digital competition reform in favor of dither and delay. Today ministers at the restyled Department for Business and Trade and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology announced that new legislation would be introduced to empower the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) to oversee platforms which are deemed to have so-called strategic market status (SMS). Commenting in a statement, business and trade minister Kevin Hollinrake said: From abuse of power by tech giants, to fake reviews, scams and rip-offs like being caught in a subscription trap — consumers deserve better. The new laws we’re delivering today will empower the CMA to directly enforce consumer law, strengthen competition in digital markets and ensure that people across the country keep hold of their hard-earned cash. The DMU has been operating in shadow form at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for over two years in anticipation of the necessary enforcement powers which elsewhere in Europe lawmakers have been moving ahead on their own ex ante reforms. For example, Germany updated its domestic regime at the start of 2021 and has multiple investigations and enforcements into companies including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta ongoing at this point — with some wins it can point to. European Union lawmakers also cinched agreement on the Digital Markets Act last year — with the proactive oversight regime set to kick in on Internet gatekeepers later this year. So the U.K. is playing catch up with regional peers. The delay has led to certain complications for the CMA, which appeared to have anticipated the DMU being empowered rather sooner — hence an initial decision not to act on a number of concerns raised in a preliminary market study of the mobile duopoly, Apple and Google. (Although it did take enforcement action in relation to Google Play Billing at that time, which led to a settlement offer by the tech giant which the CMA is now consulting on.) The regulator later sought to reverse its decision to wait for new powers when it sought to push forward with an investigation into Apple’s mobile web browser and cloud gaming service. However, earlier this month, Apple successfully appealed the delay in opening a probe as a breach of standard legislative protocol. The overarching issue driving the need for ex ante competition reform is classic competition powers are perceived to be too slow and reactive to respond effectively to market power in the digital sphere, which benefits from powerful concentration dynamics like network effects — leaving consumers and startups at the risk of unfair T&Cs. The legislation will aim to cut the time it takes for competition intervention by empowering the CMA to be able to directly enforce consumer law, rather than having to go through lengthy court processes. There will also be beefed up penalties for breaches of consumer law — with penalties that can scale up to 10% of global turnover. The U.K.’s planned approach to ex ante competition reform is distinct versus the EU’s. Instead of a prescriptive list of operational ‘dos and don’ts’ set out in the law that apply to all in-scope platforms, the government intends the DMU to design bespoke conditions tailored to each tech giant in question — which it claims will ensure oversight is proportional and there’s no risk of overregulation. “The bill establishes a new, targeted regime built for the digital age, overseen by the [DMU] in the CMA – that will use a proportionate approach to hold digital firms accountable for their actions – enabling all innovating businesses to compete fairly,” said the CMA in a press release. “It will set rules that will prevent firms with Strategic Market Status [SMS] from using their size and power to limit digital innovation or market access – ensuring the UK remains a highly attractive place to invest and do business for all.” In a statement, its CEO Sarah Cardell added: We welcome this flagship bill which provides the CMA with new powers to do even more to protect people, businesses and support the economy. This has the potential to be a watershed moment in the way we protect consumers in the UK and the way we ensure digital markets work for the UK economy, supporting economic growth, investment and innovation. People rely on free and fair markets to get the best deal possible, but also expect that rules are in place to protect them when things go wrong. Proposals to give the CMA stronger enforcement powers when firms break consumer law – including the ability to directly impose fines for the first time – are crucial to ensure we can continue cracking down on rip-offs and underhand deals, helping to deter firms from taking advantage of people. Digital markets offer huge benefits, but only if competition enables businesses of all shapes and sizes the opportunity to succeed. This bill is a legal framework fit for the digital age. It will establish a tailored, evidenced-based and proportionate approach to regulating the largest and most powerful digital firms to ensure effective competition that benefits everyone. We look forward to supporting this bill as it passes through the legislative process and stand ready to use these new powers once approved by Parliament. A supporting statement from startup advocacy group Coadec also welcomed the development — with exec director Dom Hallas warning of “bed-blocking incumbents in broken markets” standing in the way of startup-driven competition. “The Digital Markets Unit can become a powerful tool to help innovative companies break through,” he added.  On fake reviews, the government said the bill will ban the practice of facilitating fake reviews or advertising consumer reviews without taking reasonable steps to check they are genuine. On subscriptions that deploy dark patterns and other trips to lock consumers in the government said the new rules will ensure web users are able to exit such contracts in “a straightforward, cost-effective, and timely way” — such as by requiring that businesses send a reminder when a free trial or introductory offer is coming to an end. “This will help deliver one of the Government’s five priorities to grow the economy by increasing consumer choice and confidence in the products they buy and services they use,” it added. There’s no firm timeline for when the new legislation may be in place — but minds in Sunak’s government’s are likely being concentrated by the limited time left they have to make a mark on the British public before a general election must be called (the latter must happen in January 2025 at the very latest). In additional public remarks, the government said the new measures will come into effect “as soon as possible following parliamentary approval”. Albeit, ministers also note the new powers may be subject to secondary legislation and the publication of guidance — so, again, there could be a longer runway before GAFAM giants are forced to amend how they do business in the U.K.    "
343,GM leads $50M EnergyX deal to lock down lithium for its EVs,['@harriblogs'],"April 11, 2023","Eager to secure all the lithium it needs to power a growing lineup of electric vehicles, General Motors said on Tuesday that it will lead a $50 million investment into lithium extraction and refining startup EnergyX. With the deal, the legacy automaker says it will help EnergyX scale its lithium-extraction tech. In exchange, GM will get exclusive access to some of the lithium that EnergyX sources from mining companies in North and South America. The companies declined to disclose the extent of this exclusivity deal, but in an email to TechCrunch, GM spokesperson David Caldwell said it “is capped at certain points, not unlimited.” The companies also did not name the other investors involved in the $50 million funding round. Lithium demand has surged in the past few years, thanks in no small part to the rise of electric vehicles and renewables. The push for evermore lithium is driving companies such as EnergyX to seek more efficient — and less environmentally destructive — extraction methods. Earlier this year, EnergyX said that its tech can “extract lithium from brine resources using little to no water, and does not require heavy metals or chemical additives.” The Austin, Texas, and San Juan, Puerto Rico–based startup bears no relation to a similarly named, Seoul-based company called Energy X, which focuses on decarbonizing buildings. Like other automakers, this isn’t GM’s first investment in a lithium mining company. In January, the automaker said it would pump a whopping $650 million into Lithium Americas to help fund a mine in Nevada. "
344,Elon Musk says Twitter will finally remove legacy checkmarks on 4/20,['@indianidle'],"April 12, 2023","Elon Musk said that Twitter will finally move to remove the legacy blue checkmarks on April 20 or 4/20 because he can’t let go of that joke. This is the “final date,” he said in a tweet. If the move goes through, Twitter will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, and government entities and officials. Final date for removing legacy Blue checks is 4/20 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 11, 2023  The company initially announced last month that legacy checkmarks will be removed on April 1. But like many Musk-promised deadlines, the date passed and nothing happened. Earlier today, Musk gave an interview to BBC over a Twitter Spaces session. When asked about how taking away verification marks would impact disinformation spread, Musk said “I think the media is a driver of misinformation much more than the media would like to admit that they are.”   Earlier this month, in a now-deleted tweet, Musk pointed out that the company was going to give “a few week’s grace” to legacy verified accounts. Elon Musk quickly deleted a tweet saying legacy verified accounts would not lose their checkmarks on April 1 as he previously said, won’t happen for another “few weeks” however, if they specifically say they won’t pay for Twitter Blue, then Twitter will remove their checkmark pic.twitter.com/HiiWwf30tb — Matt Binder (@MattBinder) April 2, 2023  Last month, Musk also said that Twitter will stop recommending non-verified accounts on its “For You” algorithmic timeline starting April 15. Recently, the company changed the label shown when someone taps on the verification mark to “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” This made it harder for people to differentiate between Twitter Blue subscribers and legacy verified accounts. The social network is also reportedly working on verification through government ID, which will let Twitter Blue users hide their checkmarks. Additionally, Musk has been pushing for businesses and media brands to pay for organizational verification that costs $1,000 per month. He took away The New York Times’ verification mark after the publication refused to pay for it. Apart from NYT, other publications like The Washington Post and Politico have also said that they won’t pay any fees for verification."
345,How to build a sales development representative strategy that will fill your B2B pipeline,['@BCapitalGroup'],"March 30, 2023","Across the dozens of enterprise tech companies that I’ve had the pleasure of working with, pipeline (the quantity and quality of sales qualified opportunities), is the primary driver of go-to-market success. While pipeline is often viewed as marketing’s domain, sales development representatives (SDRs) can be responsible for more than 60% of pipeline in B2B SaaS. SDRs are “top of funnel” salespeople, making cold calls, writing email outreach or sending outbound mail. They are important even at an early stage or in “sales allergic” industries like DevOps or ITOps. In short, SDRs are a critical part of a company’s pipeline, and therefore, overall success. Despite this, there is little information on how to build an effective organization beyond rote sales playbooks focused on topics like call volume or tech stacks. These topics don’t address the toughest questions, like where to find SDRs or how to get the most out of them. Here are four common roadblocks founders and executives face when building their SDR teams, and the solutions to find success. While pipeline is often viewed as marketing’s domain, sales development representatives (SDRs) can be responsible for more than 60% of pipeline in B2B SaaS. One of the most common questions from early-stage founders is whether to outsource outbound sales or build an in-house SDR team. It is alluring to outsource SDR hiring, as setting up an in-house team involves a lot of time, resources, and effort — and churn if it doesn’t bear fruit. Vendors offer the promise of a no-long-term-commitment stable of SDRs “ready to dial” and expensive software stacks. However, it is almost always better to build an in-house SDR organization, particularly at an early-stage company. First, outsourced vendors are rarely successful at communicating the nuances and key benefits of your solution, particularly for highly technical products. Additionally, so much of early marketing and demand generation is about learning and experimentation, answering questions like, “What messages resonate with our target customers?” or “Are we even targeting the right customers?” If you’re outsourcing, you might get leads, but you certainly won’t get that learning. In many cases, outsourced vendors will spam large lead lists to guard against lower conversion rates. This can be detrimental to your brand. You only get one chance to make a first impression and burning leads can have a serious downward effect. You may also end up with customers outside of your ideal customer profile, which then puts strain on the product, customer service and strategy teams. To control the common risks of building in-house, leverage outsourced vendors like MemoryBlue for SDR training or tools like SalesLoft for building a cheaper tech stack. Finally, be sure to hire a sales leader who is willing to manage both an SDR and account executive (AE) team."
346,Snapchat’s AR technology comes to the real world with ‘AR Mirrors’,['@sarahintampa'],"April 19, 2023","Snap today offered an update on its AR Enterprise Services (ARES), the company’s recently announced initiative focused on providing AR tools and expertise to businesses that want to leverage Snapchat’s technology in their own websites and apps. At its Partner Summit on Wednesday, the company showed partners its Shopping Suite, which includes features like AR Try-On and 3D product viewing, among other things, and announced a new offering called AR Mirrors that aims to bring AR tech to physical screens in the real world. Coca-Cola is using the tech to make an AR-enabled vending machine and other retailers, including Men’s Wearhouse and Nike, have tested the product, Snap said, noting the tech would now become part of ARES. The company first detailed its Shopping Suite during ARES’ official unveiling in March, explaining how businesses can utilize its features on their e-commerce sites and apps. Among the nearly half-dozen features included in the suite are those that let users view products from all angles, get fit and sizing recommendations based on their body shapes, and others to leverage AR experiences to virtually try-on things like apparel, accessories or footwear. Snap noted customers using the suite of tools included sunglasses seller Goodr, clothing company Princess Polly and Mongolian manufacturer Gobi Cashmere, to name a few. Snap noted that Goodr found their customers were 81% more likely to add products to their cart after using AR Try-On. They also saw a 67% uplift in conversion for mobile device users, leading to a 59% increase in revenue per shopper. Princess Polly delivered over 50 million fit and sizing recommendations and saw a 24% lower return rate when they used Snap’s technology. Gobi reported Snap’s features led to 4x conversions. Also demoed today was Live Garment Transfer, a tool that makes AR asset creation easier for retailers by allowing them to upload 3D assets in Lens Studio. The retailers can create a Lens that applies a 3D animated garment on top of what users are wearing in real time, without special assets being needed. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap Businesses access the Shopping Suite solution via a front-end dashboard and backend infrastructure where they create and manage their AR assets, build AR experiences, manage 3D asset catalogs and implement the Shopping Suite SDK. Meanwhile, Snap provides an in-house team that helps clients with onboarding and using the suite’s features. Now, Snap’s ARES business line will expand to include another new option, with the launch of AR Mirrors, announced today. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap This offering brings AR features to physical spaces and events, Snap says, allowing customers to play with AR out in the real world — like in physical retail stores, for example. The product is focused on engaging customers and enhancing the in-store experience, though it may not become a significant business given the sort of one-off nature of these types of experiences. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap Snap says Men’s Wearhouse and Nike have used its AR Mirrors in stores. It currently has an AR Mirror in a Men’s Wearhouse store to get shoppers ready for prom and wedding season and says Nike, which was the first pilot tester last fall, will later this year test AR Mirrors for footwear in stores. The company additionally cited studies that found brands using AR in stores were 82% more likely to be recommended and 85% more likely to inspire future purchases. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap Snap added it’s now working with Coca-Cola on an AR-enabled vending machine where users can step up and use hand gestures to control what’s on the screen. The machine is a prototype but is designed to blend the physical and digital experience together, the company said. "

348,"As TikTok and Coinbase face regulators, some questions are simpler than others",['@alex'],"March 23, 2023","We learned last night that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission served Coinbase with a Wells notice, a prelude to taking enforcement action against the U.S. crypto giant over potential “violations of the federal securities laws.” The company intends to put up a fight, according to its CEO. Separately, the CEO of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, is expected to testify in front of Congress this morning. The stakes for the social media service are high. The app has engendered concerns across the U.S. political spectrum, including allegations concerning data security, user privacy and potential meddling by a foreign government. The Biden administration wants the app’s parent company to sell it so that TikTok can have ownership in a different country under a different code of law. The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t want it to sell. Chew is stuck in the middle. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. That well-known tech products are in regulatory crosshairs should not surprise. The aggregated value of crypto assets is north of $1 trillion, lots of consumers are involved and Coinbase is a leading company in a market that has evolved faster than its regulatory oversight. TikTok is incredibly popular in the United States but suffers from sour relations between China, where its parent company is based, and the U.S. economy that generates a large chunk of its revenue. Even worse for TikTok, it has, at a minimum, operated in a manner in the past that has directly undercut its ability to claim that it is benign. It strikes me how distinct in substance the Coinbase and TikTok matters are and also in how we should feel about them. In case you are in a hurry, TikTok has failed to earn the sort of trust it requires to operate in its current form and should not be allowed to continue to do so. Coinbase, in contrast, is a far more sympathetic company to consider. Let’s talk about it. (To be clear, this is my thinking out loud about these issues, not my speaking for TechCrunch as a whole.) "
349,Meta tries to keep denying EU users a free choice over tracking — but change is coming,['@riptari'],"March 30, 2023","After major privacy enforcement finally hit Meta’s tracking ads business in Europe earlier this year, the tech giant has confirmed it will be changing the legal basis it claims for microtargeting users in the region. It’s still not going to ask people for their up-front consent to its data-fuelled behavioral advertising. But it will have to offer users in the European Union an opt-out if they choose to exercise their right to object — which is a first. Back in January, Meta was fined around $410M after it found to have breached the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by lacking a valid lawful basis for behavioral advertising and violating the regulation’s transparency and fairness principles — and given three months to get its house in order. Now, in an update to its earlier blog post about the enforcement, Meta writes that — from April 5 — it will claim a “legitimate interests” (LI) basis for processing EU people’s information to target them with advertising.  (via GIPHY) Legitimate interests is one of six possible legal bases for processing personal data under the EU’s GDPR. Although at least half of the available legal bases simply aren’t relevant — given the nature of Meta’s commercial empire which is not in the business of offering life-saving, public interest-based or legally required services. The tech giant had been claiming another one of the six to run tracking and profiling-based behavioral advertising — contractual necessity — but EU regulators found that to be unlawful. Meta disputes that finding — and is appealing the enforcement — but a regulator-imposed three-month deadline to fix its GDPR compliance is looming early next month so it needs to do something to reset its claim of compliance in the meanwhile, i.e. while its army of lawyers try to figure out how to push water uphill. In its blog update about the upcoming switch, Meta wrote: In December, the Irish Data Protection Commission found that Facebook and Instagram must change their approach to the legal basis under GDPR for the purpose of serving behavioural advertisements in Europe. To comply, from Wednesday 5 April we are changing the legal basis that we use to process certain first party data in Europe from ‘Contractual Necessity’ to ‘Legitimate Interests’. GDPR clearly states that there is no hierarchy between legal bases, and none should be considered more valid than any other. It is important to note that this legal change does not prevent personalised advertising on our platform, nor does it affect how advertisers, businesses or users experience our products. Advertisers can continue to use our platforms to reach potential customers and grow their business. Relevant users will also be notified of this change, which will give them additional options around how we process certain information to serve behavioural advertisements. This legal basis is used by similar platforms, and our EU Privacy Policy and Terms of Service will be updated to reflect this change. We believe that our previous approach was compliant under GDPR, and our appeal on both the substance of the rulings and the fines continues. However, this  change ensures that we comply with the DPC’s decision. In response to questions about the planned switch to LI, Meta spokesman, Al Tolan, told TechCrunch: “The new EU Privacy Policy will go live next week and will reflect the change in Legal Basis. I can also confirm that we have conducted a Legitimate Interests Assessment.” Tolan declined to provide a copy of the updated privacy policy or LI assessment report when we asked to see those — but claimed “we’ve complied with all regulatory guidance needed to rely on LI”. Many EU data protection experts, however, take the view that Meta can’t rely on LI for the tracking and profiling that underpins its behavioral ads business — and will, ultimately, have to ask users for consent in order to be compliant with EU privacy laws (which include the older ePrivacy Directive, as well as the GDPR).  One problem with Meta trying to rely on LI for a mass surveillance behavioral ads business is that this legal ground is supposed to be used for processing that’s strictly necessary (i.e. it can’t be done in a less intrusive way, such as — for instance — doing contextual ad-targeting, rather than personal data-derived microtargeting). Data processors must also weigh individuals’ rights and interests in a balancing tests (in this case to privacy and not being tracked). And any LI balancing test for Meta’s surveillance ads business would have to do some serious gymnastics to try to claim the mass scale privacy intrusion of its commercial microtargeting outweighs EU citizens’ fundament right to privacy. While the ePrivacy Directive doesn’t allow LI to be used for ad tracking; unless the cookies are “strictly necessary” the required standard is consent. So the ‘something’ Meta is being forced to do here does not look like it’s going to fix the core legal problem it’s finally facing in the EU now that privacy enforcement is starting to bite. Following the first reports of Meta’s planned shift to LI, which was reported by the WSJ, noyb, the privacy rights campaign group behind the original “forced consent” GDPR complaints against Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp all the way back in May 2018, warned it will be taking “immanent” action in response to what it described as a new “illegal practice” by the tech giant. noyb isn’t specifying exactly what kind of action it will be taking. But, in a statement, its founder and chair Max Schrems said: “Meta is switching one illegal practice for another illegal practice. noyb will take immanent legal action to stop this charade, as it is clear that the Irish regulator of Meta will again be inactive. This is an absurd game and we will stop it as quickly as possible. Like any other company, Meta needs to have a clear yes/no option for users, where they must actively say yes if they want to give up their fundamental rights.” “While some still argue that advertisment would override the fundamental rights of users, this is a minority view. We are not aware of anyone arguing that profiling and tracking at the scale of Meta just to get some ad clicks would fulfil that test. This system of using legitimate interest at least allows for opt-out, which makes it a slight improvement for users,” Schrems added.   One key consideration here is the time between the first GDPR complaints filed over Facebook’s creepy ads and the final decisions from its lead EU data protection authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) — which took more than four years — during which period Facebook/Meta got to continue the lucrative (yet unlawful) business of tracking, profiling and monetizing Europeans’ eyeballs, racking in far more in profits that it’s being asked to hand over in fines. This means — if you abandon morality and ethics — simple maths favor lawbreaking. And, following that mercantile logic, Meta’s ‘compliance strategy’, if we can call it that, appears to hinge on hopping from one dubious claim of compliance to the next to buy itself another rack of years so it can keep making money by exploiting people’s privacy while EU regulatory bodies try to keep up and/or squabble amongst themselves. That’s been the usual game of regulatory ‘whack-a-mole’ to-date. However there’s reason to believe this approach is running out of road. First off, Meta is facing other GDPR complaints and enforcements — such as a major decision over the suspension of its EU-US data flows. And as more of these decisions land and create precedent there’s arguably shrinking wiggle room for it to find routes to circumvent privacy requirements. The rules are just getting more baked in. Secondly, TikTok very recently tried to pull off a switch from consent to LI — and was almost immediately jumped on by a number of EU regulators, warning the step would not be compliant, which quickly led it to drop the plan. So while Meta is seeking to hop from a (bogus) claim of contractual necessity to a (dubious, at best) claim of LI — before which it also apparently relied upon a faux claim of consent, since it was not actually providing users with a free choice over its tracking which the GDPR requires for consent to be a valid basis — it’s hard to see how it can do something EU regulators literally just blasted TikTok, another ad-driven social network, when it tried doing that. And on the GDPR front, if the Irish DPC opts to look the other way on this compliance switcheroo despite its earlier engagement with TikTok over a similar move, it risks looking like it’s unfairly favoring Meta against rivals it oversees — which could invite a new host of legal problems for a regulator already saddled with plenty of those. (We reached out to the DPC with questions about Meta’s planned switch to LI but deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us it’s not commenting publicly at the moment — saying Meta has until next week to send its compliance report in line with the decision it issued in January.) Thirdly, unlike the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive does not have a centralized enforcement mechanism — meaning regulators across the EU are empowered to step in in their own markets if they suspect infringements. (Last summer, for instance, the Italian DPA warned TikTok against using LI — citing the ePrivacy Directive; an intervention that appeared effective at snipping TikTok’s plan in the bud.) So if Meta makes this move it won’t require a (long) wait see if the Irish DPC is going to do anything about it — DPAs in EU Member States like Italy and France can act as quickly as they like, under ePrivacy, which gives them powers to issue dissuasive fines for any breaches they identify. (And France has been busy on that front where cookie breaches are concerned — including with recent fines for Facebook dark patterns.) While it remains to be seen whether Meta will buy itself more years, plural, to avoiding giving EU users an up-front say over whether it can violate their privacy rights or not, switching to LI does come with one hard immediate requirement: It will have to offer EU users a way to object to the processing. So this means there will finally be a route for EU users to opt out of its tracking and profiling — which is a big win, in and of itself. If not still the full package privacy advocates have been fighting for. In its blog post, Meta alludes only vaguely to this opt-out — writing: “Relevant users will also be notified of this change, which will give them additional options around how we process certain information to serve behavioural advertisements.” According to the WSJ, which cites people familiar with Meta’s planning, the tech giant will offer users in the bloc an opt out of “certain highly personalized ads” — letting them choose a version of its services that target them with ads based on what the reporting calls “broad categories, such as their age range and general location” — so, presumably, some form of contextual targeting — without using tracking data such as what videos they watch or content they click on inside its apps. Meta will only offer the opt-out to behavioral ads to users in the EU — so users in the US will continue to not be offered any choice, per the newspaper. The WSJ reports that users who wish to opt out of Meta’s tracking and profiling-based behavioral advertising will have to submit a form objecting to its use of their in-app activity for ads — which it specifies the company will evaluate prior to implementation. If correct that detail also looks interesting, since — under the GDPR — the right to object to direct marketing is absolute and, as the ICO guidance notes, “you must stop processing when someone objects”, so it’s not clear what exactly there would be evaluate. (NB: Meta is also facing a class-action style lawsuit in the U.K. over this very point.) With the tech giant set to be forced at long, long last — kicking and screaming — into giving EU users a bare-bones opt-out of its tracking it will be interesting to see how many users go ahead and demand their privacy back. Where people are offered privacy a majority typically seize it — such as, for example, iOS users denying third party tracking once Apple made it mandatory that apps on its platform ask people’s permission to track them. Although a lot may hinge on how Meta presents the opt-out — given its penchant for dark pattern design.  Still, choice to deny privacy abuse is coming. And for a surveillance giant like Meta there doesn’t seem a way back from this kind of tipping point — short of a total business model reform.    "

I haven't, and… — Richard Osman (@richardosman) April 23, 2023  Over the last few days, the drama of Elon Musk & co’s handling of legacy checkmarks has engulfed Twitter with multiple large and notable accounts losing the verification mark. This included accounts belonging to the Pope, Shakira and Lady Gaga. Notably, the Pope now has a gray checkmark meant for government and multilateral organizations. At that time, Musk said that he was “personally paying” for the subscription for a few accounts such as Lebron James, Stephen King and William Shantner. But the company seems to be extending that gift to many accounts. Just Shatner, LeBron and King — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 21, 2023  As noted by The Verge, Twitter also restored verification for celebrity accounts who have passed away. This includes Michael Jackson, Chadwick Boseman, Barbara Walters, Paul Walker and Jamal Khashoggi. If you click on the label beside their profile it implies that these folks paid for the subscription and verified their phone numbers. In March, The New York Times reported that Twitter was considering handing out a free verification mark to the top 10,000 brands and companies. It’s not clear if Twitter is applying the same policy to personal accounts. A programmer named Travis Brown analyzed accounts that have more than 1 million followers and said that almost 110 don’t have Twitter verification at the moment. Actor Ryan Reynolds and Brazilian social media influencer Felipe Neto are probably the most notable names without a verification mark currently. I just checked on this and found 110 accounts with more than a million followers that are not marked as Blue subscribers, out of a total of 9,884. The largest non-Blue account belongs to Ryan Reynolds, followed by Tesla. https://t.co/x662V8nsPg — Travis Brown (@travisbrown) April 23, 2023  Brown’s GitHub page, which posts regular updates about Blue subscription, noted that only 4.8% of legacy verified accounts were subscribed to Twitter’s paid plan when the checks were removed. He tweeted that there was only a net increase of 12,000 in the Blue subscription numbers in the last week — mostly due to the company gifting subscriptions to accounts with large followings. This was supposed to be a big week for Twitter Blue, but I’ve only identified a net increase of 12k accounts, which is about a third of the previous week, and largely (entirely?) accounted for by Musk’s decision to “gift” thousands of subscriptions. https://t.co/nc1O6Nsoix — Travis Brown (@travisbrown) April 23, 2023  Verification has been a hotly contested topic under the new Twitter management. Shortly after taking over the company, Musk launched paid verification, but the move backfired and the site was marred with fake celebrity and brand accounts. Twitter is also now asking brands to pay for verification to run ad campaigns on the platform in a money-grabbing move. While the company is sending emails to various accounts about mandatory verification requirements for advertisements, it is yet to make any changes to the ads account page. Additionally, the social network is showing a shortcut to sign up for verified organization services in the sidebar of all accounts. Image Credits: Techcrunch/Twitter Image Credits: Techcrunch/Twitter Over the weekend, multiple people pointed out that Twitter’s organizational verification takes a $1,000 non-refundable fee even if the account’s application is rejected. Musk is banking on Twitter Blue being a big moneymaker for the company. However, analysis from Sensor Tower suggested it brought in just $11 million from mobile subscriptions in the first three months after the launch in December."

Yoni Assia, eToro’s CEO, told CNBC in an interview the company noticed that a lot of its users are using Twitter to talk about different financial markets. “As we’ve grown over the past three years immensely, we’ve seen more and more of our users interact on Twitter [and] educate themselves about the markets,” he told the publication. “There is very high-quality content, real-time content on financial analysis of companies and what’s happening around the world. We believe this partnership will enable us to reach those new audiences [and] connect better the brands of Twitter and eToro.” After Elon Musk took over Twitter, the company had ambitions to become a significant financial player. In November, the Tesla CEO suggested that the social network is building ground for users to send money to each other. He said that in the long term, the company planned to offer a high-yield money market account. Speaking at the Morgan Stanley conference in March, Musk said Twitter had the potential to become a financial behemoth. “Basically, I think it’s possible to become the biggest financial institution in the world, just by providing people with convenient payment options.

If you want to create your own sticker, you can select the “create sticker” option in a direct message window. From there, you will be able to select a video from your liked, posted and favorite videos, which means you can create video stickers from your own content or from content posted by others. Image Credits: Watchful.ai Image Credits: Watchful.ai Once you select a video, you can use video-scrubbing thumbnails to select how much of the video you want to be part of your video sticker. There’s also the option to add text to the video sticker or crop the content. When you’re done, you can choose to save the video sticker to your personal sticker library where you can find it again in your DM favorites tab to send to your friends at any time. Or, you can choose to add it to the sticker store on TikTok, which means other users will be able to discover and use the video sticker. TikTok notes that it only displays videos with sticker permissions, which means you don’t have to worry about misusing a creator’s video without their consent. Creators can opt out of allowing others to create video stickers based on their videos by changing their privacy settings. If you don’t want to create your own video sticker, you can browse through top, trending and new video stickers that people have created and are using on the app. Image Credits: TechCrunch/Screenshot Image Credits: TechCrunch/Screenshot Although you’ve been able to send GIFs in TikTok direct messages for quite some time thanks to a partnership with GIPHY, the new feature gives users a way to share content from the app in new ways. For instance, instead of simply sharing an entire video with someone via DM, you can share a specific part of it by turning it into a video sticker. Or, if there’s a part of a video that you and a friend find particularly funny and find yourselves referencing often, you can create a video sticker of it. And of course, just like how GIFs are often used to share reactions, you can choose from a selection of video stickers to react to a message from a friend, or you can create you own. TikTok has already proven itself as a successful entertainment platform and is now likely looking to expand its social features to get users to spend even more time on its app. Given that WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram all have stickers that users can send to one another in direct messages, it’s not surprising that TikTok is looking to expand its sticker offerings by focusing on what it’s known for: video. The launch comes as TikTok recently revamped its direct messages settings. Earlier this year, the company quietly expanded its direct messaging settings to give users a choice of who they want to receive messages from. The options are now everyone, suggested friends, mutual followers, people you’ve sent messages to, or no one. Prior to this change, only people users had identified as friends or were recommended could send a DM to each other on the platform.  "
354,"Everstream, which applies big data to supply chain management, raises $50M",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 4, 2023","Just short of a year after raising $24 million from backers, including DHL, Everstream Analytics, a company that provides predictive insights for physical supply chains, has secured a fresh round of funding. Everstream today announced that it raised $50 million in a Series B round led by Morgan Stanley’s 1GT Fund, with participation from StepStone Group and Columbia Capital. Julie Gerdeman, Everstream’s CEO, says that the fresh capital will be put toward product development, hiring and customer success efforts. “Solving supply chain challenges has never been more important, and have never received so much attention from shareholders,” Gerdeman told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Everstream has grown revenue 30x from the initial investment made by Columbia Capital three years ago and was successful in doubling the business in both 2021 and 2022.” Everstream’s growth isn’t happening in isolation. Startups selling supply chain tech continue to attract major investor attention — and dollars. Toward the end of March, IntegrityNext, which helps organizations audit their supply chain partners for compliance with environmental and sustainability governance (ESG) rules, landed $109 million from backers, including EQT Growth. That massive tranche came on the heels of supply chain security software vendor Overhaul landing $73 million and just less than a year after Tive, a supply chain visibility tools developer, snapped up $54 million in an all-equity investment. Given the events of the past year and change, it’s not terribly surprising that the supply chain segment has been robust to the macroeconomic headwinds that’ve impacted other categories of startups. China implemented strict lockdown measures against COVID-19 outbreaks. The Ukrainian-Russian war continued unabated. Inflation accelerated. And parts of Europe faced uncommonly high temperatures and drought conditions. Taken together, it’s thrown the global supply chain for a loop and then some. According to a recent survey from Capgemini, companies see disruption in the supply chain as the top risk to their business growth, ahead of rising raw material prices and the energy crisis. Supply chain resilience is now a key priority in the enterprise, with 43% of organizations planning to increase investment there. Still, not all firms have been so lucky. Funding for supply chain startups in Q3 2022 fell to $3.3 billion, down 56% year over year and 37% compared to the second quarter, according to PitchBook. Gerdeman claims that what helped Everstream stay ahead of the competition was its “big data” approach. The platform combines data based on supply chain interactions with AI and analytics to generate strategic risk scores, assessed at the material, supplier and facility location level. Everstream offers its own dashboards for data analysis, but also integrates with existing enterprise resource planning, transportation management and supplier relationship management systems. In one step of the data analysis pipeline, Everstream collects trading data from sources, including news and media articles, and applies algorithms to identify who’s trading with whom. It’s among the tougher problems to solve in supply chain management, Gerdeman says, because of the way suppliers’ names are represented, misspelled, abbreviated and translated on customs forms from hundreds of different systems. “Everstream is equipped with a broad view of risk from the component level to materials, through the shelf to the consumer,” Gerdeman explained. “We combine AI predictions and intelligence-based modeling with expert human analysis and real-world, in-the-moment insights from a global network of partners, which allows us to provide visibility to deliver a complete view of all the variables impacting a company’s supply chain, from back-ups at the ports or labor unrest to weather disruptions up to 15 days in advance.” Everstream’s other advantages are its access to proprietary data sources, Gerdeman says, as well as its “deep expertise” in meteorology. Meteorology might seem far afield from supply chain woes. But Everstream employs a team that monitors weather-related risk, including climate change and — relatedly — access to water and heat, which Gerdeman notes can inform a company’s decisions about where to build manufacturing facilities. Everstream recently expanded its ESG tools to measure commodity risks and human rights violations, Gerdeman said, such as forced and child labor in the supply chain sub-tier. Some Everstream customers, she added, are using these to ensure exports are screened against the risk of forced labor from specific areas in China, like the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. “The need for private and public sector collaboration to address supply chain challenges has never been more obvious or more pressing,” Gerdeman said. “Our customers are made up of some of the world’s largest brands. They require a solution that provides them with a standardized view of risk and disruption across their global supply chain during planning and execution, whether it’s challenges or disruptions in identifying demand drops in key markets, maintaining supply of raw materials or components, getting notice of insolvencies within their supplier network, assessing risk during transportation planning or understanding ETA deviations for in-transit shipments.” To Gerdeman’s reference to large brands, Everstream, indeed, has some eye-popping clientele, ranging from tech giants like Google to beverage, scientific and health household companies such as Abbott, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Bayer and AB InBev. In total, Everstream has more than 200 enterprise customers and anticipates “substantial” growth this year. To support that growth (assuming it happens, of course), Everstream plans to grow its 200-person workforce by 10% to 15% this year, with a particular focus on the data science, sales, product management and customer success and development teams."
355,DoorDash is adding three new retail partners and updating its shopping features,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 23, 2023","DoorDash is adding three new retail partners and updating its shopping features, the company announced on Thursday. Starting today, users can start placing orders for items at Lush Cosmetics, Victoria’s Secret and Party City. The announcement is part of DoorDash’s ongoing efforts to expand into new retail categories. The new partners join DoorDash’s current retail offerings across apparel, cosmetics, sporting goods, household essentials and more. As for the new shopping features, DoorDash is optimizing the search and discovery experience on its platform to make it easier for users to search within a retail store to find specific items that they need. The new update brings more relevant in-stock options that users can quickly add to their cart. The company is also making scheduling ahead options available to more consumers, and now with more options. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that some users will now see three options for delivery time windows, including “express” (typically under an hour), “standard” (or within two hours) and “schedule ahead” (up to five days in advance). Last, DoorDash is making it easier for users to choose substitutions. In instances when the store is out of an item that a user ordered, the company has built in messaging automation to make communication between the customer and delivery person more seamless. When the delivery person marks an item as out-of-stock, the customer will receive a prompt in the app to pick between other available options. The delivery service has been working to develop its platform to become more than just a way to order meals from local restaurants. For instance, the company recently launched a way for DoorDash drivers to pick up consumers’ e-commerce returns and other packages for drop-off at UPS, FedEx or USPS locations. Today’s announcement comes two days after DoorDash revealed that it will begin supporting the ability for customers to pay with cash for their online orders through a new feature for DoorDash’s white-label delivery solution for restaurants, DoorDash Drive, which allows restaurant owners to offer delivery from their own website or app while tapping into DoorDash’s courier network. The company says Chinese restaurants and pizza shops have been early adopters of the feature.  "
356,AWS and Microsoft in UK crosshairs as Ofcom mulls cloud market investigation,['@psawers'],"April 5, 2023","U.K. regulator Ofcom is preparing to refer the local cloud infrastructure market for an in-depth investigation, with the practices of Amazon and Microsoft in particular firmly in focus. The news comes some six months after Ofcom first revealed it was kickstarting a market study into the £15 billion U.K. cloud market. It’s worth noting that Ofcom’s consultation, which involves soliciting stakeholder feedback from across the cloud industry, is only at its halfway point. But Ofcom said that it has “provisionally identified” practices that make it more difficult for businesses to switch between cloud providers, or even use multiple providers, which is why it is “proposing” to refer the U.K. cloud services market to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for a formal investigation. “We’ve done a deep dive into the digital backbone of our economy, and uncovered some concerning practices, including by some of the biggest tech firms in the world,” Fergal Farragher, Ofcom’s director responsible for the market study, said in a press release. “High barriers to switching are already harming competition in what is a fast-growing market. We think more in-depth scrutiny is needed, to make sure it’s working well for people and businesses who rely on these services.” The crux of the problem, according to Ofcom, is that Amazon, Microsoft and Google collectively account for more than 80% of cloud revenues in the U.K., and they may enforce policies, fees and other restrictions that make it difficult for other smaller providers to gain traction. These include so-called “egress fees,” which are often opaque fees that cloud companies charge whenever a company transfers data out of the cloud and moves it elsewhere — this is often seen as an unscrupulous means to lock customers in, as the costs are typically higher than what it costs to transfer data into, or within, a single provider’s cloud. Elsewhere, Ofcom also points to issues around interoperability, whereby the big cloud firms create their products so that they don’t play nicely with competing providers — this can put a considerable resource-drain on companies looking to adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Related to this, Ofcom also says that the big cloud vendors often offer “committed spend discounts,” which while reducing the customers’ costs, also encourages them to stick with a single vendor even if better alternatives may exist. Ofcom notes in its initial findings: These market features can make it difficult for some existing customers to bargain for a good deal with their provider. There are indications this is already causing harm, with evidence of cloud customers facing significant price increases when they come to renew their contracts. From 2018 to 2021, the “others” category in the U.K. cloud market fell from 30% to 19%, while in tandem the so-called big-three “hyperscalers” gained significant market share, or remained around the same. Microsoft has actually seen the biggest growth, rising from 17% to 25% over the four-year period, while Google jumped from 12% to 16% market share. AWS, meanwhile, has fallen marginally from 41% to 40%, but remains by far the single biggest cloud provider. Market share of supply by revenue in U.K. public cloud infrastructure services market. Image Credits: Ofcom / Synergy Research Group Market share of supply by revenue in U.K. public cloud infrastructure services market. Image Credits: Ofcom / Synergy Research Group While all three of the big-name cloud players are part of its focus, Ofcom’s report seems to pinpoint AWS and Microsoft specifically, given that they reportedly account for cloud revenue spend of between 60% and 70% between them. Moreover, Ofcom is quick to stress that its focus lies not so much on competition at the signing-up stage, it’s more about how difficult things become to switch after a company has signed up. The report notes: We provisionally find that there is evidence of active competition for new customers, and that some customers are likely to have some bargaining power when first migrating to the cloud. However, once a customer makes its initial choice of cloud provider, their bargaining power is reduced, and the balance of power shifts to the initial cloud provider – most often AWS or Microsoft. Across the water in mainland Europe, a similar episode has also been unfolding. Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), a not-for-profit trade association, filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft back in November, alleging that Microsoft was using its dominance in business software to tether its customers to Azure. It’s worth noting that Amazon’s AWS is a member of CISPE, and AWS has a clear interest in trying to stymie any gains Microsoft makes on its lucrative cloud business. However, other smaller players in the cloud space, including France’s OVHcloud, have also been making noises about Microsoft’s practices to European regulators, with reports emerging last week that Microsoft was close to agreeing to a deal to placate them — prompting Google, of all companies, to accuse Microsoft of anti-competitive practices. In response to today’s announcement from Ofcom, CISPE Secretary General Francisco Mingorance said that it’s “clear that Ofcom recognises the potential for Microsoft’s unfair software licensing practices to distort competition in the cloud market,” a statement that conveniently ignores CISPE-member AWS’s involvement in Ofcom’s initial market study. “More and more customers, competitors and regulators are waking up to the ways in which Microsoft continues to distort fair competition in the cloud,” Mingorance said. “Private deals are unlikely to solve these sector-wide issues. Based on the mounting evidence, it is important that both national and EU authorities open formal investigations into Microsoft’s unfair software licensing practices as an urgent competition issue.” Ofcom’s market study is still at its halfway point, and is subject to additional feedback based on Ofcom’s provisional findings, with stakeholders given a firm May 17, 2023 date to submit responses. The final report and recommendations is expected “no later than” October 5. "
357,Substack takes a different tack to raise more capital,['@alex'],"March 29, 2023","It turns out that if you have an active customer audience invested in the long-term viability and success of your platform, you can crowdfund a venture-sized extension round. Substack, a venture-backed subscription media platform popular with writers and known for its email service, has collected more than $5 million in pledges for an extension to its Series B from its community and the internet at large. The sum pales compared to how much it raised in its early-2021 funding round worth $65 million, but it’s still real money and capital for a startup that reportedly shelved its Series C hunt. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. The company intends to share more financial data before its equity crowdfunding actually collects funds from its new investor group, figures that could shake up the amount of capital that it can raise; poorer-than-anticipated numbers could scare off some checks, while stronger-than-expected figures could help ensure that its ample pledge count becomes concrete in the form of capital in the bank.   I’ve covered the odd crowdfund before, including Juked.gg’s first and successful round that it put together on Republic; a later attempt by the same company to raise more didn’t work out, but the model has juice. Frankly, Substack’s rapid success in attracting more than the legal yearly limit for equity crowdfunding in the form of pledges indicates that the method of fundraising remains viable. For some companies, at least. Substack is framing its crowdfund as a way for its users (customers, really) to buy into the platform they use. That’s pretty cool, frankly, and will provide its active users with a stake in their own platform. The sticky bit is price. When Substack wanted to go out and raise its next round of venture capital, it had to go through a pricing process. Reporting from the time indicated that its expectations were in the $750 million to $1 billion range. That price didn’t clear, given that the fundraising effort was called off. After that, the company tightened up its cost structure and kept growing."

When The Cure’s frontman Robert Smith said he was “sickened” by Ticketmaster fees, many of us felt vindicated. The platform then refunded some fees, but scalpers are now at it, too, and selling entire Ticketmaster accounts instead of tickets. Is there still hope for concertgoers? — Anna If you are longing for a Ticketmaster alternative, you’re not alone. Whether you are a fan of Taylor Swift, The Cure or Bad Bunny, reasons abound to resent the self-described “world’s leading live entertainment ticketing platform.” Is all the hate warranted? Maybe not. Or rather, the platform might just be shouldering more than its share of responsibility. “It’s easy to blame Ticketmaster and say it’s their fault,” its former CEO Fred Rosen, who ran the company from 1982 to 1998, told CBC Radio in January. “What determines pricing is demand.” Regulators in many countries beg to disagree. Earlier this year, the U.S. Senate questioned Live Nation, which acquired Ticketmaster in 2010, over concerns that it’s a monopoly. "
359,The takeaways from Stanford’s 386-page report on the state of AI,['@techcrunch'],"April 4, 2023","Writing a report on the state of AI must feel a lot like building on shifting sands: By the time you hit publish, the whole industry has changed under your feet. But there are still important trends and takeaways in Stanford’s 386-page bid to summarize this complex and fast-moving domain. The AI Index, from the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, worked with experts from academia and private industry to collect information and predictions on the matter. As a yearly effort (and by the size of it, you can bet they’re already hard at work laying out the next one), this may not be the freshest take on AI, but these periodic broad surveys are important to keep one’s finger on the pulse of industry. This year’s report includes “new analysis on foundation models, including their geopolitics and training costs, the environmental impact of AI systems, K-12 AI education, and public opinion trends in AI,” plus a look at policy in a hundred new countries. Let us just bullet the highest-level takeaways: But the report goes into detail on many topics and subtopics and is quite readable and nontechnical. Only the dedicated will read all 386 pages of analysis, but really, just about any motivated body could. Let’s look at Chapter 3, Technical AI Ethics, in a bit more detail. Bias and toxicity are hard to reduce to metrics, but as far as we can define and test models for these things, it is clear that “unfiltered” models are much, much easier to lead into problematic territory. Instruction tuning, which is to say adding a layer of extra prep (such as a hidden prompt) or passing the model’s output through a second mediator model, is effective at improving this issue, but it’s far from perfect. The increase in “AI incidents and controversies” alluded to in the bullets is best illustrated by this diagram: Image Credits: Stanford HAI Image Credits: Stanford HAI As you can see, the trend is upward and these numbers came before the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT and other large language models, not to mention the vast improvement in image generators. You can be sure that the 26x increase is just the start. Making models more fair or unbiased in one way may have unexpected consequences in other metrics, as this diagram shows: Image Credits: Stanford HAI Image Credits: Stanford HAI As the report notes, “Language models which perform better on certain fairness benchmarks tend to have worse gender bias.” Why? It’s hard to say, but it just goes to show that optimization is not as simple as everyone hopes. There is no simple solution to improving these large models, partly because we don’t really understand how they work. Fact-checking is one of those domains that sounds like a natural fit for AI: Having indexed much of the web, it can evaluate statements and return a confidence that they are supported by truthful sources, and so on. This is very far from the case. AI actually is particularly bad at evaluating factuality and the risk is not so much that they will be unreliable checkers, but that they will themselves become powerful sources of convincing misinformation. A number of studies and datasets have been created to test and improve AI fact-checking, but so far we’re still more or less where we started. Fortunately, there’s a large uptick in interest here, for the obvious reason that if people feel they can’t trust AI, the whole industry is set back. There’s been a tremendous increase in submissions at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, and at NeurIPS issues like fairness, privacy, and interpretability are getting more attention and stage time. These highlights of highlights leave a lot of detail on the table. The HAI team has done a great job of organizing the content, however, and after perusing the high-level stuff here, you can download the full paper and get deeper into any topic that piques your interest."
360,GM is killing off the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 25, 2023","General Motors Chair and CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday the automaker will stop producing its two top-selling EVs: the Chevy Bolt and its larger sibling, the Bolt EUV, by the end of 2023. Barra told investors during the company’s earnings call that its Orion Michigan factory, which currently assembles the Bolt, will be retooled for electric truck production. The decision comes as GM launches a new slate of EVs such as the GMC Hummer and Cadillac Lyriq that are outfitted with the company’s Ultium architecture that includes a new battery cell design. However, it also puts an end to GM’s highest volume EVs and takes one of the few affordable electric vehicle models off the market. It also means the end of the Chevy Bolt AV, the autonomous vehicle version that GM’s self-driving unit Cruise uses for its robotaxis. GM brought the Chevy Bolt to market in 2016, at the time presenting one of the few EV options to buyers and directly competing with Tesla. Bolt never had the same cachet as Tesla. And while consumers did buy the vehicle, its sales lagged behind the Tesla Model 3. Two years ago, GM revealed a refreshed Chevrolet Bolt EV and a new, bigger — yet still compact — crossover called the Chevrolet Bolt EUV. The vehicles went on sale in summer 2021. GM lengthened the wheelbase of the EUV by about three inches. In all, the EUV — a GM acronym that means electric utility vehicle — sits some six inches longer than the Bolt EV. The result is a compact crossover with 39.1 inches of rear seat legroom."
361,Peacock subscribers can now stream content on Meta Quest devices,['@laurenforristal'],"April 12, 2023","At Meta Connect 2022, the tech giant announced a three-year partnership with NBCUniversal that would bring Peacock to the Meta Quest virtual reality headset. Today, the streaming app is now available on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro devices. Subscribers can get Peacock in the Meta Store and stream 90,000 hours of movies and TV shows in VR, such as fan-favorites like “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation” and “Yellowstone,” as well as Peacock originals like “Poker Face” and “Bel-Air.” Users can also watch live sporting events in VR, including Major League Baseball, Premier League soccer, WWE wrestling, Big Ten Football and NFL games, among others. On Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro, users can multitask by watching multiple screens at once. So, Peacock subscribers can watch content within the streaming app while also browsing the internet or using other apps. Plus, users will soon get to interact with the Dunder Mifflin gang in virtual reality. Later this year, Meta is bringing NBCU IP to Meta Horizon Worlds and the Meta Avatars Store. NBCU IP coming to these immersive environments includes DreamWorks, Universal Monsters, Halloween Horror Nights, Blumhouse and more. Peacock is also giving eligible customers limited-time offers. Peacock subscribers who already own a Meta Quest 2 or Meta Quest Pro can get a Peacock Premium subscription at no additional cost for three months. Peacock customers who purchase a Meta Quest device will get a free one-year subscription to Peacock Premium. Customers must be 18 years and older and either live in the United States or U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands) to qualify for the offers. The offer ends on April 11, 2024.   “We’re excited to bring the Peacock App to Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro,” said Jarred Kennedy, VP, Immersive Apps and Experiences at Meta, in a statement. “With Meta Quest 2 and Pro, you can turn any room into your own virtual entertainment theater, and now users have access to an even larger collection of fan-favorite movies, TV, and sports.” As the streamer struggles to keep up with its larger competitors Netflix and HBO Max, Peacock likely hopes the offer will bring more subscribers to the platform. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the streaming service gained five million paying subscribers, bringing the total to 20 million. However, the company also reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $978 million. Peacock has shifted away from its free offering, killing its free tier to new customers. Also, it no longer gives Xfinity customers free access to the Peacock Premium plan. Peacock will announce its Q1 2023 financial results on April 27. Meta is likely also betting on the partnership for more revenue as it reported three quarterly revenue declines in a row. The most recent earnings report showed a 4% decrease in revenue year over year. In 2022, its virtual reality division lost $3.67 billion. Meta will report its first-quarter results on April 26. In January, Meta announced it expanded its deal with the NBA to bring 52 live VR games to the Meta Quest headsets.    "
362,We tried out Canon’s VR calling app Kokomo,['@Haje'],"April 19, 2023","When you think Canon, you might think cameras, scanners, printers and such. At CES this year, the company did a stride toward the softer side of tech, taking a broader view of what imaging means. Today, the VR calling software the company showed off back in January is available to you — if you have a VR headset such as the popular Oculu… I mean Meta Quest 2. In a limited preview earlier this month, I was able to try out Canon’s new VR calling software platform, which involves a phone and a VR headset. Overall and in theory, the system is super-well-thought-out: You scan your face using an app on your phone, which builds a model so the app can replace the part of your face that’s covered up by your VR mask. It also asks you how tall you are, so it can scale your picture proportionally to the person you are talking to — a nice touch; as a tall person, it often feels unheimlich to be face-to-face with people when I’m in VR. I knew we would do the demo in a desert setting so I wore a Hawaiian shirt and shorts. Nope, there’s no way of looking cool in VR — and the removing-the-mask-from-my-face feature worked about 20% of the time.

Nope, there’s no way of looking cool in VR — and the removing-the-mask-from-my-face feature worked about 20% of the time. Image Credits: Screenshot of the Kokomo / Canon app in VR Once you’ve gone through the setup process, you place your phone at waist height and take a few steps away, don a VR mask and dive into a conversation. The phone uses its front-facing camera to capture a live picture of you, while the VR headset shows your fellow caller. If everything goes to plan, it’s telepresence at its finest, without the vast expenditure of typical telepresence systems. That’s the theory — and what Canon is working toward with its platform. I’m loving the vision, but the reality of the current system isn’t quite there yet. In practice, things are not quite smooth. In my test call with the Kokomo team, I’m rather generous if I say I saw the other person in the call refresh at about three to four frames per second. That’s not enough to make the call feel smooth, and it rather got in the way of feeling the presence of the, er, telepresence. The avatar I was speaking to was also two-dimensional, which is something we haven’t seen in VR for a while — in effect, it feels like the person on the other side of the call is an animated cardboard cutout. That, combined with the low frame rate and the haphazardness of the VR mask removal (it appeared and disappeared at regular intervals), did everything it could to ruin the immersion. I can only assume that over time the VR mask removal tech will be less Picasso-esque. Image Credits: Screenshot of the Kokomo / Canon app in VR I can only assume that over time the VR mask removal tech will be less Picasso-esque. Image Credits: Screenshot of the Kokomo / Canon app in VR The biggest praise I can heap on Kokomo is that despite being early in its technical journey — and despite the litany of bugs and early-software gremlins — I think it shows tremendous promise. For now, the team tells TechCrunch it won’t be charging for the service; it wants to learn and get feedback from early users to help direct product development. It’s hard to predict what happens next for the product; VR adoption is growing, and telepresence is a compelling use case for spending some time with your friends in VR. Right now, the tech is good enough to enable you to dream of the future that’s yet to come, but is not quite to the level that it makes sense. All of these things could change, and the most interesting takeaway from this product, I believe, is Canon’s dedication to bringing Kokomo to market and putting it in front of customers. It’s definitely one to keep an eye on — and, if you have the required hardware, worth trying out with a friend."
363,RapidAPI headcount down 82% from fresh layoffs less than two weeks after cutting 50% of staff,['@bayareawriter'],"May 5, 2023","Rapid (previously known as RapidAPI), a startup that built out an API marketplace valued at $1 billion last year, has laid off another 70 employees less than two weeks after letting go of 50% of its staff, TechCrunch has learned. An affected employee who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch that just 42 people remain at the company — down from 230 in April — reflecting an 82% drop in headcount. All of the company’s remaining workers in Europe, and some based in the U.S., were impacted by the latest round, according to the source.  Founded in 2015 by then-17-year-old Iddo Gino, RapidAPI built a platform that helps businesses find and integrate third-party APIs, as well as manage their own usage of their own internal APIs. It raised $150 million in March of 2022 in a Series D round led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. Other backers include Qumra, Andreessen Horowitz, M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund), Viola Growth, Green Bay Ventures and Grove Ventures.  Notably, CEO Marc Friend only very recently took over the role of chief executive of the company. Founder and previous CEO Gino is now a technical advisor, per a company announcement. A source tells TechCrunch that Gino “was removed by the board” and that a sale of the company is expected as a next step, although for a price “well below” the $1 billion it was valued at last year. TechCrunch reached out to ask Rapid if the latest layoffs had taken place, if Gino was indeed removed by the board and whether a sale was in the works. The company said only that it would get back to us if it chooses to comment. Last November, RapidAPI announced it had rebranded to Rapid and that more than 4 million developers used its public API hub. That hub, it claimed, had grown to among the world’s largest — giving developers the ability to integrate more than 40,000 APIs from companies such as Twilio, Microsoft and Google. At the time, it touted new enterprise customers such as ATA, Poly, Formula 1’s Scuderia AlphaTauri and Sun Life Financial. It also boasted that it had doubled its company employees in the past year — to 200. The source shared with TechCrunch that the layoffs have been “rushed and messy” with “no support being offered” and in some cases, incorrect terminations being sent out before being rescinded."
364,Warner Bros. Discovery to launch ‘Max’ service starting at $9.99/mo on May 23,['@laurenforristal'],"April 12, 2023","The time has finally come for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to reveal details about its highly anticipated streaming service, which combines HBO Max and Discovery+ content. During a press event today, the company announced the name, launch date, price, new features and upcoming content slate. The new streamer is called Max and is rolling out on May 23 to subscribers in the United States. It will launch in Latin America next and then in Europe, Asia-Pacific (APAC) and other markets in 2024. You’ll notice in the picture above that the logo is a bright blue color to reflect the WBD brand. Max also has a new tagline, “One to watch.” Fortunately, the pricing remains the same for HBO Max subscribers, as Max will cost $9.99 per month for the ad-supported tier and $15.99 per month for the ad-free plan. There will also be a new subscription option for $19.99 per month. The plan, dubbed “Max Ultimate Free,” will offer 4K HDR video quality, the ability to stream on four devices simultaneously and 100 offline downloads. Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery It’s possible — at least in our opinion — that WBD launched the plan to be in better competition with Netflix, which has a $19.99/month premium plan with Ultra HD video quality. As WBD tries to boost its revenue, the company is likely banking on enticing subscribers who are willing to pay more for these premium features. The company hinted at a pricier subscription in its Q3 2022 earnings call. As previously reported, Discovery+ will remain a standalone streaming service in the U.S., so Discovery+ subscribers don’t have to switch to a higher-priced subscription if they don’t want to. Discovery+ is still $4.99/month for ads and $6.99/month for no ads. The company also announced a wave of new features and updates coming to Max that aim to improve the user experience.   In terms of content, Max subscribers will get access to thousands of titles, from scripted HBO Max series like “Succession” and “Euphoria” to unscripted Discovery+ shows like “90 Day Fiancé” and “Fixer Upper,” among many others. WBD also announced new original TV programming coming to the service: The company previously confirmed to be working on new titles for The Lord of the Rings franchise, a prequel series for Stephen King’s “It” and a Sherlock Holmes TV universe, among others. There’ll also be second seasons of popular HBO Max shows like “House of the Dragon,” “The Last of Us” and “The White Lotus.” WBD also officially confirmed today that a Harry Potter Max Original series is coming to the streaming service.   On April 7, four members of Congress sent a letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) petitioning an investigation into the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, suggesting potential anti-competitive behavior. Democratic representatives Elizabeth Warren, David Cicilline, Joaquin Castro and Pramila Jayapal claim that the merged company “enabled it to harm workers and heighten barriers to entry in the media and entertainment industry,” according to the letter. The $43 billion deal between WarnerMedia and Discovery officially closed in April 2022. Since then, the company has implemented various cost-cutting measures in order to reduce its hefty debt load. This included the hasty shutdown of CNN+, the removal of titles on HBO Max as well as many layoffs. According to the lawmakers, about 850 layoffs occurred at CNN, CNN+ and the WBD ad sales division. WBD reported its fourth-quarter results in February, which showed a net loss of $2.1 billion, including $217 million from its streaming segment. WBD earned $11 billion in revenue. HBO Max and Discovery+ have yet to turn a profit. The April 2023 letter comes less than two years after nearly 30 members of Congress sent a letter to the DOJ regarding the same issue. In December 2021, the lawmakers warned the federal executive agency that the merger “raises significant antitrust concerns” and “threatens to enhance the market power of the combined firm and substantially lessen competition in the media and entertainment industry, harming both consumers and American workers,” according to the 2021 letter.

365,Reddit will begin charging for access to its API,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 18, 2023","Following on the heels of Twitter’s decision to restrict third-party access to its data, Reddit today announced that it’ll begin charging for use of its API. It’s not a blanket policy change. As reported by The New York Times, Reddit’s API will remain free to developers who want to build apps and bots that help people use Reddit, as well as to researchers who wish to study Reddit for strictly academic or noncommercial purposes. But companies that “crawl” Reddit for data and “don’t return any of that value” to users will have to pay up,” Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told The Times. “It’s a good time for us to tighten things up,” Huffman said. “We think that’s fair.” The move comes as Reddit looks for ways to monetize its vast array of user-generated content, which as The Times notes has been increasingly used to train high-profile, text-generating machine learning models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4. As of 2019, Reddit had over 430 million monthly active users across more than 1.2 million special interest communities, 138,000 are active. Huffman told The Times that he believes Reddit data is particularly valuable because it’s continuously updated. “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” he reiterated. “More than any other place on the internet, Reddit is a home for authentic conversation. There’s a lot of stuff on the site that you’d only ever say in therapy, or AA, or never at all … But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.” Shareholders could be the motivator. Reddit hasn’t announced the details of its API pricing yet. But the company is preparing for a potential initial public offering sometime later this year, and investors will be looking for growth in — or entirely new streams of — revenue. Reddit, which was valued at around $10 billion in August 2021, is estimated to have made $350 million from ads two years ago. That total pales in comparison to Meta’s and even Twitter’s ad revenues. Meta made $113 billion in 2022, while Twitter, despite its many controversies, raked in nearly $7 billion. In news related to the API policy change, Reddit today said that it hopes to incorporate more AI into how the site operates, such as identifying the use of AI-generated text on Reddit and adding a label that notifies users that a comment might’ve come from a bot. Reddit also aims to improve its moderation tools and the third-party bots that help moderators monitor the forums."
366,VinFast’s EV ambitions just got a $2.5B boost,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 26, 2023","Vietnamese EV automaker VinFast is getting a $2.5 billion injection of capital as it pursues an ambitious plan to woo U.S. consumers with a slate of electric SUVs and crossovers. Billionaire Pham Nhat Vuong, who founded VinFast’s parent company Vingroup, committed Wednesday to invest $1 billion of his personal wealth via a grant in the EV company. Vingroup, the country’s largest conglomerate, will invest $500 million. The parent company has also agreed to loan VinFast an additional $1 billion with a maturity of up to five years. A representative of Vuong’s said in a statement that he is donating some of his personal assets to “energize VinFast during the pivotal acceleration period to create a mark of Vietnam in the world’s electric vehicle market.” “The growth potential of VinFast has been demonstrated in the past five years,” Vingroup CEO Nguyen Viet Quang said in a prepared statement. “This is a pivotal period for VinFast to accelerate towards a solid competitive position in the world’s electric vehicle market.” The capital commitments come as VinFast takes aim at the United States, one of the largest car markets in the world. VinFast’s grand ambitions materialized not long after its formation in 2017. The company debuted its first internal combustion engine vehicles at the 2018 Paris Motor Show and later added a range of e-scooters and vehicles for the Vietnamese market. The company has said that within a year of launching, its vehicles became the fastest-selling in Vietnam. VinFast then made a pivot to a pure EV company, and while it continued to make inroads in Vietnam, it also set its sights on the U.S. market. VinFast said it has introduced six EV models, one electric bus model and nine electric motorbikes. About 3,000 electric cars have been exported to foreign markets. VinFast’s aspirations extend well beyond a few thousand exported vehicles. The company, which showcased four SUVs presented at the 2022 LA Auto Show, has plans to build a factory in North Carolina and set up showrooms and services centers throughout the U.S. The company received $1.2 billion in incentives to build the factory in North Carolina. The company also filed for an initial public offering in the United States, although that seems to have fizzled or at least delayed. The company has yet to disclose the number of shares to be offered or the price range and a date has not been set for the IPO."

Haje Jan Kamps says some investors are urging entrepreneurs to forego paychecks, but “not being able to afford your mortgage, rent [or] car payment” will have a material impact on a company’s chances of success. “As an investor in these startups, it’s your duty to help the startup get to that point in the shortest possible amount of time,” he writes. “Telling founders not to take a salary is wonderfully counterproductive on so many levels.”   Image Credits: Michael Loccisano

To learn more about what happens when a founder shuts down their own company, Ron Miller interviewed Lillian Cartwright, co-founder of ShelfLife, a B2B marketplace for wholesale ingredients. Cartwright raised a $3 million seed round in 2021, but after approaching 90 VCs in the summer of 2022, “we couldn’t raise anything,” she said. “So the first week of February, I notified the investors in my normal regular update that I was winding down the company and returning the capital.”  "
369,What happens to your crypto when you die?,['@jacqmelinek'],"April 26, 2023"," Imagine your family member or friend gets rich from crypto and passes away. Yes, you’d be grieving, but you may also wonder what happens to their assets. And if they’ve left you any, the question then becomes: How are you supposed to access them? These are questions that anyone with cryptocurrency holdings should consider, even at a young age, according to Jaime Herren, an attorney at Holland & Knight. As the crypto industry matures, one consideration often left ignored is estate planning for your assets when you pass. Given that a lot of crypto assets are held in both hot and cold wallets and guarded by private keys (among other security elements), these funds could be virtually lost forever without a plan in place. “The call to action is to do it,” Herren said. “Don’t think you’re too young to put a plan in place for your assets.” (Of course, this advice also applies to people with traditional assets.) Herren, who manages complex assets, technology, digital assets and intellectual property for individuals, says in general, most clients looking for estate plans are older. “The only people under 40 who do it are ones who have a baby. Sometimes the first kid triggers people to want to take care of them or leave things to them. But no one [else] thinks about it until mortality starts ticking past 55 or 60 years old,” she said. But the narrative might be changing. Over the past three years, there has been a 63% rise in adults between the ages of 18 and 34 laying out plans for their estate, according to Caring.com’s 2023 Wills and Estate Planning study. It’s important to note, however, that this applies to general estate planning and not planning around crypto assets. Wealthy individuals who have over $10 million in crypto assets should update their estate plans every six months, Herren said. “Blockchain asset owners move assets a lot, so they need to update their estate plans to reflect that.”"
370,Shipments of iPhones made in India surged 162% in value terms,['@jagmeets13'],"March 28, 2023","India’s ongoing efforts to boost local manufacturing of iPhone devices seem to have paid off to some extent, as the locally manufactured iPhone shipments grew 162% year-on-year by value in 2022, according to Counterpoint. On Tuesday, the market research firm said that Apple now captures 25% of the total value of the smartphone market in India compared to 12% in 2021. The shipments of locally made iPhone units grew 65% year-on-year in volume terms, the firm said in its latest report. Apple’s electronics manufacturing services partners Foxconn Hon Hai and Wistron were the fastest-growing manufacturers among the top 10 electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players in India in Q4 2022. Both manufacturers additionally led the EMS landscape in value terms. Their growth was also fueled by increasing exports from Apple, Counterpoint said. Foxconn recently decided to invest another $500 million in its Indian business to expand its local operations. Foxconn chairman Young Liu also visited the country earlier this month and met with various political leaders and officials to establish a better connection with New Delhi. On the other hand, Wistron is reportedly looking to sell its only production plant in the country to Tata Group to let the Indian salt-to-software conglomerate start manufacturing iPhone models. “In terms of overall exports, a volume growth of 37% [year-over-year] was witnessed. Further, the contribution of exports in the total ‘Made in India’ smartphone shipments reached the highest ever in 2022 both in volume (20%) and value terms (30%),” said Counterpoint senior research analyst Prachir Singh. The Indian government introduced a $6.6 billion incentive program to relocate smartphone manufacturing. It has helped attract Apple’s manufacturers to start their production lines in the country to fulfill both domestic and international demand and reduce their reliance on China. Samsung has also significantly participated in the local production push by the government to earn incentives. The decline in consumer demand due to the macroeconomic slowdown, especially in the second half of the year, has resulted in a 3% year-on-year drop in the total locally manufactured smartphone shipments in the country. The shipments also fell 19% in the last quarter due to a dip in local demand, particularly for entry-level and mid-tier smartphones. Nonetheless, Counterpoint noted that India-made smartphone shipments in terms of value registered a 34% year-on-year growth. Image Credits: Counterpoint Image Credits: Counterpoint Oppo led the shipments of locally manufactured smartphones in the country in 2022 with a 22% share, followed by Samsung. However, the South Korean company dominated the market of smartphone manufacturers in the country in Q4, as Oppo saw a 31% year-on-year decline in its shipments due to inventory issues in the entry-level segment, the analyst firm said. Oppo’s data comprises the shipments of Realme and OnePlus as well. “The increasing exports from Apple, Samsung and other OEMs drove the locally manufactured shipments in 2022 and somewhat offset the impact of the local demand decline,” said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint."

372,"DataDome, which uses AI to protect against bot-based attacks, raises $42M",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 30, 2023","Online businesses are at risk of bad bot activity, certainly more now than they used to be. According to a survey from Imperva, 42.3% of internet traffic in 2021 wasn’t human, but instead bots that ran automated routines with ill intent. Given the damage bots can do — for example, stealing content and inventory, degrading website and app performance, taking over accounts and committing payment fraud — it’s not exactly surprising that vendors selling bot-fighting tech are attracting big investments. Case in point, DataDome, a provider of bot protection services for mobile apps, websites and APIs, has raised $42 million in a Series C round led by InfraVia Growth with participation from Elephant and ISAI. That’s an impressively high figure in light of the current macroeconomic climate. Funding for cybersecurity startups dropped by a third in 2022, falling from $22.8 billion in 2021 to $15.3 billion last year, according to Crunchbase data. Beyond the cybersecurity industry, the fallout from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse continues to impact startups’ ability to secure funding. DataDome co-founder and CEO Benjamin Fabre says that the proceeds from the Series C will be put toward supporting the company’s commercial rollout and R&D efforts. “This round brings our total raised to $82 million,” Fabre told TechCrunch in an email interview. “We are fortunate to have demonstrated significant growth with very responsible cash efficiency. Truth be told, we weren’t looking to raise funds at this time. But InfraVia shares our vision of bot mitigation as the foundation for online fraud prevention, which made for a compelling case.” Fabre founded DataDome in 2015 with Fabien Grenier, a longtime business partner, after the pair made the observation that most companies weren’t able to detect and block bots. They sought to build a platform that could prevent bot-based threats, but in a unique way — one that eschewed static rules for machine learning that assesses every request to a website, mobile app or API. DataDome isn’t the only company doing this, of course. There’s anti-bot startup Kasada, which helps to fight online bots using its proprietary anti-bot platform Polyform. ThreatX develops bot defense tech for APIs and web apps, while PerimeterX uses machine learning to help understand normal behavior and shut down anomalous, bot-driven behavior in an automated fashion. So what makes DataDome different? Well, the company claims to be one of the few that analyzes each traffic request anew, in real time, using techniques like vulnerability scanning rules, device fingerprinting and behavioral analysis. The platform works with existing applications, offering features like a CAPTCHA to thwart bots. And it scales, processing more than 3 trillion data signals every day. Image Credits: DataDome Image Credits: DataDome “Think about recent headlines, like the Taylor Swift and Ticketmaster debacle,” Fabre said. “Our customers are very clear about the pain points they experience because of this … Our approach is transversal, and cuts across those aforementioned silos. In that regard, we think like an attacker, and evaluate each request for its intent.” On the AI and machine learning side, DataDome leverages several AI models to attempt to spot malicious bots. Once something abnormal has been detected, DataDome deploys a range of techniques, including data mining, to infer what caused the change. Post-detection, the detection signals are stored in a database, where they can be used to improve the quality of the detection and understand what happened during an attack or to train machine learning models. Over the past few months, DataDome’s focus has been rolling out its CAPTCHA product, according to Fabre, as well as new AI models to block bot threats from CAPTCHA-solve bots and CAPTCHA farms plus improved analytics and reporting tools. Customers appear to be pleased with the trajectory; revenue doubled from October 2021. “This is still a highly growing market,” Fabre said. “In our experience, about 40% of new customers are upgrading from a web application firewall or a content delivery network’s (CDN) basic protection, 30% are switching from bot specialists, and 30% are evolving from an in-house solution. In the first case, many customers choose us to augment the out-of-the-box bot management features CDNs like Cloudflare and Akamai offer.” DataDome claims to have over 300 customers in such industries as e-commerce, media, travel, ticketing, healthcare and the public sector. For those brands, the platform is protecting more than 400,000 domains for over 4,800 active users spread across the globe, according to Fabre — from North America to Western Europe, India and Australia. “The pandemic created a massive shift toward all things online, which in turn expanded the automated threat landscape,” Fabre added. “Before, during and after the height of COVID, our solution proves essential for digital businesses.”"
373,Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming business set to become profitable in 2023,['@laurenforristal'],"May 5, 2023","Warner Bros. Discovery announced Friday that its streaming business will turn a profit in 2023. The company previously said it expected to break even by 2024 and become profitable in 2025. “It is an important time for Warner Bros. Discovery. We’ve come through some major restructurings and have repositioned our businesses with greater precision and focus,” CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. “In fact, we now expect our U.S. DTC business to be profitable for 2023 – a year ahead of our guidance. Even in today’s challenging marketplace, we are positioned to drive free cash flow and deleverage our balance sheet, and we remain confident in our strategy and ability to achieve our financial targets.” The imminent path to profitability is a notable milestone for a company that made drastic moves to reduce costs in order to deal with its overwhelming debt following the $43 billion merger. The company not only cut back on content spending in 2022, including the removal of many shows and movies from HBO Max, but it also laid off hundreds of employees. The streaming division added 1.6 million subscribers in Q1 and generated $50 million in adjusted EBITDA. Across HBO, HBO Max and Discovery+, the direct-to-consumer segment ended the quarter with 97.6 million global subs, up from 96.1 million in Q4 2022. HBO Max’s subscriber growth was, in part, driven by the success of HBO’s video game adaptation series “The Last of Us,” which currently has an average of 32 million viewers per episode in the United States, according to WBD. It is also the most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in Europe and Latin America. On May 23, WBD is launching Max, which will merge Discovery+ content with HBO Max. Overall, Warner Bros. Discovery earned $10.7 billion in quarterly revenue, which was in line with analyst expectations. However, the company also reported a net loss of $1.07 billion.  "
374,Here’s how to stream Major League Baseball games in 2023,['@laurenforristal'],"March 27, 2023","Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season is back this week, with Opening Day beginning on Thursday, March 30. MLB Opening Day 2023 will be one to watch since all 30 teams play their first game of the regular season on the same day — the first time since 1968 when such an event occurred. With so many major league teams, it can be tricky to figure out where and how to watch the games you want to watch — especially for cord-cutters. For instance, nationally televised games will be broadcast on Fox, FS1, TBS, ESPN and MLB Network, whereas local teams’ games will air on regional sports networks (RSNs). Another channel worth watching is MLB Network Strike Zone because it provides highlights, updates, scores, standings and stats from teams across the league. The channel broadcasts on Wednesdays and Fridays, when several games are going on at once, to ensure you don’t miss out on the action. In total, the MLB regular season consists of 2,430 games. Plus, this year will be the second time that Apple TV+ is the exclusive home of “Friday Night Baseball” games. Peacock also livestreams exclusive MLB games with its Sunday morning package, “MLB Sunday Leadoff.” Prime Video recently announced that it’s partnering with the YES Network to give Prime members access to 20 New York Yankees games. No local blackouts will apply, however, the Yankees games are only available to members in New York, north and central New Jersey, Connecticut and northeast Pennsylvania. Here are some of the best live TV streaming services to watch MLB games this 2023 season:   Starting off with an obvious one, MLB.TV is a streaming package that Major League Baseball directly offers. The subscription costs $24.99 per month or $149.99 per year and allows fans to watch every out-of-market game, making it a great option for viewers who want to watch a team that doesn’t play in their home city. While MLB.TV subscribers won’t be able to watch a livestream of their local team, the games are available to watch on-demand 90 minutes after they end. Fans can sign up for MLB.TV either on the MLB website or through streaming services like Prime Video and Fubo. The most expensive on the list is DirecTV’s “Choice” plan, which is $84.99 per month. Fortunately, the plan is also the most comprehensive, with access to every national MLB channel, including Fox, FS1, TBS, ESPN and MLB Network. You’ll most likely get your local RSN as well, depending on your location. DirecTV also has the MLB Extra Innings add-on, which is $149.99 per season, and gives you every out-of-market game along with MLB Network Strike Zone and MLB Extra Innings Mix, which lets users stream up to eight games at the same time. Sling TV, on the other hand, is arguably the best bang for your buck. For $70 a month, users can sign up for the Orange & Blue bundle ($55/month), as well as the Sports Extra add-on ($15/month), to get access to Fox, FS1, TBS, ESPN, MLB Network and MLB Network Strike Zone. However, there are no RSNs or out-of-market games on Sling TV.   Fubo (formerly FuboTV) offers MLB Network, MLB Strike Zone, ESPN, Fox, FS1 and RSN coverage. One caveat is that Fubo doesn’t broadcast TBS. Fubo has three subscription plans: Pro ($74.99/month), Elite ($84.99/month) and Premier ($94.99/month). The streaming service recently announced it is launching an MLB.TV add-on for $24.99 per month. Hulu Live TV is great for fans who want to watch nationally broadcast games on FOX, TBS and ESPN. However, the streamer doesn’t have as many RSNs as it used to, so there may be blackout restrictions. For example, Hulu Live TV doesn’t offer RSN groups like AT&T SportsNet and Bally Sports. Also, out-of-market games aren’t available on Hulu Live TV. ESPN+ is home to daily regular-season games that air live on ESPN. Note that MLB games on ESPN+ may have local blackout restrictions. While YouTube TV ($72.99/month) dropped MLB Network this year, it still carries most RSNs and national networks like Fox, ESPN and TBS. The reason YouTube TV dropped MLB Network was because of a carriage dispute, which is becoming more common recently. These disputes are making it very difficult for sports fans to find RSNs across both live TV streaming services and linear television. Plus, YouTube TV is another streaming service that doesn’t offer Bally Sports RSNs. Speaking of Bally Sports, 19 of its RSNs may be in trouble. Recently, Diamond Sports Group (DSG), an independent subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcasting Group that owns these 19 RSNs, filed for bankruptcy. But the good news is that Major League Baseball will likely take over the RSNs if DSG is no longer able to broadcast them. Here are some of the most important dates to keep an eye on this season, including Opening Day, which starts at 1:05 p.m. ET with the first two games scheduled: Atlanta Braves vs. Washington Nationals and San Francisco Giants vs. New York Yankees. Note that the dates for the World Series, Division Series and Championship Series are TBD.  "
375,"With DeepFloyd, generative AI art gets a text upgrade",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"May 5, 2023","Generative AI is pretty impressive in terms of its fidelity these days, as viral memes like Balenciaga Pope would suggest. The latest systems can conjure up scenescapes from city skylines to cafes, creating images that appear startlingly realistic — at least on first glance. But one of the longstanding weaknesses of text-to-image AI models is, ironically, text. Even the best models struggle to generate images with legible logos, much less text, calligraphy or fonts. But that might change. Last week, DeepFloyd, a research group backed by Stability AI, unveiled DeepFloyd IF, a text-to-image model that can “smartly” integrate text into images. Trained on a dataset of more than a billion images and text, DeepFloyd IF, which requires a GPU with at least 16GB of RAM to run, can create an image from a prompt like “a teddy bear wearing a shirt that reads ‘Deep Floyd'” — optionally in a range of styles. DeepFloyd IF is available in open source, licensed in a way that prohibits commercial use — for now. The restriction was likely motivated by the current tenuous legal status of generative AI art models. Several commercial model vendors are under fire from artists who allege the vendors are profiting from their work without compensating them by scraping that work from the web without permission. But NightCafe, the generative art platform, was granted early access to DeepFloyd IF. NightCafe CEO Angus Russell spoke to TechCrunch about what makes DeepFloyd IF different from other text-to-image models and why it might represent a significant step forward for generative AI. According to Russell, DeepFloyd IF’s design was heavily inspired by Google’s Imagen model, which was never released publicly. In contrast to models like OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, DeepFloyd IF uses multiple different processes stacked together in a modular architecture to generate images. Image Credits: DeepFloyd Image Credits: DeepFloyd With a typical diffusion model, the model learns how to gradually subtract noise from a starting image made almost entirely of noise, moving it closer step by step to the target prompt. DeepFloyd IF performs diffusion not once but several times, generating a 64x64px image then upscaling the image to 256x256px and finally to 1024x1024px. Why the need for multiple diffusion steps? DeepFloyd IF works directly with pixels, Russell explained. Diffusion models are for the most part latent diffusion models, which essentially means they work in a lower-dimensional space that represents a lot more pixels but in a less accurate way. The other key difference between DeepFloyd IF and models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 is that the former uses a large language model to understand and represent prompts as a vector, a basic data structure. Due to the size of the large language model embedded in DeepFloyd IF’s architecture, the model is particularly good at understanding complex prompts and even spatial relationships described in prompts (e.g. “a red cube on top of a pink sphere”). “It’s also very good at generating legible and correctly spelled text in images, and can even understand prompts in multiple languages,” Russell added. “Of these capabilities, the ability to generate legible text in images is perhaps the biggest breakthrough to make DeepFloyd IF stand out from other algorithms.” Because DeepFloyd IF can pretty capably generate text in images, Russell expects it to unlock a wave of new generative art possibilities — think logo design, web design, posters, billboards and even memes. The model should also be much better at generating things like hands, he says, and — because it can understand prompts in other languages — it might be able to create text in those languages, too. “NightCafe users are excited about DeepFloyd IF largely because of the possibilities that are unlocked by generating text in images,” Russell said. “Stable Diffusion XL was the first open source algorithm to make headway on generating text — it can accurately generate one or two words some of the time — but it’s still not good enough at it for use cases where text is important.” That’s not to suggest DeepFloyd IF is the holy grail of text-to-image models. Russell notes that the base model doesn’t generate images that are quite as aesthetically pleasing as some diffusion models, although he expects fine-tuning will improve that. Image Credits: DeepFloyd Image Credits: DeepFloyd But the bigger question, to me, is to what degree DeepFloyd IF suffers from the same flaws as its generative AI brethren. A growing body of research has turned up racial, ethnic, gender and other forms of stereotyping in image-generating AI, including Stable Diffusion. Just this month, researchers at AI startup Hugging Face and Leipzig University published a tool demonstrating that models including Stable Diffusion and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 tend to produce images of people that look white and male, especially when asked to depict people in positions of authority. The DeepFloyd team, to their credit, note the potential for biases in the fine print accompanying DeepFloyd IF: Texts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. This affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Aside from this, DeepFloyd IF, like other open source generative models, could be used for harm, like generating pornographic celebrity deepfakes and graphic depictions of violence. On the official webpage for DeepFloyd IF, the DeepFloyd team says that they used “custom filters” to remove watermarked, “NSFW” and “other inappropriate content” from the training data. But it’s unclear exactly which content was removed — and how much might’ve been missed. Ultimately, time will tell."

378,"Razor Group, an e-commerce aggregator, closes Series C at $88M at $1.2B valuation, acquires Stryze to consolidate",['@ingridlunden'],"April 17, 2023","The business of being an e-commerce aggregator may be down but it is definitely not out. Razor Group, one of the string of startups that has made a name for itself as a “roll-up” startup — raising big money to acquire and consolidate Amazon (and other marketplace) retailers — is now making a different kind of consolidation play. The Berlin startup, which says it is profitable, has acquired one of its competitors in the aggregator space, Stryze Group, as part of a bid to be “the consolidator of consolidators.” “It makes sense right now for smaller players to become a part of Razor Group,” said Tushar Ahluwalia, the CEO and co-founder. “The natural route is consolidation, that is the path forward. We’re building a stronger company by joining forces. That is what you have seen and will see, and what we have executed.” Stryze was acquired in all-share deal, with Stryze investor Upper90 — a major backer of e-commerce aggregation plays (it’s one of the big investors in Thrasio) — also taking an additional equity investment in Razor. Upper90’s investment closes out Razor’s last funding round, which it’s calling its Series C, at €80 million ($88.4 million) — with other investors in the most recent round including L Catterton, Presight Capital, Blackrock, GFC, LatinLeap, Redalpine and 468 Capital. It also bumps Razor’s valuation up to $1.2 billion, sources at the company tell me. (For context, Razor Group had a valuation of more than $1 billion in November 2021.) Other acquisitions quietly made by Razor in the last 11 months include the well-capitalized aggregators Valoreo in Latin America and Factory14 in Europe. Razor has some 140 “assets” under its umbrella currently (assets can include multiple brands: its site lists over 200 brands), with 2022 net revenues of $453 million across them. Its plans are to use the acquisitions to grow deeper, and more quickly, into new geographies and to expand in product categories where it already has traction, and to tackle more regional channels to complement its mainstay business on Amazon. Razor’s M&A, fundraise and valuation bump are coming at a time when many e-commerce startups, and specifically aggregators within it, have found themselves at a crossroads. Not only has e-commerce activity landed back on earth after a stratospheric rise in transactions during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but some might say it’s actually shrinking, as the wider economic climate — major economies around the world are teetering on recession — is driving a lot of consumers to be significantly more careful how they spend money. Meanwhile, aggregators raised hundreds of millions of dollars to roll up Amazon third-party retailers in a bid for better economies of scale in those businesses, but that strategy has not played out as efficiently as many had hoped, with many pausing their rapid acquisition strategy as a result. “2022 is a different world,” Ahluwalia said, who says he and those in the e-commerce space think of it all as “pre-2021 and post-2021.” That means that aggregators who have in the past been very bullish on building their own startups — capitalizing on the opportunity of scooping up choice companies among the millions of small businesses that have been built to sell on Amazon and other marketplaces — are running out of runway, finding it hard to raise more money, and see the logic of the Razor approach and having conversations. “What is helping us in executing consolidation and become an even bigger business is that founders are facing all those questions. Plus M&A is very close to the DNA of this space.” Razor’s pitch has from the start been that its approach is very different from that of its peers, in that it has built its own technology in house: This is in contrast to a number of others who knit together third-party tools to manage and run these businesses, sometimes with some of their own tech and sometimes not. Initially, its aim was to evaluate potential targets. “We got very good at reverse engineering the Amazon algorithm,” co-founder and CTO Shrestha Chowdhury said. (The third co-founder, Oliver Dlugosch, is the company’s COO.) And since then, its attention has turned to using and building out that tech to run its myriad businesses in a better way, not just to help with product selection but to manage supply chains and other major operational requirements (and cost centers) in running e-commerce efficiently. Overall, although aggregators felt like one of the prime bubble opportunities at the peak of the startup funding bonanza, the whole space is far from wiped out today. Thrasio, one of the older and biggest of the aggregator startups, had a valuation of between $5 billion and $10 billion back at the end of 2021 when it raised $100 million. In the year since, though, it changed CEOs and laid people off. PitchBook notes however that it had actually quietly raised more funding, an undisclosed amount from CrossWork and Elevation Capital, at the end of last year. And that new CEO, longtime former Amazoner Greg Greeley, is now slowly bringing on more top Amazon alums like Steven Shure (who joined as president and CCO earlier this year) — all signs of Thrasio’s ambitions. Add to that the emergence of yet more players in the space, too: Just last week Rob Solomon, the former CEO of PayPal, took the wraps off his own move into aggregator land with the well-capitalized Kite."
379,"Strivacity, which helps companies build secure login flows, nabs $20M",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 4, 2023","Identity and access security issues are increasingly top of mind for companies. According to a recent Verizon survey, 61% of all breaches now involve credentials — whether they be stolen via social engineering or hacked using brute force. It’s frustrating for users, too; a NordPass poll found that eight out of 10 people find password management difficult. Looking to solve some of the challenges around authentication, Keith Graham and Stephen Cox co-founded Strivacity, a startup that allows companies to create secure business-to-business and business-to-consumer sign-in experiences. In a sign that investors believe in the vision (or at least the business proposition), Strivacity today closed a $20 million Series A-2 round led by SignalFire with participation from Ten Eleven Ventures, Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia, and Tenable co-founder Jack Huffard. The fresh cash brings Strivacity’s total raised to $28 million, which Graham, Strivacity’s CEO, says is being put toward product R&D, various go-to-market initiatives and customer support. “Given the response from the market, it made sense to add this investment now so we can scale up to meet the demand we’re seeing,” Graham told TechCrunch in an email interview. In their previous roles at Mandiant and SecureAuth, Graham and Cox say they saw an aggravating story replaying itself over and over. Identity authentication platforms would take months to roll out their solutions for enterprises, resulting in a poor customer experience and costly post-deployment maintenance. “It was time for a plot twist. Cox and I saw an opportunity to create a low-code solution that’s completely focused on creating simple and secure customer sign-in journeys, built on a modern cloud-native architecture,” Graham said. With Strivacity’s platform, users get access to a dashboard with radio buttons and drop-down menus they can use to create sign-in flows. Strivacity handles aspects like consent management, identity verification and branding. And because it’s hosted on a scalable cloud, it can ramp up to match spikes in customer login activity for up to hundreds of millions of monthly active users, Graham claims. Strivacity’s dashboard. Image Credits: Strivacity Strivacity’s dashboard. Image Credits: Strivacity To prevent bots from logging in and stealing data, Strivacity makes use of AI and machine learning models. The models look at customer behavior and usage patterns to attempt to identify “bad” or “unusual” activity based on each user’s history. When something anomalous happens, additional security steps are triggered to protect a user’s account from being hijacked. Graham highlighted a few privacy-centric features of the Strivacity platform, like a tool that allows logged-in customers to easily delete their data themselves. Strivacity also lets companies deploy fully isolated customer instances in the country of their choice, helping them meet data residency and sovereignty requirements. “The battle over the customer login box is invariably an arm wrestling match between security and marketing — or whoever owns the customer experience,” Graham said. “We reduce the risk of accounts getting hijacked and the associated fraud and reputational damage by making it easy for security teams to deploy modern security features without adding friction to the customer sign-in experience.” Exhaustiveness of its product aside, Stravacity competes in a crowded market — one that has VCs investing with gusto. In 2021, VC firms poured $3.2 billion into the identity management space, about 2.5x the amount of investment from 2020’s $1.3 billion. It’s likely attributable to the high rate of adoption for identity solutions. In a March 2021 survey by Ping Identity, 64% of U.S.-based companies said that they invested in new identity security capabilities while 79% of executives expected those investments to increase within the next 12 months. Graham sees Strivacity’s main competitors being ForgeRock and Ping Identity — both of which were recently snatched up by private equity firm Thoma Bravo — and Okta via the products it acquired in its acquisition of Auth0 last year. Other rivals include ConductorOne, Saviynt and Axiom, which collectively have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. To stay one step ahead, Strivacity’s adding new features, including document-based verification and support for companies with multiple subsidiaries and divisions, Graham said. Growing its customer base is a prime focus; current clients are relatively few but include the online university Southern New Hampshire University and the casino chain Mohegan. (I asked about revenue, but Graham declined to give a figure.) “The pandemic forced every company to rethink its online customer experience. Many organizations that rushed to enhance their online customer experience at the start of the pandemic are finding that whatever they built isn’t working how they’d hoped or can’t scale up. That’s creating opportunities for us,” he added. “While the slowdown is impacting tech companies, our customers are larger customer-facing orgs like travel, hospitality and entertainment organizations that are still growing strong because of pent-up demand from everyone being stuck inside during the pandemic.” In the next 12 months, Strivacity plans to nearly double its workforce from 40 employees to around 70."
380,Audible is testing ad-supported access to select titles for non-members,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 30, 2023","Audible is testing ad-supported access to select titles for non-members, the Amazon-owned audiobook company revealed on a help page on its website. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the test is very limited and does not apply to paid members. The news was first reported by Marketing Brew. The move indicates that the company may be exploring the possibility of an ad-based membership option. Audible declined to comment on any specific plans. The test includes audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals. Audible says the test applies to a limited subsection of titles on its platform. Content providers were informed of the change and given the chance to opt out of ads. Users who are part of the test will hear a total of eight ads within a 24-hour period. Audible says it has taken additional measures to make sure that ads won’t be heard too frequently within a short time span. “Audible is dedicated to continuously optimizing how we deliver audio programming to listeners everywhere,” the company’s help page about the test reads. “From time to time, Audible tests new products and services to gain knowledge about the evolving needs of our customers and partners.” Audible confirmed that it’s conducting the test in a few different regions, but didn’t specify which ones. We understand that the U.S. is one of these regions, given that the help page was published on the company’s U.S. website. The company currently offers an Audible Plus membership plan that costs $7.95 per month and includes a selection of Audible Originals, audiobooks, sleep tracks, meditation programs and podcasts. Audible also offers an Audible Premium Plus plan that costs $14.95 and includes everything available in its Plus plan in addition to one title per month from an extended selection of best sellers and new releases. It’s possible that Audible may want to grow out its current membership offerings by adding a cheaper, more affordable ad-based option in order to compete with other audiobook companies, including new entrants like Spotify. Spotify, which is largely known for music and podcasts, expanded into the audiobooks industry back in 2021 when it acquired digital audiobook distributor Findaway. Like Audible, Spotify may also be looking to incorporate ads into its service, as Spotify Chief Content Officer Dawn Ostroff said last year during the company’s Investor Day event that the streaming service was “looking at bringing ad monetization into audiobooks.” The company hasn’t shared any further details on this front since then. It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time that Audible has explored the possibility of ads on its platform, as the company confirmed a few years back that it was testing ads, but didn’t go live with them.

381,AI can’t replace human writers,['@asilbwrites'],"May 3, 2023","In the must-watch final season of “Succession,” Kendall Roy enters a conference room with his siblings. As the scene opens, he takes a seat and declares: “Who will be the successor? Me.” Of course, that scene didn’t appear on HBO’s hit show, but it’s a good illustration of generative AI’s level of sophistication compared to the real thing. Yet as the Writers Guild of America goes on strike in pursuit of livable working conditions and better streaming residuals, the networks won’t budge on writers’ demands to regulate the use of AI in writers’ rooms. “Our proposal is that we not be required to adapt something that’s output by AI, and that the output of an AI not be considered writers’ work,” comedy writer Adam Conover told TechCrunch. “That doesn’t entirely exclude that technology from the production process, but it does mean that our working conditions wouldn’t be undermined by AI.” But the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) refused to engage with that proposal, instead offering a yearly meeting to discuss “advances in technology.” “When we first put [the proposal] in, we thought we were covering our bases — you know, some of our members are worried about this, the area is moving quickly, we should get ahead of it,” Conover said. “We didn’t think it’d be a contentious issue because the fact of the matter is, the current state of the text-generation technology is completely incapable of writing any work that could be used in a production.” The text-generating algorithms behind tools like ChatGPT are not built to entertain us. Instead, they analyze patterns in massive datasets to respond to requests by determining what is most likely the desired output. So, ChatGPT knows that “Succession” is about an aging media magnate’s children fighting for control of his company, but it is unlikely to come up with any dialogue more nuanced than, “Who will be the successor? Me.” According to Ben Zhao, a University of Chicago professor and faculty lead of art anti-mimicry tool Glaze, AI advancements can be used as an excuse for corporations to devalue human labor. “It’s to the advantage of the studios and bigger corporations to basically over-claim ChatGPT’s abilities, so they can, in negotiations at least, undermine and minimize the role of human creatives,” Zhao told TechCrunch. “I’m not sure how many people at these larger companies actually believe what they’re saying.” Conover emphasized that some parts of a writer’s job are less obvious than literal scriptwriting but equally difficult to replicate with AI. “It’s going and meeting with the set decoration department that says, ‘Hey, we can’t actually build this prop that you’re envisioning, could you do this instead?’ and then you talk to them and go back and rewrite,” he said. “This is a human enterprise that involves working with other people, and that simply cannot be done by an AI.” Comedian Yedoye Travis sees how AI could be useful in a writers’ room. “What we do in writers’ rooms is ultimately bouncing ideas around,” he told TechCrunch. “Even if it’s not good per se, an AI can throw together a script in however many minutes, compared to a week for human writers, and then it’s easier to edit than to write.” But even if there may be some promise for how humans can leverage this technology, he worries that studios see it merely as a way to demand more from writers over a shorter period of time. “It says to me that they’re only concerned with things being made,” Travis said. “They’re not concerned with people being paid for things being made.” Writers are also advocating to regulate the use of AI in entertainment because it remains a legal grey area. “It’s not clear that the work that it outputs is copyrightable, and a movie studio is not going to spend $50 to $100 million shooting a script that they don’t know that they own the copyright to,” Conover said. “So we figured this would be an easy give for [the AMPTP], but they completely stonewalled on it.” As the Writers Guild of America strikes for the first time since its historic 100-day action in 2007, Conover said he thinks the debate over AI technology is a “red herring.” With generative AI in such a rudimentary stage, writers are more immediately concerned with dismal streaming residuals and understaffed writing teams. Yet studios’ pushback on the union’s AI-related requests only further reinforces the core issue: The people who power Hollywood aren’t being paid their fair share. “I’m not worried about the technology,” Conover said. “I’m worried about the companies using technology, that is not in fact very good, to undermine our working conditions.”    "

383,A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,"['Natasha Mascarenhas', 'Alyssa Stringer']","May 5, 2023","Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS.  The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here.  Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 168,243, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker. Announced May 5 that Rapid (previously known as RapidAPI) has laid off another 70 employees less than two weeks after letting go of 50% of its staff. Just 42 people remain at the company, down from 230 in April, dropping a total of 82% in headcount. Announced May 4 that it has cut 15% of its workforce, or 251 roles. This comes after its first round of layoffs, which eliminated 150 roles about a year ago. Announced May 4 that it is laying off 20% of its workforce, impacting more than 2,000 people. It’s also selling its logistics business to Flexport for roughly 13% in stock. Announced May 3 that it laid off around 50 employees — or 13% of its workforce on May 2. Announced May 1 that Vorwerk-owned Neato Robotics is shutting down, with nearly 100 employees impacted by the move. Announced April 27 that it has laid off more than 50% of staff. A spokesperson for Clubhouse declined to comment on the number of people impacted by today’s workforce reduction or the number of employees who remain at the company. Last October, Davison told TechCrunch that Clubhouse had close to 100 employees. Announced April 27 that it would be laying off 500 employees or 16% of staff. Announced on April 26 that it is shutting down its Halo Health division, effective July 31, among other divisions. The layoffs are part of the 9,000 employees announced in March.

384,"For SUVs and EVs, subtlety is out and plundering nature is in",['@bypatrickgeorge'],"April 5, 2023","Here in America, we like our steaks juicy, our tax subsidies to go to sports stadiums and our SUVs and crossovers to look as if they could venture into the wilderness and dominate the landscape at a moment’s notice. Maybe it’s anxiety from years of being cooped up inside during the height of the global pandemic. Or maybe it’s just more automakers desperate to follow the runaway sales success at Subaru. Either way, automakers are keen to tap into this profit-pumping 21st-century version of manifest destiny. The trend was on display at the 2023 New York International Auto Show, where the show floor was dotted with crossovers and SUVs that look rugged, tough and ready to off-road — even if the vast majority of those vehicles never will. Body cladding, increased ride heights, maybe some all-terrain gizmos and adventurous-sounding names (TrailSport! Wilderness! Peak Edition!) were all hallmarks of an otherwise very diminished auto show in the Big Apple. This was even true with electric vehicles, which played a more prominent part of this show than ever before. With debuts like the large, three-row Kia EV9 and the hulking Ram 1500 Rev, it’s all proof that the EV race too will be a contest of trucks and SUVs. Image Credits: Patrick George Image Credits: Patrick George Some of the vehicles on display were new debuts, like the all-new 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness. It’s a new trim level that draws on the massive success of the Crosstrek (now in its third generation) and the Wilderness trims on the Outback and Forester. The latter two, which debuted in 2021 as 2022 models, have been big hits for Subaru. “Since we launched the Wilderness line a year and half ago we have sold 75,000 Wilderness products with Outback and Forester in a time where we have been limited by supply chain issues,” Subaru spokesperson Dominick Infante told TechCrunch today. He added, “And to be honest, we are following the lead of our customers. They have been customizing their Crosstreks with lifts and more aggressive tires for years.” Now the small Crosstrek gets the same treatment too, with 9.3 inches of ground clearance (more than half an inch over the regular Crosstrek), larger coil springs and shock absorbers, wider approach and departure angles for off-roading and various traction modes to better deal with snow, mud and dirt. It starts at $31,995, a healthy increase over the base $23,645 Crosstrek. The opportunity to expand profit margins with a bit of cladding and a lift may be why other automakers are chasing this trend. American consumers have long demanded the trappings of ruggedness and off-road capability from their SUVs, even if many of them were just car-based crossovers that looked tough but couldn’t back it up when the road ended. The focus on SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks is no surprise. The American car market has drastically shifted away from sedans and small cars over the last decade and automakers have responded in kind. Data from the International Energy Agency shows that even amid sales challenges with the pandemic-driven chip shortage, SUV sales are on the rise globally. That’s not necessarily great news for the climate, as these bigger and heavier vehicles are still responsible for more carbon emissions than smaller ones. But the New York Auto Show proved how incongruent it all feels. As automakers pledge to electrify their fleets and reduce their overall carbon footprints, they’re paying for it by selling big trucks and SUVs designed to conquer nature. Or to at least look the part. And while it’s true that modern ICE cars are more efficient than they’ve ever been before and have more electrified options, the path to “going green” is through big vehicles with big swagger. Image Credits: Patrick George Image Credits: Patrick George Jeep, of course, has a major presence at the show this year, showing off the updated 2024 Wrangler with several new trim levels. Wrangler sales have shot up in recent years, and the Wrangler 4xe also happens to be America’s best-selling plug-in hybrid car; that says a lot about our love of outdoor exploring, or at least looking like we can. To be fair, Wrangler owners are certainly more into off-roading than most. And both the Jeep Wrangler and Subaru Crosstrek can more than take care of themselves when the pavement gets questionable. For others, it’s more about looking like they can do that more than anything else. Take the 2024 Volkswagen Atlas Peak Edition, a trim level that debuted at the New York show. It’s a rugged-ish visual update for VW’s midsize family-hauling crossover, which has been on the market since 2017. Here, VW clearly seems to be running the Subaru playbook: It’s got what the automaker calls a more “rugged” front fascia, 18-inch black wheels, all-terrain tires and orange “Peak Edition” badges inside and out. VW showed off a concept called “Basecamp” in 2019 and later turned that name into an accessory package that inspired the Peak Edition, but make no mistake here: This Atlas won’t be climbing many peaks anytime soon because it’s just an appearance package. Or take the Honda Pilot and Passport in TrailSport trim. Neither of those made their debuts in New York, but the cars are onstage to entice buyers who demand a bit more ruggedness (or the appearance of it). Only one of those, the Pilot, gets a lifted suspension; Car and Driver calls these packages “mostly theater.” But for the crossover shopper who sees them inside New York’s Javits Center amid various Jeeps, Ford Broncos and Subarus, they seem to fit right in. There’s a reason all of these automakers keep doing this: It seems to be working. And though it’s easy to poke fun at crossovers that look built for the apocalypse but are more at home at an outdoor mall than the actual outdoors, we do keep buying them. And we should expect to see more of them."
385,Elizabeth Holmes is denied request to stay out of prison,['@asilbwrites'],"April 11, 2023","Former Theranos CEO and convicted fraud Elizabeth Holmes is expected to go to prison on April 27 for a sentence of more than 11 years. After Holmes was found guilty on four fraud counts last year, her lawyers have made numerous attempts to delay her incarceration, like petitioning for a new trial. Now Judge Edward Davila, who presided over her high-profile case, has denied her request to stay out of prison on bail. Davila wrote that Holmes is not a flight risk or a threat to her community, however, the court has not found substantial reason to keep her out of prison. Holmes is expected to appeal this ruling to the 9th Circuit Court, but it’s unlikely her appeal will succeed. The 9th Circuit rejected a similar appeal from former Theranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was found guilty on 12 counts of fraud. Once a hot-shot Silicon Valley startup worth more than $9 billion, Theranos vowed to revolutionize the medical field by making blood testing more accessible. In a now-infamous pitch, Theranos claimed that with just one drop of blood, it could conduct dozens of blood tests, rendering intravenous blood draws moot. But despite Theranos’ massive valuation and high-profile board members, its technology never worked. Now, its disgraced chief officers are preparing for prison.  "
386,Pinterest announces multiyear ads partnership with Amazon alongside earnings beat,['@sarahintampa'],"April 27, 2023","Pinterest today announced a multiyear strategic ad partnership with Amazon aimed at bringing more brands and relevant products to its platform. The new deal will make the e-commerce giant Pinterest’s first partner on third-party ads, the company said in a blog post shared alongside its first-quarter earnings beat. The partnership is a step in a new direction for the image sharing and social media site, which has been working to adjust to consumers’ changing interests around product discovery in recent years. As demand for video platforms like TikTok and Reels grew, Pinterest’s image pinboard began to feel dated, leading it to launch its video-first Idea Pins and increase its investment in creator content. But some of those creator efforts were recently wound down, ahead of Pinterest’s last-quarter miss on revenue where the company warned also of low first-quarter sales, sending its shares down. By comparison, Amazon’s digital ads unit in the same quarter did well, jumping 19% to $11.6 billion. Like other tech companies, Pinterest has been struggling with the macroeconomic forces impacting its business, but promised it was working to adapt to the changing environment. The company also laid off 150 employees in February as it tried to reduce expenses. While Pinterest has for years worked to connect product inspiration to purchases, the Amazon ads partnership could potentially offer consumers a more seamless buying experience. Unlike on some e-commerce websites, Amazon shoppers may not have to fiddle with filling out forms, as most have their payment information already on file with the company, leading to faster checkouts. When users click on an Amazon ad on Pinterest, they’ll be taken directly to Amazon to make the purchase, Pinterest says. “Over 463 million people come to Pinterest each month to create a life they love. Brands and products are a critical piece of this journey, enabling Pinners to move easily from inspiration to action and advertisers to realize value in connecting with users with high commercial intent,” Pinterest noted in its blog post. “Our partnership with Amazon will allow us to scale these efforts in meaningful ways,” it said. The company noted the implementation of the Amazon ads integrations will take place over multiple quarters, starting later this year. Pinterest can’t yet say where the ads will appear to end users and it’s not making any near-term forecasts related to revenue impacts, noting it may not see meaningful impact until next year. “Amazon Ads is delighted to partner with Pinterest and make it even easier for customers to discover and buy relevant products through shoppable content, while also providing differentiated value for brands,” add Amazon SVP Paul Kotas, in a statement. Pinterest beat on Q1 revenue and earnings, with revenue up 5% year over year to $603 million, ahead of $598 million expected, and adjusted EPS of $0.08 versus $0.02 expected. Global monthly active users were up 7% year over year to $463 million. The company also reported a GAAP net loss of $209 million, or 31 cents per share, up from 1 cent per share in the year-ago period. Despite the earnings beat, Pinterest stock dropped 6% on higher Q2 costs. More to come."
387,Researchers develop tiny hydraulic haptics for touchscreen notifications you can physically feel,['@riptari'],"April 27, 2023","If you find smartphone notifications annoying enough already thanks to their skill at exploiting the full range of distraction options available, whether dropping a banner from above or sprinkling pox-like red balls over your homescreen icons so as to lodge like grit in the eye, you should prepare yourself for even less subtle demands bubbling into your eye-line in the future if novel research into flat panel haptics ends up being commercialized by mobile device makers. Think notifications that create a physical bulge in the screen of your smartphone — making the update icon stick out or even pulse lightly like the proverbial sore thumb until you press with your own digit to remove the unsightly wrinkle. On the less dystopian side, touchscreens with the ability to be dynamically tactile could have accessibility benefits by enabling form and texture to co-exist with the utility of flat panel computing — for instance by providing people with visual impairment with physical signals to help identify key on-screen content (paired with the necessary software to power such a use-case in existing apps and interfaces of course). The ever inventive Future Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon University is behind the research into what they describe as “embedded electroosmotic pumps for scalable shape displays”. The main break-through they’re claiming here is squeezing the hydraulics-based haptics into a thin enough panel that it can be sequestered behind an OLED screen — such as those found on modern smartphones. Their work is detailed in this research paper (PDF) — and demoed in the below video: While bulging notifications might not be the average smartphone users’ idea of futuristic mobile computing heaven, the researchers suggest the prototype tech could allow for dynamic interfaces on other types of devices so that buttons and signals appear at the point of necessity — say power, play and track progress on a music player — rather than having to fit in lots of physical knobs and dials. They also trail the idea of the flat panel haptics tech enabling the return of keyboard physicality to touchscreen smartphones. Long time mobile industry watchers may recall that BlackBerry-maker RIM, a company which dominated the mobile arena in the pre-iPhone touchscreen era with its designed-for-email physical keyboard handsets, actually tried something like this all the way back in 2008. The ill fated BlackBerry Storm, as the ‘turducken’ handset was named, combined a touchscreen with embedded physical haptics — the screen literally clicked as you pressed — in a bit to recreate the sensation of pressing real keys on a physical-Qwerty-free touchscreen handset. The problem was, er, the experience basically sucked. It was neither fish nor foul, as the saying goes. So whether lots of mobile makers will be rushing to embed electroosmotic pumps into their handsets just to have another bite at keyboard physicality in the era of touchscreen computing seems debatable. Although tablets seem a much more interesting use-case. (And, beyond that, the general idea of squeezing more attention-grabbing bells and whistles into roughly the same physical space will surely have takers.) Add to that, RIM’s attempt to implement a touchscreen keyboard with physicality some fifteen years ago was clearly lacking the fine-grained tactility needed for the tech to perform usefully in a typing context, since the company apparently just stuck a single button under the screen’s backplate. Whereas the researchers point out their electroosmotic pumps can be as small as 2mm in diameter (and up to 10mm), with each pump being individually controllable (akin to pixels) and supporting fast update rates. This suggests that a flexible touchscreen combined with an array of their miniaturized hydraulics could be a lot more dynamic and versatile (and thereby potentially useful) than was possible with the sorts of mechanical mechanisms available for pairing back in the day. So there is still a chance that RIM’s BlackBerry Storm was simply ahead of its time."
388,London’s Sturgeon Capital launches $35M fund aimed at emerging startups in Central Asia,['@mikebutcher'],"April 27, 2023","We reported last year on the launch of a $225 million VC platform from the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank, which would also cover Central Asia. In addition, Most VC launched its accelerator out of Almaty, Kazakhstan. So it’s clear these regions, for too long considered backwaters, are now finding their feet as a new wave of tech talent comes online, eager to join the tech industry and the startup ecosystem. Indeed, they are following a similar path to the wave of tech VC investment that hit countries like Indonesia, Nigeria and Brazil in the last few years. Taking advantage of that today is Sturgeon Capital, a London-based VC, which plans to invest in early-stage startups in the emerging markets of Central Asia and South Asia (excluding India). Sturgeon’s latest VC fund, Sturgeon Emerging Opportunities II (SEO II), will deploy its $35 million fund, building on its previous fund (SEO I), a 2020 vintage fund that has made 18 investments focused at seed up till Series A. SEO II will continue to invest in fintech, B2B software and marketplace business models.   Kiyan Zandiyeh, Sturgeon’s managing partner, said in a statement: “Sturgeon’s on-the-ground presence in each market allows us to see all deal flow, due diligence it effectively, and provide true value add support post investment.” Commenting on the new fund, Alex Branton, a partner at Sturgeon added: “SEO II is investing in the rapid digitalisation of some of the world’s least developed countries that are following the emerging markets’ technology playbook, proven in multiple comparable markets over the last decade. Sturgeon is a for profit and for-impact investor, with an impact strategy built on three pillars of employment, financial inclusion, and gender.” Since launching in February 2023, the new fund has made investments in Shikho (Bangladeshi edtech) and Oasis MFI (Central Asia fintech)."
389,Truecaller brings live caller ID to iPhone… but with a catch,['@jagmeets13'],"April 12, 2023","Truecaller has been a known name in the app market globally — thanks to its eponymous caller-identification service. Its active user base these days numbers 338 million, but it could be bigger: A lack of a caller ID feature on iOS has arguably held back its growth among iPhone users. Now, in an effort to expand its reach, the Stockholm-based company is introducing an update that will finally provide live caller ID support on iOS, available to people using its paid tiers. The new feature comes as Truecaller continues to see a lot of growth, but also some knocks in its strongest markets. The app has been one of the more popular ones among mobile users in markets like India where spammers target the masses. Yet the company has faced criticism over how it collects data for its caller ID service. Last year, an investigation by Indian magazine The Caravan claimed that Truecaller was “comprised of details which have been collected without consent.” However, the company denied the allegations and asserted that the investigation was flawed and based on inaccurate information. The new caller ID feature will be offered only to users who are on the app’s premium tiers (priced at a range of tiers ranging from $0.99 per month per individual, through to $4.99/month when a user’s carrier is not supported and $9.99/month for family plans, with discounts on annual subscriptions). And it won’t be just like it is on Android: Unlike the seamless experience available on that platform — users see a caller ID instantly when they receive an incoming call — the iPhone experience will involve a step that requires interacting with Siri. Nakul Kabra, product director for iOS at Truecaller, told TechCrunch that the app has had a limited experience on the iPhone due to how Apple works with third-party caller ID apps. The current framework for identifying calls in Truecaller is limited to a finite set of numbers stored in directories in Apple’s CallKit framework, chosen by Truecaller’s spam algorithm. That means that other numbers not stored locally require manual search, he said. To use the new feature, Truecaller subscribers on an iPhone running on iOS 16 or above will be to access live caller ID support by saying, “Hey Siri, Search Truecaller.” This will allow Siri to capture the number appearing on the screen, search for it on the app, then show the result to the user. The feature leverages Apple’s Siri Shortcuts and App Intents to offer the anticipated live caller ID experience. That means users will need first to enable the Search Truecaller shortcut on their iPhone by tapping the Add to Siri option in the Premium tab. The first time the shortcut runs, the user will be prompted to allow Truecaller to search from the screenshots the shortcut captures. “We have been tinkering around with App Intents for the last few months since iOS 16 was publicly launched… Previous iterations didn’t have the right experience to be used in the context of a live call. One of the more recent iterations is what has evolved into this feature,” Kabra said. Image Credits: Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch Image Credits: Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch Users with more recent iPhones, including the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, will have the option to access the feature without having to call out the Siri phrase and instead will be able to tap the back of their handset. For this, they need to enable the Search Truecaller shortcut from the Back Tap gesture settings. With this update, Truecaller has also doubled its CallKit directory size and improved its spam detection algorithm to ensure that spam, scam, and fraud calls are recognized more accurately. “This improved directory makes sure that most top spam and verified business calls can be identified right away even without needing to ask Siri. However, given the limitations of the platform, we cannot identify all calls using the traditional call directories mechanism. This is where the new Live Caller ID comes in and makes sure that you can identify every single call,” Kabra said. The company also says premium users’ spam lists will receive daily updates. Meanwhile, free users only have the option to update the list manually. Truecaller additionally introduced a commenting feature for iPhone users that lets them read user feedback coming on spam calls and even contribute with their own comments. This feature was previously available on Android. SMS filtering on iOS is also being improved with the ability to categorize incoming text messages into Finance, Orders, Reminders, Coupons, Offers and Junk categories. This categorization is currently live in India, South Africa and Nigeria and will soon be rolled out to other markets. The new set of features on Truecaller for iPhone comes months after the iOS app received a revamped experience in August last year. Since then, the company said its daily users on the iPhone had grown more than 80%. The company declined to provide details on how many users it has on iOS in total. “Live Caller ID on iPhone is the one major aspect that has eluded our iPhone app, and we are excited to finally introduce it with the help of Siri,” said Alan Mamedi, co-founder and CEO at Truecaller, in a prepared statement."

The list is a mix of familiar digital services, from social media apps to search engines and app stores — with no real surprises. The lion’s share of regulated platforms are developed by U.S. based for-profit firms, with a few international (mostly European) players in the mix, and one non-profit (the online encyclopedia Wikipedia). The full list of 19 platforms which are being designated in this first wave is as follows: The listed platforms that have been confirmed meet the criteria as either very large online platforms (VLOPs) or very large online search engines (VLOSEs), in the regulation’s jargon. (Actually, just two VLOSE are being designated at this point (Bing and Google Search); the other 17 are all VLOPs.) A VLOP or VLOSE designation carries extra requirements to assess and mitigate systemic risks attached to the use of algorithms and AIs, meaning the platforms must be proactive about analyzing and reporting potential issues related to the operation of technologies like content ranking tools and recommender systems. The EU’s idea is to use mandatory algorithmic transparency requirements to drive accountability — meaning regulated platforms won’t be able to turn a blind eye to AI-amplified harms as the law also requires they put in place “reasonable, proportionate and effective mitigation measures” for identified risks, with their reporting and mitigation plans subject to independent audit and oversight by the European Commission (with the support of a newly opened European Center for Algorithmic Transparency). While penalties for non-compliance can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover.   Risks regulated VLOPs/VLOSEs must consider include AI-driven or algorithmic harms to fundamental rights like freedom of expression; civic discourse and electoral processes; public security and public health; gender-based violence; child safety; and mental health. The DSA also imposes some limits on microtargeted advertising — with a prohibition on processing sensitive data for ad targeting or the use of children’s information. While marketplaces have some requirements to check the identity of sellers. Users of VLOPS/VLOSE must also be provided with clear information on why they are recommended certain content; and have the right to opt-out from recommendation systems based on profiling — applying pressure to ad-funded business models, such as Meta’s, which hinge on tracking and profiling web users. Elsewhere, the regulation demands platforms have clear T&Cs — and enforce them diligently and non-arbitrarily. The principle criteria for being regulated as a VLOP/VLOSE is to have more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU. Platforms were required to report their numbers to the EU back in February so the Commission could begin the process of designation. To say that some of the named platforms may be rather unprepared for this special regime of DSA compliance is an understatement: The Commission already warned Twitter last November of the “huge work” it faces to comply with the bloc’s rules. Since then Twitter’s erratic owner, Elon Musk, has only continued to channel abject chaos — such as, for example, dismantling the platform’s legacy verification system which had granted Blue Checks to notable accounts and replacing that long-standing authenticity signal with a scammers’ paradise since anyone willing to pay Twitter $8 a month can now buy a faux Blue Check which mimics the look of the old system but does not involve any meaningful verification check. Musk has also demonstrated a penchant for making arbitrary and even spiteful decisions — banning users at whim and even removing some legacy verifications sooner than others (apparently just for the lols) while also paying for a handful of celebrities to retain their Blue Checks, creating the (false) impression that they have paid Musk for the badge — none of which seem likely to sit well with DSA requirements for plain and fair dealing. Another requirement that VLOPs have a mechanism for users to flag illegal content and act on notifications expeditiously similarly looks tricky for Twitter under Musk — given it’s already facing enforcement by the German government for failing to take down illegal hate speech under the country’s illegal hate speech regime.   The pan-EU DSA also requires VLOPs to support researchers by, in the first instance, providing access to publicly available data — and later on (via delegated act) establishing a special mechanism for vetted researchers so they can conduct research into systemic risks in the EU. And, yet again, Musk has raced in the opposite direction — drastically reducing third party researchers’ access to platform data by cranking up the cost of using Twitter’s APIs. It’s almost as if the regulation was drafted with Musk in mind. But of course its drafting long predates the billionaire shit-poster’s tenure at Twitter. While the DSA certainly has its critics, the prospect of a broader backlash against the EU’s approach to updating its digital rulebook seems rather less likely than it might have been had Musk not taken his accelerated wrecking ball to Twitter over the past half year or so. In other words, suddenly the prospect of responsible, non-arbitrary management being a requirement that’s imposed on major platforms start to look kind of necessary/prescient. There is still a grace period before these larger platforms are expected to be compliant with the DSA — but it’s now just a matter of months: Firms that have been designated VLOPs/VLOSEs have four months to comply with obligations under the DSA — which includes publishing their first risk assessments — so the 19 listed services (and dozen companies plus one non-profit) face a busy summer ahead if they’re to meet the August 25 compliance deadline without breaking a sweat. Twitter certainly has its work cut out if it’s to avoid a world of regulatory pain falling on it in the EU — coupled with the existential risk, were Musk were to opt to keep flouting the rules, of a regional shutdown being imposed. (Albeit, no political body is going to want to be the one ordering a Twitter shutdown so there would likely be an extended showdown of financial enforcements prior to such a terminal step.) VLOPs/VLOSEs must also comply with the general provisions of the DSA, which will apply more broadly to digital services and smaller platforms from early next year, placing obligations on how they must respond to reports of illegal content, as well as in areas like notice and action mechanisms and complaint handling, in addition to transparency obligations and plenty more. While the first wave of VLOPs/VLOSEs don’t yet number 20 more could be coming: The Commission has suggested (via Politico) there could be a second batch of VLOPs/VLOSE designations in the next few weeks as it said it will be conducting checks on some other platforms which told it they do not meet the criteria in order to confirm whether that’s the case. One type of large digital service that’s currently missing from the list of designations is adult content. Asked about this during a briefing with journalists, a Commission official confirmed it is engaging with a number of adult content services but declined to specify which platforms it’s seeking more information from at this stage as regards their self declared user numbers. They added the idea is to better understand the methodologies being used for calculating regional usage — saying adult sites that have declared figures to the Commission are largely claiming usage is below the 45M monthly actives threshold. The EU’s executive declined to provide details of any other platforms it’s looking at for possible designation. However, earlier today, Politico reported remarks by internal market commissioner Thierry Breton which suggests Pornhub is one adult platform that’s being looked at in Brussels as a possible addition to the VLOPs list, along with Airbnb, Spotify and Telegram. While bounded messaging apps are not obviously in scope of the platform component of the regulation — hence (presumably) the lack of a designation for Meta-owned WhatsApp — a Commission official said the DSA recognizes that messenger services may be architected in such a way that they could be considered platforms, i.e. if content can reach a potentially unlimited number of users. Telegram’s app, for instance, includes a social media-style channels feature which lets users broadcast content to large numbers of subscribers. However the company has so far reported a lower level of regional users to the EU than the VLOP threshold (~33 million). And a Commission official told TechCrunch it is in the process of following up to understand how the platform arrived at this figure. While it remains to be seen how many extra VLOPs may be named in the coming weeks, where designations have been made the Commission said it will be engaging with all the platforms to assess their readiness for compliance in the coming months. It added that it will be paying particular attention to child safety by asking companies to prioritize sharing information about how they are preparing to ensure they are taking steps to protection minors online. Here it also remains to be seen what that might mean in practical terms. But it could, for example, encourage designated platforms to apply tougher age assurance measures — or even adopt hard-stop age verification technologies — in a bid to shrink their compliance risks in a stated priority area for EU regulators. In additional remarks, the Commission confirmed that no platforms are falling into a non-responsive/non-cooperative category as yet — with official saying all have been engaging with its overtures so far. But it will be interesting to see whether early cooperation keeps up (or not). And, indeed, whether the Commission gets the level of required detail for it to be able to smoothly and effectively carry out the intended oversight of platform power. There are some early signs that self reporting will throw curve balls for regulators: Ecommerce marketplace Zalando, for instance, reported two sets of usage numbers to the Commission — one of which was below the threshold for being designated and which it apparently argued for (with the Commission taking the opposite view and confirming the ecommerce marketplace as a VLOP). Commission officials also noted that Apple recently updated its self reported numbers in a way that breaks down usage for its App Store per device. Again, though, the EU’s executive is treating it a single platform for the purposes of the DSA — arguing that Apple’s content moderation policies are essentially the same regardless of where its App Store is being accessed. During the briefing, the Commission reiterated another detail we reported on earlier: That OpenAI’s ChatGPT is not itself currently considered a platform, under the DSA definition — and will be more directly regulated under the bloc’s incoming AI Act (so not for likely a couple of years) — however the EU is stipulating that generative AI technologies could end up being regulated indirectly under the DSA. Such as if a regulated search engine (like Bing; which is now confirmed as a VLOSE) incorporates the tech into its service. That would then trigger requirements on Bing’s owner, Microsoft, to ensure it is robustly assessing systemic risks of integrating generative AI — such as the embedded tendency for these chatbots to hallucinate when they lack information to provide a correct answer, with the risk they end up amplifying disinformation in search results say. So while the regulation was clearly not drafted with the latest AI hype in mind, it could apply some guardrails on major platforms’ use of the tech from as soon as this fall. What about when we might seen the first DSA enforcements landing on rule-breaking VLOPs/VLOSEs? (And Twitter would be the obvious early bet for inviting a world of pain.) There’s no official word form the Commission on when (or where) orders and/or penalties might start to land, beyond the technical compliance deadline of late August/September. Although officials point out that the designation step itself unlocks what they couch as wide-ranging investigatory powers — so EU regulators are sending an early warning shot that they already armed with tools to start digging into issues of particular concern for the 19 listed platforms. The bloc is also keen to point out that certain algorithmic transparency requirements will, ultimately, apply to all digital services that get regulated under the DSA — not just the larger subset of VLOPs/VLOSE — from early next year. Although oversight on those smaller services will fall to Member State level bodies, rather than the Commission itself. Asked if it’s getting much international inbound over the DSA, as regulators in other jurisdictions consider how to tackle platform power, a Commission official said there has already been plentiful interest — so much so they said a dedicated team has been set up to respond to international enquiries. At the same time, the Commission said it’s keen to avoid what it referred to as “zombie DSAs” popping up elsewhere in countries that lack a foundational fundamental and/or human rights framework to build on. This report was updated with additional detail following a Commission technical briefing on the VLOPs/VLOSE designations We also updated with a correction after the Commission initially misstated Amazon Marketplace as designated; in fact it’s Amazon Store that’s been named a VLOP    "
391,Accounting automation startup Trullion lands $15M investment,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 19, 2023","Isaac Heller and Amir Boldo spent over ten years in finance across private equity-backed and pre-IPO companies. At these firms, they dealt with CFOs who wanted to save money by consolidating manual processes and reducing the cost of audits — in part by modernizing their sprawling software tooling. It’s their experiences with CFOs that led Heller and Boldo to co-found Trullion, an accounting software platform that connects corporate controllers, CFOs and external auditors on a single platform, offering a unified source of truth for financial leaders — if the sales pitch is to be believed, at least. “Trullion is and always has been an application layer software-as-a-service platform, leveraging open source AI libraries while building proprietary processing to unlock these accounting data sets and libraries,” Heller, Trullion’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “CFOs can save significant money by consolidating manual processes and reducing cost of audit. Auditors, meanwhile, can modernize their toolset and reduce significant labor costs and error rate.” There’s a strong desire to modernize in accounting, it seems. An IBM poll names accounts payable as one of the most automatable business processes, but a whopping 38% of those responding say that their teams spend more than 25% of their total time on manual tasks. In large finance teams — for example, those with more than 25 members — the number is even higher, at 44%. And for a sizable minority (11%), manual tasks take up more than half of their team’s time. Trullion — which offers an array of lease accounting, “revenue recognition,” and audit automation tools — can extract data from lease contracts algorithmically, generating “audit-ready” reports for financial stakeholders. The platform also connects and manages customer relationship management software and billing and contract data, providing a dashboard with data sources in one place. Beyond this, Trullion lets customers set product and pricing accounting strategies with automated workflows, which include preset revenue recognition rules. Managers can generate revenue forecasts or a full audit log and deliver ad hoc portal access to auditors. “Trullion ingests structured and unstructured data and automates corporate accounting workflows based on generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards rules,” Heller went on to explain. “The current ecosystem is static enterprise resource platform databases (e.g., Oracle, SAP) and service-oriented auditors. Trullion is a pioneer in the early wave of AI-powered accounting platforms.” Is Trullion truly a pioneer? That’s up for debate. Rivals in the AI-powered accounting software space include Docyt, which has raised $1.5 million for its platform focused on collecting financial data, digitizing receipts, and performing categorization and reconciliation. Vic.ai — a startup that closed a $52 million tranche late last December — offers software to automate common accounting processes. There’s also Roger, a well-funded accounting automation module used to automate financial processes such as paying bills, doing approvals, scanning receipts, ensuring compliance and bookkeeping. But to its credit, Trullion has substantial venture backing behind it, having raised $15 million from its initial Series A round led by Third Point. Today, the company secured an additional $15 million in a round led by StepStone Group with participation from Aleph, Third Point and Greycroft. In a press release, aStepStone group partner said: “It’s a great company at a critical time in the accounting world. We believe this is the right time to get on board. The financial industry needs powerful, cost-effective technology that can automate critical processes and minimize risk. Companies are also discovering that AI and accounting automation [are] essential to keeping up with financial standards.” There’s truth to that. According to a March survey by Intuit, 48% of accountants plan to invest in automation tools and AI over the next 12 months. Another, separate recent report found that 59% of small businesses — perhaps optimistically — don’t think that they’ll need an accountant in 10 years’ time thanks to automation. Labor-saving potential aside, startups in the accounting automation space have done quite well in terms of attracting venture investment over the past several years. As per PitchBook (via the Wall Street Journal), AI-powered accounting software firms amassed $233.3 million in venture capital between January 2022 and the end of March 2022, surpassing the $210.2 million in funding for all of 2021. Heller claims that Trullion has over 1,000 customers and 5,000 users. Trullion, based in New York and founded in 2020, has raised $33.5 million to date. Heller says that the plan is to grow the workforce from around 50 people to over 80 by the end of the year."
392,"Snap announces tests of sponsored links in My AI, new ad products for Spotlight and Stories",['@sarahintampa'],"May 2, 2023","After Snap’s stock took a hit from its weak first-quarter earnings, the company today made its pitch to advertisers at IAB’s NewFronts where it introduced new ad products and opportunities. Here, Snap’s new President of Americas Rob Wilk, previously Microsoft’s head of Advertising, and Chief Creative Officer Colleen DeCourcy, spoke about a test that allowed Snap partners to leverage its new AI feature, My AI, to place sponsored links in front of users. Snap also announced new ad slots, including the option to reserve the first video ad seen in Snapchat’s Friend Stories and the ability to advertise within its TikTok-like Spotlight feature. The announcements come at a key time for Snap’s ad business, which saw its sales fall for the first time as a public company, despite a 15% year-over-year increase in Snapchat users to 383 million. The tech industry’s first-quarter results made clear that the advertising rebound that had boosted Meta during Q1 was not yet benefiting the wider social app ecosystem. Snap wasn’t alone in feeling those impacts — Google’s YouTube business also saw its ad revenue decline by nearly 3% in the quarter. By opening up new ad products to marketers, Snap has the opportunity to drive revenue increases as it finds more places to insert ads into its mobile app. While many of the ad slots Snap announced today were more traditional placements, one of its announcements stood out. At the event, the company talked about how Snap could use its new AI feature to put sponsored links in front of users — something Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had teased during earnings. My AI, which just rolled out to the wider Snapchat user base last month, can now suggest Lenses, Places from Snap Map and, soon, will be able to send a generative Snap back to Snapchat+ subscribers, in addition to having text-based conversations with users. Today, the company confirmed it has begun testing sponsored links in conversations with My AI that would connect users with partners relevant to their conversation. For instance, if a Snapchat user asked where to have dinner, My AI could return a link sponsored by a local restaurant or a food delivery app. If a user was talking about a weekend trip, My AI could return a sponsored link from an airline or hotel. Or if a user was talking about a video game, users might receive a link to a similar game from a local retailer. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap Snap says it’s still in an early experimental stage with this feature and wants to make sponsored links as useful as possible. It also notes that the learnings from AI could introduce mobile video powered by conversational intent to Snapchat users for the first time and noted how users’ conversations with the AI would help Snap to serve more relevant content across its app, including in areas like Stories and Spotlight. In other words, it sounds like what users talk to the AI about could then change the experience of what they see elsewhere in the app. To aid with this, Snap informs users that it’s saving their AI conversations until the user manually deletes them. It’s worth pointing out how quickly Snap is running with the AI feature’s addition. The company just over a month ago said it was still seeking qualified AI experts to join its Safety Advisory Board. It also launched the AI product to global users before introducing parental controls — though it says those are coming. Meanwhile, Snapchat users have been panning the AI with one-star reviews amid complaints that the feature can’t be removed from their Chat tab without paying for a subscription.   Other Snap announcements today involved Spotlight, its TikTok clone, which launched in 2020. Snapchat began testing ads within the product a year ago and, during last week’s earnings, Spiegel said Spotlight now reaches 350 million monthly active users — a figure that’s up 170% year-over-year. Now, the company is opening up Spotlight to global advertisers, it said at NewFronts. Spotlight ads will initially be served as automatic placements with the service and advertisers will be able to manage those via the Snapchat Ads Manager. Of course, there’s a risk with buying ad slots next to any user-generated content, but Snap says it moderates Spotlight content before it reaches a wider audience, which reduces the chance that marketers’ content would appear alongside hate speech or any harmful content. In addition, Snap introduced a new takeover ad product called “First Story,” which lets advertisers reserve the first Snap Ad (the video ad slot between Friend Stories), that users would see. The company compared the product, which it said was in high demand, to existing offerings like First Commercial and First Lens, which also let advertisers reserve the first spot in other parts of Snapchat’s app. The potential of being first in Friend Stories means a marketer is more likely to reach users before they exit. In the U.S., Snap says the potential daily reach is over 50 million. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap The First Story ad placements are launching today globally, and Warner Bros. is the first client. It will be using the ad slot for marketing the upcoming feature, “The Flash.” The company also today announced it’s making it easier for brands to work with Snap creators through Snap Star Collab Studio in the U.S., its service that helps brands source, partner and drive results with Snap Stars, as it calls its top creators and other public figures on the app. The new Studio will aid partnerships by connecting brands with preferred production partners — Studio71, Beeline by Brat TV, Influential and Whalar — to create and execute their sponsored Stories and creative. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap Over the course of the year, Snap will also expand its API and introduce additional tools for paid amplification, which will help brands’ creative reach more users. Snap also announced a range of new content partnerships at today’s event, including plans to work with the Women’s World Cup, which joins its existing partners, NFL, NBA and WNBA in the sports realm. Women’s World Cup will bring exclusive content to Snapchat’s Stories, Spotlight and Camera for its upcoming tournament, the company says. “Snapchat is all about real relationships, and where over 750 million people come every month to build connections and have fun with friends, families and their favorite creators,” Wilk said. “We’re thrilled to share at NewFronts how those real relationships drive real influence for brands as we announce new innovations and features across Stories, Spotlight, Creators, My AI and more.”"
393,"Replit, the web-based IDE developing a GitHub Copilot competitor, raises $100M",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 27, 2023","Investors continue to pump money into generative AI tech. Case in point, Replit, an IDE startup developing a code-generating AI-powered tool called Ghostwriter, this week raised nearly $100 million ($97.4 million) at a $1.16 billion post-money valuation. Andreessen Horowitz led the round — a Series B extension — with participation from Khosla Ventures, Coatue, SV Angel, Y Combinator, Bloomberg Beta, Naval Ravikant, ARK Ventures and Hamilton Helmer. “We are relentless in our mission to empower a billion software developers,” Replit founder and CEO Amjad Masad said in a statement, adding that the new funds — which bring Replit’s total raised to over $200 million — will be put toward further developing the core product experience, expanding Replit’s cloud services and “driving innovation” in AI. “AI has already brought that future closer,” Masad continued. “We look forward to expanding our offerings for professional developers.” Based in San Francisco, Replit was co-founded by programmers Amjad Masad, Faris Masad and designer Haya Odeh in 2016. Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at Yahoo and Facebook, where he built software development tooling. Replit offers a web-based IDE for software development. Image Credits: Replit Replit offers a web-based IDE for software development. Image Credits: Replit Replit offers an online, collaborative IDE that supports a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Go and C++. With Replit, users can share a workspace with one or many users and see real-time edits across files, message each other and debug code together. Beyond that, users can share projects, ask for help, learn from tutorials and use templates. But perhaps its headlining feature is Ghostwriter, a suite of features powered by an AI model trained on publicly available code. Ghostwriter — much like GitHub’s Copilot — can make suggestions and explain code, considering what users type and other context from their accounts, like the programming languages they’re using. Ghostwriter appears to be the driver behind Replit’s recent explosive growth, leading to a partnership with Google Cloud and a user base eclipsing 22 million developers. But like all generative AI tools, it comes with risks — and potentially legal consequences that have yet to fully play out in the courts. Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are being sued in a class action lawsuit that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot to regurgitate sections of licensed code without providing credit. Liability aside, some legal experts have suggested that AI like Copilot could put companies at risk if they were to unwittingly incorporate copyrighted suggestions from the tool into their production software. It’s unclear whether Ghostwriter, too, was trained on licensed or copyrighted code. But Replit does note that the code Ghostwriter suggests might contain “incorrect, offensive or otherwise inappropriate” strings. That includes insecure code. According to a recent study out of Stanford, software engineers who use code-generating AI systems are more likely to cause security vulnerabilities in the apps they develop. While the study didn’t look at Replit specifically, it stands to reason that developers who use it would fall victim to the same. Replit has its work cut out for it, that’s all to say."

395,Workera doubles down on AI for upskilling with $23.5M infusion,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 23, 2023","Workera, an upskilling platform geared toward enterprise customers, today announced that it raised $23.5 million in a Series B round led by Jump Capital with participation from existing investors NEA, Owl Ventures, the AI Fund and Sozo Ventures. The company’s CEO, Kian Katanforoosh, says that the fresh capital will be put toward expanding its product offerings and growing the size of its developer team. Upskilling, or helping employees develop new skills to advance their careers, is increasingly of interest to employers as macroeconomic pressures make recruiting a challenge. According to a 2022 PwC survey, 40% of companies are actively upskilling as they look to automate or enhance work through tech. VCs have taken note of the opportunity, investing billions into an assortment of companies in the skilling space over the past year. Workera is an unabashed beneficiary of the boom. “The technology landscape is constantly evolving, and new technologies emerge regularly,” Katanforoosh told TechCrunch in an email interview. “That is why I expect enterprises to increase their spend on upskilling and retaining their employees to build technology skills like AI. The half-life of skills is also the lowest it has ever been, so reinvention is the new norm for employees in the enterprise.” Before launching Workera, Katanforoosh and Workera’s chairman, Andrew Ng, taught AI classes at Stanford and DeepLearning.ai, Ng’s e-learning venture. (Ng previously led one of Google’s AI research divisions, Google Brain, and briefly served as VP and chief scientist at Baidu.) Katanforoosh says he came to realize that people weren’t starved for upskilling content — quite the contrary — but were instead missing the guidance and mentorship necessary to increase their skills. “Equitable learning has always been close to my heart as my parents were students during the 1970s revolution in Iran, and were unable to follow through on their educational and career dreams,” Katanforoosh said. “When I began teaching AI at Stanford, I was motivated to research how we can measure people’s skills accurately using modern technologies.” Workera, which opened for business in 2020, is Katanforoosh’s attempt to put this into practice by measuring skills in the workplace and offering personalized learning. With its product, employees get role- and goal-specific learning plans, while companies have the ability to measure skills and create custom upskilling plans. That’s no different than many of the skilling platforms on the market, like GrowthSpace, Scaler and 5Mins. But Katanforoosh claims what makes Workera different is its data science-forward approach. Using a “skills dataset” with millions of measurements across over 7,000 skills to train AI algorithms, Workera claims to be able to understand the relationship between skills and measure more skills in less time by inferring whether someone has a skill or not. “We can measure a small number of carefully selected skills and iteratively update our predictions over an entire graph of skills,” Katanforoosh said. “Today, we can measure roughly 50 skills in one-and-a-half hours and use it to confidently predict between 200 and 500 skills, which is unprecedented.” Just how accurate those predictions are is another matter, but Workera, regardless, is all-in on AI. The platform uses generative AI (no word if it’s GPT-4) to create questions for skills assessments — they’re vetted by human moderators before they make their way onto the platform, Katanforoosh says. And it also taps AI to summarize information about a skill for users who have just enough proficiency such that a full course wouldn’t make sense.  Later this year, Workera plans to launch a skills and assessment authoring platform embedded with AI tech to automate the process of creating new assessments. “C-suite leaders have long relied on self-reported methods to analyze the skills of their workforce,” Katanforoosh continued. “Workera disrupts this model of skills intelligence by using AI to generate [richer] skill signals. A richer skill assessment experience with more frequent check-ins gives leaders even better ongoing measurement of their workforce’s skills.” Katanforoosh wouldn’t reveal the size of Workera’s customer base or annual recurring revenue. But he did disclose that Samsung, Siemens Energy, the U.S. Air Force and Belcorp are among the company’s current crop of clients. “We’ve been fortunate to secure a sizable capital round amid a difficult environment — largely owing to our success this far and growing roster of Fortune 500 clients,” Katanforoosh said. “The pandemic and the current tech market have forced companies to reassess their operating costs, look internally to develop employees, and fill skill gaps in their business. This climate presents a market opportunity for us to drive increased sales of our precision upskilling solution as enterprises look to intelligently invest in and support their talent.”"
396,Vesey Ventures closes on $78M debut fund to back early-stage fintech startups,['@bayareawriter'],"April 20, 2023","After working together for nearly one decade, three former managing directors of Amex Ventures in early 2022 branched out to form their own fintech-focused venture firm, Vesey Ventures. The trio had made early investments in more than 50 fintech companies, including the likes of Stripe, Plaid, Melio and Trulioo. During that time, they also helped engineer over 100 partnerships between startups and financial services institutions. Their goal was to take that 10 years of experience investing through the venture capital arm of one of the world’s largest credit card companies, and apply it firsthand to new early-stage investments — but with a twist. The firm says its intent is to go beyond term sheets to issuing bespoke “Strategy Sheets,” which outline how Vesey Ventures aims to leverage its network “to act as a company’s first business development team.” In other words, it wants to invest in early-stage fintech and enabling technology companies “where opportunities for early partnerships with financial incumbents exist.” And today, the firm — formed by founding partners and friends Dana Eli-Lorch, Lindsay Fitzgerald and Julia Huang, who all left AMEX Ventures at the same time in late 2021 — has announced the closure of its $78 million debut fund. They named the firm Vesey Ventures after the street where American Express has its headquarters in New York. (They declined to say whether Amex is a limited partner in the new fund.) Vesey’s self-described mission is to back companies “transforming financial services” at the seed to Series B stages. It plans to invest $1.5 million to $3 million as initial checks, and larger amounts for follow-ons. Based in the United States and Israel, the fund has so far backed five startups, including Coast, Cyrus, Grain, Equi and Proper. Vesey defines fintech in its broadest sense — meaning that it invests outside of traditional categories of financial services such as consumer and B2B, said Eli-Lorch in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. It also looks at vertical software, embedded fintech, the future of commerce and the infrastructure layer — basically, cybersecurity, risk and compliance, or, as Eli-Lorch describes it, “all that back office operations of financial services.” “Another lens that we take is basically any type of technology software innovation that sells into financial services, meaning either financial institutions or fintechs,” she said.  The founding partners all agreed on one thing when starting the new firm: that it was clear that startups with better business development strategies had better outcomes. “And that’s ultimately the insight that we built a thesis on,” said Fitzgerald. “In this industry, this development is not a ‘nice to have,’ it is a ‘need to have.’ ” “The traditional corporate VC model can be limiting, though, so we saw an opportunity,” she added. “We took the best of what was clearly working — business development, our team, our network — including other VCs and angels, and expanded on it…to sort of bridge the gap between companies in need of new technologies and the startups building those new technologies.” Today, the partners recognize an interesting phenomenon taking place — senior execs of what they describe as “gen one” fintech startups. And, despite the recent volatility the fintech space has seen in the past couple of years (funding was down significantly in 2022 compared to the heyday of 2021), Vesey is naturally “long-term bullish” on fintech. “You only need to look at the past quarter of volatility and upheaval in the financial services industry to really reference that there are many, many problems that still need to be solved,” Huang told TechCrunch. “Having said that, things are cyclical…it’s like when the tide goes out, you see who’s sort of naked right? And for us, that is the infrastructure layer…that we always help our companies build and reinforce so that they can become trusted financial institutions for the long term. That has become a really important pillar, and now it’s back in vogue.” Huang also acknowledges that in 2021, the trio stepped back from investing “because it was getting way too frothy.” “Every company was sort of a ‘me too company,’ she recalls. “So we decided to take a step back and think about our value proposition and what has legs and what doesn’t.” Vesey intentionally chose to be on the ground in Israel (Eli-Lorch is based there), a market the partners view as being home to one of the world’s fastest growing tech hubs, with many companies focused on fintech, enterprise software, cybersecurity and data. It aims to help startups there partner, expand and commercialize in the U.S. The new firm is staying mum about its LPs, saying only they include seven “very prominent financial institutions,” as well as founders and executives from financial incumbents, family offices and institutional investors.  Reporter’s note: This story originally reported that Vesey Ventures’s debut fund represented a more than doubling of all money raised by women-led firms so far this year – but this is no longer accurate. On April 18, Define Ventures announced it had raised $460 million across two funds. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here. Got a news tip or inside information about a topic we covered?

397,What’s Turo worth?,['@alex'],"March 27, 2023","Late last week, Turo, a startup that allows consumers to rent their cars to one another, updated its IPO filing to include full-year data from 2022, giving us a better understanding of its post-COVID performance. Turo, a venture-backed company that has raised hundreds of millions while private, filed privately to go public back in 2021. That initial document was converted into a public filing the next year, with Turo updating its S-1 documentation regularly since — most recently to include Q4 2022 data. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. While TechCrunch and other publications have discussed unicorns like Instacart and Reddit as potential companies first out the IPO gate when the public-offering window reopens, perhaps we were looking in the wrong places. Turo could be the first. A Turo IPO would not be a small affair. PitchBook pegs the company’s most recent private-market price at $1.28 billion, making it a unicorn long in the making, having raised capital as early as 2009. Readers may recall that Turo was once called RelayRides and has over time extended its model to support users offering more than one car for its platform. Let’s sit down and look at Turo’s numbers in detail and dig up what we can from the recent rocky SPAC combination of Getaround, which has a similar model and may provide valuation clues for Turo. To work! "
398,Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy,['@etherington'],"April 4, 2023","Virgin Orbit, the low Earth orbit small-payload launch company that was spun out of Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, has filed for bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bankruptcy filing follows weeks of bad news for the company, including a pause on all operations, a brief hunt for more money to continue as a going concern and massive layoffs to try to right-size to the company’s actual available budget, which today’s news essentially confirms was nonexistent. Prior to this fast and furious couple-week meltdown, Virgin Orbit had already shown signs that it was essentially on life support: The company’s marquee first flight from a brand new British spaceport in January ended in failure due to an anomaly, and there was very little indication on when another attempt might arrive. Virgin Orbit spun out of Virgin Galactic way back in 2017, as the Branson-backed space company divided its efforts into two separate avenues of focus: Galactic would pursue human spaceflight, targeting suborbital trips for scientists and wealth thrill-seekers. That has borne some fruit, but also hasn’t yet achieved the scale and cadence of operation that it aspired to have accomplished at this stage. Orbit, meanwhile, was aimed at delivering small payloads to low Earth orbit using small rockets that launched from the wings of a large carrier ship, a modified 747-400 commercial passenger aircraft. The benefit of this approach was meant to be flexibility, since it theoretically meant launches could take place from any existing airfield capable of hosting a 747 with some adaptation. It was also supposed to usher in lower launch costs for customers who only needed to send up very light spacecraft. Virgin Orbit will seek a sale of the entire company or its assets as possible recourses to resolve its bankruptcy status, the company said in the filing."
399,How a fintech company handled a fintech crisis,['@christinemhall'],"April 3, 2023","When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed earlier this month, it sent massive waves across the banking and venture capital worlds, and beyond. Companies like Rippling, Brex and many others scrambled to secure funding to offset not being able to access funds, while companies on the payments side, like Etsy, worked to find alternative ways to process payments. Spend management company Airbase found itself straddling both of those worlds during the SVB crisis. TechCrunch+ spoke with CEO Thejo Kote about how Airbase not only had its funds with SVB but also was “the only spend management company that uses SVB as the payment rails for large parts of our platform.” Airbase CEO Thejo Kote. Image Credits: Airbase Airbase CEO Thejo Kote. Image Credits: Airbase When all of this went down initially, much of the attention was focused on the depositors who held funds, Airbase included; SVB was its primary operating bank, Kote said. SVB went into receivership on March 10, but there wasn’t the first sigh of relief until March 12 when the U.S. government stepped in and said deposits would be protected. “It was kind of a rollercoaster ride until that news [about the protected deposits] came out,” Kote said. “We had a unique front-row seat to this episode as a company that has its payment rails in SVB.” Airbase currently processes over $5 billion of annual payments on behalf of its customers, with a large portion flowing through SVB from customer bank accounts. On that particular day of the collapse, a “fairly large portion” of Airbase’s customers “had payments in flight,” Kote said. That meant that not only were they drawing funds for payroll but also to pay vendors, including many time-sensitive payments. The funds in transit totaled eight figures, and much of that was ultimately delayed by a few days, he said."
400,"African payment service provider Nomba raises $30M, backed by Base10 Partners and Shopify",['@ulonnaya'],"May 2, 2023","Nigerian payment service provider Nomba has raised $30 million in a pre-Series B investment to support the delivery of bespoke payment solutions for African businesses. The round, which values the company at $150 million+ according to YCombinator data on its most valuable companies, was led by San Francisco-based Base 10 Partners.  Partech and Khosla Ventures, existing investors from its $5 million Series A round in 2019, participated, as well as new backers, including Helios Digital Ventures and Shopify, which might be making its first investment on the continent through the Nigerian fintech outfit. Last May, the YC-backed Nomba, founded by Adeyinka Adewale and Pelumi Aboluwarin, underwent a rebrand from Kudi, which launched as a chatbot integration that responds to financial requests on social apps back in 2016. It was an online solution that has since been adopted in bits by various fintechs but struggled to attain massive scale in an African country where 90% of transactions in the informal economy are cash-based and over 60 million Nigerian adults are unbanked despite the proliferation of digital financial products.  Cash remains king, and Nomba pivoted its business two years after going live with its chatbot to fit that narrative. By operating an agency banking model, it supplied thousands of individuals and small business owners (who acted as its agents) with POS terminals to offer essential financial services such as cash withdrawal, transfer and bill payments to unbanked and underbanked Nigerians. The fintech is much more than that now. Its name change reflects that: Kudi, the simple cash-in, cash-out and payment and collection POS system, to Nomba, an omnichannel platform with a range of business and management tools for different types of businesses, which are also attractive to other fintechs offering interchangeable services such as Moniepoint, OPay and FairMoney, via its acquisition of CrowdForce.   “Our core focus has been figuring out how to help small businesses essentially scale. A lot of that is hinged on what kind of software tools we provide which could potentially reduce their cost of operation and provide better visibility to their business,” CEO Adewale told TechCrunch in an interview while mentioning that Shopify’s involvement in the round was to tap into the wealth of experience the global e-commerce giant has in providing small businesses with tools to scale their operations.  Nomba serves three business segments, categorized by their turnover, which relatively determines the type of payment solutions and software tools they access. First are agents and unit merchants that run retail businesses, usually under $100,000 in yearly transaction revenues. They are typically provided a POS terminal with immediate cash withdrawal and pay-bills features, including a Nomba account and dashboard to monitor these transactions. Another segment is medium-sized businesses with roughly $100,000 to a million dollars in yearly transaction revenues. They get access to Nomba’s POS terminals and software tools to reconcile payments and track collections across various business outlets. Lastly are enterprise customers (usually multistore businesses) whose transaction revenues are over $1 million and have access to POS capabilities and software tools for invoicing, order and inventory management and APIs for reconciliation and payment processing embedded into their existing systems or workflows.  A Nomba merchant dashboard. Image Credits: Nomba A Nomba merchant dashboard. Image Credits: Nomba Over 300,000 businesses from the three segments use at least one Nomba-powered product, and according to the fintech, it processes $1 billion in monthly transactions. The fintech has also seen its revenues grow 150% year-over-year since 2020, Adewale disclosed on the call. The company said the new investment will allow it to deliver tailored payment and operational solutions designed for specific businesses, including food companies and restaurants, as well as logistics and transport companies, to plug gaps in their payment processes. Powered by a yet-to-be-launched POS device called Nomba MAX, Nomba plans to enable restaurants to access menus, manage inventory, receive payments and perform other functions from the same hardware. And for transport and logistics companies, it will enable them to connect their transactions to payments directly. “We know that medium to large enterprise merchants have payment problems which are usually infrastructure based. So while our solutions help them improve success rates on transactions, we don’t think being a payment provider is good enough,” said Adewale on Nomba’s approach to launching the Nomba MAX which has akin features with vertical software such as Orda and Vendease, another Partech-backed upstart, in the restaurant management space. “The way we see it is that we need to build software that essentially makes us very valuable to these businesses by reducing order time and streamlining orders in one place. And we want to understand their business from the front end to the back office.” Product expansion aside, the chief executive also noted that Nomba, in a bid to replicate its success in Nigeria, would explore pan-African expansion. “We’re looking at a couple of markets, but it’s too early to share anything. It’s something that we’re spending a lot of time on.”  Luci Fonseca, partner at Base10, speaking on the investment, said, “Nomba’s track record of innovation and capital efficiency makes it one of the most exciting startups in Africa. We are thrilled to be supporting them to deliver their game-changing solutions to power growth and continued success for businesses in Nigeria and beyond.” The venture capital firm, which says it invests in the automation of the real economy, has backed Nigerian API fintech Okra and retail automation upstart Bumpa.

401,TikTok CEO testifies before Congress,['@tayhatmaker'],"March 23, 2023","As the Biden administration escalates its threats against TikTok, the company’s chief executive made his first appearance before Congress on Thursday. Given the U.S. government’s aggressive recent posture, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was destined for a harsh turn under the glare of the government’s big, bright lights — and that’s very much what played out across the hearing’s sprawling five hours. In opening statements, Chew offered reassurances that the company would safeguard the safety of minors, bolster its privacy and security practices and ward off any possibility of “unauthorized foreign access” to U.S. user data. “… I understand that there are concerns stemming from the inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government,” Chew said. “This is emphatically untrue.” Chew asserted that TikTok has never shared data on U.S. users with the Chinese government nor has it ever received a request to do so. If China did request access to data on Americans, Chew argued that the company would not comply. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said. As the hearing unfolded, lawmakers from both political parties pressed Chew for answers about the company’s relationship with China, its failure to moderate disturbing content and its plans to build trust in the U.S., its biggest market. Facing an onslaught of critical questions, TikTok tore a page out of the classic tech hearing playbook drafted by companies like Meta and Google in recent years. While Chew came off as comfortable and friendly — more than some U.S. tech executives can say — he overstated some of the company’s achievements and side-stepped substantive answers on tough issues time and time again. A number of representatives focused on TikTok’s impact on young users. After Chew touted the app’s 60-minute watch limit for teens, Rep. John Sarbanes brought the company’s claims about its protections against social media addiction back to reality. “My understanding is that teens can pretty easily bypass the notification to continue using the app if they want to,” Sarbanes said. “I mean, let’s face it, our teens are smarter than we are by half and they know how to use technology and they can get around these limits if they want to.” Early in his testimony, Chew cited a report from internet watchdog Citizen Lab, claiming that the organization definitively found no connection between the Chinese government and TikTok data. Citizen Lab’s director responded in real time on Twitter, criticizing the characterization. “Our analysis was explicit about having no visibility into what happened to user data once it was collected and transmitted back to TikTok’s servers,” he wrote. “Although we had no way to determine whether or not it had happened, we even speculated about possible mechanisms through which the Chinese government might use unconventional techniques to obtain TikTok user data via pressure on ByteDance.” In another exchange with Florida Rep. Neal Dunn, Chew objected to using the term “spying” to describe an incident in which ByteDance employees surveilled U.S. citizens through TikTok in order to identify the source of leaked information. .@DrNealDunnFL2: ""Has ByteDance spied on American citizens?"" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew: ""I don't think that spying is the right way to describe it."" pic.twitter.com/23nvsd7bEG — CSPAN (@cspan) March 23, 2023  Prior to Thursday’s hearing, Chew took to the app to announce that TikTok now has more than 150 million users in the U.S., a sizable jump up from its last reported numbers. The milestone cuts both ways, underlining concerns about TikTok’s massive influence among Americans and serving as a threat that a U.S. ban would outrage users and creators alike. At least one group of creators is staging a protest of the proposed ban in Washington, D.C. this week, drawing attention to the negative impact it would have on their businesses.  Our CEO, Shou Chew, shares a special message on behalf of the entire TikTok team to thank our community of 150 million Americans ahead of his congressional hearing later this week. ♬ original sound – TikTok  “Americans deserve to know the extent to which their privacy is jeopardized and their data is manipulated by ByteDance-owned TikTok’s relationship with China,” Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers said. “What’s worse, we know Big Tech companies, like TikTok, use harmful algorithms to exploit children for profit and expose them to dangerous content online.” The committee pressed Chew over measures that TikTok is taking to protect kids on the app, noting that the hearing is the latest effort to make tech companies accountable for their negative impacts on society. Lawmakers also emphasized worries TikTok parent company ByteDance is based in China with Chinese ownership that it could be leveraged by the Chinese government to further state interests. While there’s no evidence that China is harvesting data on Americans or intentionally shaping political behavior through its algorithms, there is reason to be concerned that the company’s privacy practices aren’t airtight. Last year an internal investigation at the company confirmed reporting that employees at its Beijing headquarters intended to track U.S. journalists via their TikTok activity in an effort to uncover the source of internal leaks. That incident apparently prompted probes from multiple federal agencies, which were first reported last week. The Fraud Section of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division is working with the FBI and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to investigate the breach of user privacy, putting additional pressure on the company’s imperiled U.S. business. TikTok has long pushed back over privacy concerns, arguing that TikTok’s American operations are walled off from its Beijing-based leadership — and from China itself. Earlier this month, reports surfaced that the U.S. government is currently seeking to force ByteDance to sell TikTok, threatening a national ban on the app if the company doesn’t comply. TikTok responded by pointing to its recent campaign to self-regulate, an undertaking known as Project Texas. The campaign is part of an ongoing TikTok charm offensive in the U.S. that seeks to portray the company’s U.S. operations as transparent and comes with about $1.5 billion in infrastructure spending and corporate re-organization. The idea is that TikTok itself can erect a firewall between the company’s American business and its Chinese ownership, potentially placating the U.S. government in the process. The U.S. doesn’t look likely to back down, but it’s far from clear it’s in a position to follow through on recent threats. The White House attempted a similar maneuver during the Trump White House, but its efforts fell apart before being picked back up by the Biden administration in an unusual show of policy continuity between the two. Former President Trump’s threats against TikTok eventually culminated in a plan to force ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations to Oracle in late 2020. At the time, TikTok also rejected an acquisition offer from Microsoft, but in time the deal with Oracle fizzled too. Oracle never bought the company, but it’s still in the picture. TikTok later partnered with Oracle to shift U.S. data onto U.S.-based servers with the company and to run audits of its algorithms and content moderation systems — an odd move and an odd partner to do it with, given Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison’s participation in the campaign to undermine the legitimate results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Given the stakes for the company and its users — and politicians’ penchant for rousing anti-China sentiment — Thursday’s TikTok was explosive in form even when it wasn’t in function. Between lawmakers frequently opting to grandstand instead of allowing their sole witness to speak and others that failed to understand the basic features of the app in question, Thursday’s hearing offered more bark than bite.

402,Ursa Major to provide engines for the upper stage of Astra’s new rocket,['@breadfrom'],"April 24, 2023","Astra’s new Rocket 4 launch vehicle will use Ursa Major’s Hadley liquid engine to power its upper stage, the two companies announced Monday. Astra has been tight-lipped about the new upper-stage engine that would power its new Rocket 4, with CEO Chris Kemp only telling investors last year that the rocket’s substantially increased payload capacity was thanks in part to engine upgrades. Outsourcing the engine helps clarify how Astra was able to so quickly pivot its plans for Rocket 4, including doubling the launch vehicle’s payload capacity from 300 kilograms to 600 kilograms. Rocket 4 marks a major deviation for Astra, which has historically focused on extremely lightweight, high-cadence rockets. After a series of launch failures and in response to customer input, the company said it would go in a decidedly different direction. When Astra announced the change last August, Kemp said the company was especially keen to target mega constellation operators with its higher capacity system. Astra plans on conducting initial test launches later this year. Whether the company resumes commercial launch operations this year will depend on how those tests go, Kemp said. Astra is the latest launcher company to use Ursa’s engines. Ursa also counts Phantom Space and Stratolaunch amongst its customers. The Colorado-based engine maker also recently closed a deal with the U.S. Air Force, bringing their total number of engines currently under contract across defense and commercial customers to around 30. In addition to Hadley, Ursa is developing a substantially more powerful Ripley engine, which will be able to generate about 10 times more thrust. The news confirmed a long-held rumor amongst space aficionados that the two companies had inked a deal. Rumors started swirling when Astra released its first payload users guide for Rocket 4 last November, and space sleuths noticed that the upper stage’s engine was listed as being turbopump-fed and capable of generating approximately 6,500 pounds of thrust. People speculated that it could only be a Hadley variant, given the time and financial constraints facing Astra. Turns out they were right. The story has been updated to reflect that Ursa Major has orders for around 30 engines across both defense and commercial customers, not just defense customers. "
403,"Spend management space sees a large raise, and layoffs, in the same week","['Mary Ann Azevedo', 'Christine Hall']","April 30, 2023","Welcome to The Interchange! If you received this in your inbox, thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you’re reading this as a post on our site, sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week, we’ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s our job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know.  About a year ago, it seemed like myself and other colleagues were writing story after story about spend management companies raising tranches of venture capital — remember Mary Ann’s roundup story from basically this same time last year? On Friday, PitchBook’s Q1 2023 B2B fintech investment report showed that investment into enterprise fintech was $11.8 billion. Though it is a decrease from the same quarter in 2022, it was above the first quarter of 2021. And compared to the shrinking of quarter-to-quarter investments for the rest of 2022, the $11.8 billion shows a boost of confidence from investors, and dare we say a comeback? Those figures are certainly proving themselves in stories we’ve been working on lately that show some spend management companies continue to do well in raising money and generating revenue. One of those is Clara, a spend management company based in Mexico that announced $60 million in new funding last week. Gerry Giacomán Colyer, Clara’s co-founder and CEO, told me the company is working with over 10,000 customers across Latin America and that its annual run rate of 5 million credit card transactions is equivalent to $1 billion. He also noted that “over 10x in transactional volume is coming from revenue. With Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, we are covering two-thirds of LatAm’s GDP.” Giacomán Colyer also expects continued 2x month over month growth through the end of the year. Meanwhile, last month, Mary Ann wrote about Ramp’s 4x revenue growth in 2022. She spoke to co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman, who described the successful results “as a desire on the part of companies of all sizes and stages seeking to save money by managing their spend better.” However, despite the seemingly good times the spend management sector is currently experiencing, we learned this week that not everyone is popping bottles. Axios reported last week that Teampay, a corporate card company, confirmed it laid off 30% of its 100-person staff “in two instances in recent months.” This comes five months after colleague Kyle Wiggers reported that Teampay secured $47 million in equity and debt. Perhaps founder and CEO Andrew Hoag inadvertently forecasted the layoffs when he told Kyle, “Teampay’s software-led approach has proven resilient — as we saw in late 2020 to 2021, when the economy rebounds, Teampay benefits disproportionately through accelerated growth.” If that’s true, maybe the opposite is also true: When the economy doesn’t do so well, maybe Teampay doesn’t do so well either? Despite Teampay’s setback, the numbers are showing it’s still a space to watch. We’ll keep an eye on it for you. Now I’m throwing it over to Mary Ann, who got the scoop on Navan’s growth metrics. — Christine Clara’s co-founders Diego Iván García Escobedo and Gerry Giacomán Colyer Image Credits: Clara Clara’s co-founders Diego Iván García Escobedo and Gerry Giacomán Colyer Image Credits: Clara A few weeks ago I talked to Ariel Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Navan (formerly TripActions), about that company’s growth. For the unacquainted, Navan was initially focused on travel expense management before accelerating efforts on its general spend management offering in 2020 after its revenue literally dropped to zero when the pandemic hit. Highlights of the conversation include Ariel sharing some impressive growth metrics: Spend volume processed via Navan Expense in the first quarter of 2023 grew more than 3x compared to Q1 2022 — and by 4.7x when looking at the 12 consecutive months ending in March 2023, as compared to the 12 months preceding. Also, the company touts that recent calendar year volume is nearly 80x that of the first full year of the Navan Expense product launch. Revenue-wise, Navan says it saw “3x YoY revenue growth.” I also asked Ariel if Navan was still planning to go public considering it filed confidentially to do so in September of last year. His answer: “I think eventually we will be a public company. We’ve raised around $1.4 billion to date and maturity wise, we are there, to be public. Growthwise, we are growing extremely fast, and a lot of our metrics would support being public. I don’t think the market is there right now.” I also got a demo from CTO and co-founder Ilan Twig of just how Navan is using ChatGPT within its new offering, which is essentially a CFO dashboard, the company says. It was very interesting to see firsthand how its chatbot, Ava, works. Ilan was almost like a child with a new toy, honestly, giddily showing me how the bot could provide insight as to which hotels employees had used the most within a given time period in a given city, and other details such as did they get a corporate negotiated rate, or not? It even produced graphs! At one point, Ilan did have to reword his prompt but it was cool to see how the chatbot could respond to questions sequentially based on previous prompts. Navan’s goal is to help replace data analysts at companies, it says, ultimately helping them save money in more ways than one. A recent panel at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas in March — made up of Mesh Payments co-founder and CEO Oded Zehavi; Michael Sindicich, EVP and general manager of Navan Expense; and Michael Tannenbaum, COO and CFO at Brex — also touched on the topic of innovation in the space — all agreeing on the importance of globalization, automation and travel expense as a category. This quote from Zehavi of Mesh Payments (which raised its own $60 million funding round last September) sums up pretty well the potential for spend management companies: “We were all playing a game of musical chairs. When it was very happy music, many companies in our space got a lot of funding, even though their fundamentals were not so strong. And now the music has stopped, some of us have chairs, but others don’t…The fact that we are connected to the accounting system, we see all the employees, we sit in the middle between the employees, the finance team, and the vendors, is an amazing position for us to leverage and start offering more and more services under the stack of the CFO that we’ll be able to monetize.” — Mary Ann Last week, I published a scoop on fintech-focused VC firm Anthemis having laid off 28% of its staff, or 16 people, earlier this year as part of a restructuring. While 16 people may not seem like a lot, when it comes to venture firms, it actually is. It’s not typical, or often, that we see such large cuts at one time. Anthemis is an active investor, having backed the likes of eToro and Betterment. It’s also had a couple of recent stumbles in Pipe and Daylight. So the news of its staff reduction came as a bit of a surprise. (These are among the least fun types of scoops.) One thing that struck me is that after publishing the story, a founder reached out expressing concern about perception around Farhan Lalji — a former managing director at Anthemis — being among those affected by the cuts. That founder wrote me a note saying that while at Anthemis, “Farhan was the first VC to believe in” his company. “And there’s no way we’d be where we are today without him,” he added. Anyway, I have since learned that Farhan has branched out to start his own firm, LTV Capital. Interestingly, there was a lot of chatter on Twitter as to whether these layoffs were an outlier in the industry or “a sign of what’s to come.” It’s hard to say. There could be other similar cuts taking place at other venture firms, and we just don’t know about them. But as Alex pointed out in last week’s episode of the Equity podcast, if firms are investing less, wouldn’t it make sense that they would need less staff? Meanwhile, a couple of days after my story ran, Anthemis announced that it secured additional capital from institutions such as Visa and BMO for its Female Innovators Lab (FIL) Fund. In a statement, the firm said: “Anchored by Barclays, with investment from Aviva, the fund now totals $50 million, making it the largest early-stage fintech fund focused on female founders. With this latest raise, the fund will invest in additional early-stage companies and continue its focus on designing, sourcing, and scaling female-founded embedded finance startups.” — Mary Ann Having covered fintech now for a few years, it’s less and less often that I come across companies building technology that feels, well, unique. But this week, I wrote about a startup building something I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before: virtual wallets for merchants. It sounds simple, right? But it’s not, or else we’d see a lot more of it outside the Starbucks of the world. Interesting backstory: Sophia Goldberg, a former Adyen product manager, had this idea for a company but was looking for a technical co-founder. Bain Capital Ventures partner Christina Melas-Kyriazi ended up introducing Sophia to JT Cho, a software engineer she’d worked with at Affirm. The two self-proclaimed “payments nerds” hit it off famously and went on to raise $5.4 million for Ansa. Besides Bain, other backers include Nimi Katragadda at Box Group; Nichole Wischoff at Wischoff Ventures; Cambrian Ventures; the Fintech Fund; Susa Ventures; and angels such as Plaid co-founder and CEO Zach Perret; Gokul Rajaram and the founders of Alloy; among others. I tend to always root for the underdog, so the fact that Ansa aims to help small businesses like coffee shops and quick-service restaurants (and down the line, they say, enterprises) save money on fees and better retain customers made me happy. Read more here. — Mary Ann Image Credits: Ansa Image Credits: Ansa A super interesting feature from Catherine Shu: “Southeast Asia is already home to a thriving fintech scene, where Grab, GoTo and Sea have built super apps that encompass financial services, and startups like Xendit, Akulaku and Dana (to name a few) have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for payments, banking services and other financial tools. Indonesia and Malaysia, in the heart of Southeast Asia, are among the countries with the largest Muslim populations in the world. These factors are proving fertile ground for establishing and growing fintechs that focus exclusively on Islamic finance, offering products and services that follow shariah law.” More here. Mary Ann wrote about how Shopify has teamed up with Israeli B2B payments startup Melio to launch a new bill pay tool designed to allow U.S.-based merchant customers to manage their expenses and vendors via its platform. It’s another step in Shopify’s plan to straddle the intersection of fintech and commerce, noted Shruti Patel, global head of merchant services partnerships and monetization at Shopify. The rationale behind the new feature plays to the notion that if merchants can spend less time on tedious tasks such as consolidating their invoices and paying bills, they can spend more time focusing on growing their businesses. It also was in part driven by merchants asking for money movement capabilities, Patel told TechCrunch in an interview. More here. Smart analysis from Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm: “While the banking world watches American lender First Republic publicly convulse after its earnings report detailed a widespread evaporation of its deposit base, the startup world of neobanks is taking blows as well. Earlier this week, Revolut, a highly valued, U.K.-based neobank saw its valuation decline by some 46% in the eyes of one of its backers…Revolut’s revaluation raises a few questions: How much trimming is there left to do in the fintech world? And, are we likely to see something similar more generally in the neobanking startup sector?” More here. Speaking of banks, Alex first took a look at First Republic’s tanking stock and deposits earlier in the week: “Shares of First Republic Bank are off 29% in early-morning trading Tuesday as investors digest its first-quarter earnings results, which came out Monday after the bell. The bank reported revenue and profit above analysts’ expectations, but for investors, other concerns outweighed the good results. Chief among those concerns is a massive decline in the bank’s deposit base. The bank closed 2022 with $176.4 billion worth of deposits against $166.9 billion in loans, but by the end of Q1 2023, it had $104.5 billion in deposits against $173.3 billion in loans.” More here. By Friday, unfortunately for First Republic, the stock had tanked even further at the threat of government intervention. And, listen to Mary Ann, Alex and Natasha riff on just how much the Silicon Valley Bank debacle played a role in all this on the Equity podcast. Contributor and fintech consultant Grant Easterbrook takes a look at three fintech concepts that, in his view, “initially seemed promising but largely failed to change the financial services industry.” You may agree. You may not. Either way, it’s a good read. More here. Reports Rebecca Bellan: “Uber Freight, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, is partnering with transportation fintech startup AtoB to offer carriers fuel cards and spend management software. AtoB, a four-year-old company that has been described as Stripe for transportation, offers an integrated financial platform based around its core product of a fuel card for truckers. Unlike other fuel cards offered by competitors like Brex and Fleetcor, AtoB’s fuel card is based on the Visa platform, so payments are more likely to be accepted at a wider range of fuel retailers. There are also no hidden or annual fees, according to the company.” More here. Christine spoke with Stripe’s Vivek Sharma, head of revenue and finance automation, about the financial infrastructure company’s updates to its revenue and finance automation suite that included new billing features, tax API and revenue reporting tool. “It’ll lead us into the larger trend that’s happening in what we call the ‘revenue front office and finance back office,’” Sharma said. “These are considered to be disconnected systems, so Stripe has had a rare privilege of sitting right in the middle.” TechCrunch reported earlier this month that Stripe processed $817 billion in transactions in 2022 and is now valued at $50 billion after raising $6.5 billion in March.

404,Tidal’s new Live feature will let you host a live DJing session,['@indianidle'],"April 4, 2023","Tidal is rolling out a new feature that lets you act as a DJ and allow your friends to listen to your choices. The feature called Live is available for both HiFi ($9.99 per month) and HiFi Plus ($19.99 per month) subscribers of the streaming service. This feature doesn’t exactly work like Spotify’s Group Sessions, which lets all participants control the song queue. Tidal’s Live feature puts one person in charge of the song selection (the initiator) — they handle the track listing. The Block-owned company has been testing it under the “DJ” moniker since last December, and now it is being rolled out to all users. Users can create a session while listening to any song or playlist by tapping the Live button in the top-right corner. They can name the session and share the link with their friends. Those friends can click on the link to start listening to music if they are paying subscribers. If not, Tidal will ask them to join via a free trial. Notably, whatever is in the session creator’s “now playing” queue becomes part of the session. But they can edit this list to make it more suitable to a session’s theme if needed. Tidal noted that the number of listeners in a session accounts for the number of streams per song. So if five people are listening to a track, it counts as five streams. There’s a caveat though. You can only create and listen to a session in your registered country. So you can’t have a listening party with your cross-border friends. Image Credits: Tidal Image Credits: Tidal Tidal says that you will see different live sessions on the home page, including the ones by the company’s curators and your friends. The company said it is “learning and experimenting” with the section to make it more relevant to a user. “With Live we wanted to do a couple of things. We thought music is something that should be easily shared. We wanted to create something for your family’s designated DJ or a friend who is a tastemaker, who can easily showcase their taste. Think of this as a tech-enabled version of connecting the aux cable at the party,” Agustina Sacerdote, global head of Product at Tidal, told TechCrunch over a call. (While the aux analogy is great, not sure people still relate to it given our phones don’t have headphone jacks anymore). In terms of social features, users can only see how many people are tuned into a session. But there are no features like reactions or comments. Sacerdote said that the streaming service is “envisioning” features like giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down reactions to the DJ’s choices. Image Credits: Tidal Image Credits: Tidal Apart from releasing the feature, Tidal said that it is concentrating on supporting rising artists. The company is thinking of these artists as small businesses and wants to help them manage this stuff. It is leaning on Block’s expertise in helping small businesses and wants to build on that for artists. Though Tidal didn’t specify what tools it is making. “We were very committed to this notion of helping artists better manage and grow their business, which is effectively their fans. So you can imagine a world in which Live becomes a tool with which artists manage and connect with their audiences,” Sacerdote said. When TechCrunch asked if these tools would include things like merchandising, tickets or NFTs, Tidal said “all those things are not out of question,” but didn’t elaborate if it plans to release any of them. In February, Spotify started testing NFT-gated playlists with select artists and crypto projects. Last month, Tidal shut down its direct artist payout program in favor of an emerging artist project called Tidal Rising. The company has committed $5 million to this program, and the money will be used in hosting workshops and helping artists with studio recordings and promotional materials."
405,Aventurine wants to help would-be entrepreneurs with its IP-first investment thesis,['@Haje'],"April 23, 2023","“There’s a ton of stuff that really could be impacting the lives of everybody on Earth, that is not making it out of the lab and into practical application,” said David Van Wie, founder and chief investment officer at Aventurine Capital Group. That’s how he summarizes the problem he is trying to solve with his IP-forward accelerator. He hopes that spinning out companies — and letting inventors and academics continue to do what they do best — is a winning formula. Aventurine focuses on where venture capital doesn’t typically go: It gets in early to support people who aren’t natural entrepreneurs and invests in IP for the long term using what it calls a Perpetual IP Income fund, or PIPI fund. If it sounds as if it’s the antithesis of quick growth and timely exit, that’d be accurate. But the team believes that’s OK, and that perhaps VCs don’t need to be in a big fat hurry all the time anyway.   “This is a researcher who spent 20 years of their lives chasing a certain thing,” said Joe Maruschak, the company’s managing director of Aventurine’s investment studio. That’s how he described who Aventurine is looking to fund. “They caught the bug for chemistry, and they’ve spent all of their lives going into chemistry. They’ve got their Ph.D., got a job in university, and then discovered something.” Central to Aventurine’s thesis is that academics shouldn’t have to be entrepreneurs to ensure that their discoveries or innovations can be developed and brought to market to eventually have an impact in the world. It recognizes that a researcher’s skill set is not necessarily the same as a founder’s, and that they shouldn’t be forced to learn how to do it overnight. "
406,Read’s AI-powered summary feature squeezes a meeting into a two-minute clip,['@indianidle'],"March 31, 2023","Summarization is one of the common use cases of different AI models, and we now have multiple tools that shrink articles, PDFs, videos and transcripts into easily digestible pieces of information. Now, meeting intelligence tool Read has introduced a new feature that trims an hour-long meeting into a two-minute clip, accompanied by important pointers. The company says it is using large language models — it didn’t specify which one — combined with video analysis to pick out the most notable parts of the meeting. Read also incorporates participants’ reactions in a highlight reel. Users can go to their recording of a meeting and turn off the “Play highlights only” toggle to see the condensed clip. Image Credits: Read.ai Image Credits: Read.ai Read was co-founded in 2021 by former Foursquare CEO David Shim. The tool, which works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Webex, gives you analytics like sentiment as well as participant engagement scores to measure the effectiveness of a meeting. The company has raised $10 million in seed funding from investors including Madrona Venture Group and PSL Ventures. Shim compared watching the two-minute reel to watching the highlights of a sports game. He also said that during the test period, the company found that some clients had an impactful increase in productivity. “During a preview period, agency clients experienced a 30%+ increase in productivity for employees. Tedious tasks including pulling together notes were completed automatically, and the sharing of these notes along with manually generated video highlights eliminated the need to set up a meeting to talk about the last meeting,” he said in a statement. Image Credits: Read Image Credits: Read In January, Read introduced a text-based summary feature that was powered by OpenAI’s GPT model. The video highlight feature is an evolution of that. The demo below shows that, at times, the highlights cut off the speaker mid-sentence, which can be annoying when trying to listen to important points. The company said it is working on improving this aspect. https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Read_Highlight_Demo_TC.mp4 Read also noted that it will incorporate text summaries in the videos using captions in the coming weeks. Tons of companies — including Otter and Zoom — are working on providing AI-aided summaries of meetings. While most of them use some kind of large language model, Read’s approach to having a TikTok-style short video summary can appeal to people looking to skim through multiple missed meetings."
407,Sequoia-backed Zamp Finance makes it easier for businesses to invest in US Treasury Bills,['@refsrc'],"April 3, 2023","Amit Jain, the former head of Uber’s Asia Pacific division, revealed his new venture, Zamp Finance, that aims to simplify the process for businesses to invest their excess capital in US Treasury bills to hedge against bank failures and other uncertainties. Zamp offers a treasury management platform that enables businesses worldwide to invest surplus cash in U.S. Treasury bills and notes, partnering with BNY Mellon Pershing, which manages over $2 trillion. The platform serves businesses of all sizes, it said. The U.S. Treasury Bills are regarded as a safe investment, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, has high liquidity, predictable yield and tax benefits. “Our customers, and a lot of them are startups, are not looking for a particular yield or want to speculate with the cash they have. They are looking for ways to keep their cash safe in a way that protects them from risks related to currency or institution,” said Jain in an interview. He also disclosed that the U.S.-registered startup raised a seed round of $21.7 million last year, publicly commenting on the fundraise for the first time. The round was led by Sequoia India and Southeast Asia, with participation from a number of high-profile executives, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, former SoftBank chief operating officer Marcelo Claure, and Doordash chief executive Tony Xu. TechCrunch reported about the investment talks in May. Jain left Sequoia India and Southeast Asia, where he served as a partner, last year. Jain. Image Credits: Sequoia India Jain. Image Credits: Sequoia India Zamp has multiple appeals: It eases a firm’s access to financial instruments and serves as a corporate treasurer, allowing businesses to focus on their core operations. Zamp’s customers get brokerage accounts with BNY Mellon, meaning that their funds remain segregated from those of other customers. Zamp declined to reveal how many customers it has, but noted that more than a 100 businesses signed up in two weeks following the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank. “If all your money is in a bank, then you’re subject to the risks of the bank. It’s not something that people thought much about earlier, but obviously has been in the news for the last few weeks. Now an increasingly growing number of founders are thinking about diversification of cash into multiple bank accounts,” Jain said. Zamp plans to add more financial instruments over time. Jain said the startup has evaluated several sovereign funds and corporate bonds, but he asserted that whether Zamp offers them to customers depends on their feedback and demand."
408,Elon Musk may have accidentally leaked his burner account,['@asilbwrites'],"April 25, 2023","Elon Musk tweeted a photo on Monday night that shows him logged into his Twitter account, advertising to content creators how they can activate monetization features on Twitter. Unfortunately for Musk, people weren’t paying much attention to the fact that he has 24.7K paid subscribers — instead, some users realized that he appeared to be logged into another account. And upon deeper investigation, it looked like the account belonged to @ErmnMusk, a now-deleted account with the display name “Elon Test,” which used a photo of Musk’s three-year-old son as its avatar. Is this really Elon Musk’s burner account? We’re hesitant to make that definitive claim (and if we tried to ask for comment from Twitter or Musk himself, we would simply receive a poop emoji in response). But there is evidence that makes this theory seem more plausible than not. Content creators may wish to enable subscriptions on this platform. Just tap on Monetization in settings. pic.twitter.com/CmD06Mczmn — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 24, 2023  Many of the tweets on this possible burner account were quite mundane, including tweets about having no followers (last we saw before the account was deleted, it had since been followed by over 27,000 people. Whoops!). But some posts get a bit uncomfortable. When Bitcoin promoter Michael Saylor tweeted about Satoshi — the pseudonymous figure who developed Bitcoin — @ErmnMusk replied, “Do you like Japanese girls?” In another tweet, @ErmnMusk replied to a post making fun of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who dated FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. She pled guilty to billions of dollars in wire fraud amid the FTX collapse, prompting one user to make fun of Ellison’s appearance while crudely implying that Bankman-Fried risked his billionaire status for sex. @ErmnMusk replied, “I 💜 librarians.” In some other tweets, it seemed like @ErmnMusk was pretending to be X, Musk’s two-year-old son X Æ A-XII, who he calls X. During the FTX collapse, Airbnb founder Brian Chesky tweeted, “It feels like we were in a nightclub and the lights just turned on.” @ErmnMusk replied, “I wish I was old enough to go to nightclubs. They sound so fun.” In another tweet, @ErmnMusk posted, “I will finally turn 3 on May 4th!”, which is consistent with X’s actual birth date. Could Musk just be trolling everyone? Sure. But beyond the fact that these tweets very much echo Musk’s general online demeanor, there’s more evidence that this could be Musk’s burner account. The account was created soon after Musk purchased Twitter, and per VICE’s reporting, the image of X — uploaded on November 29, 2022 — doesn’t seem to have appeared anywhere else online before this (in a few short hours, it has since proliferated across Twitter, where many users are impersonating the now-deleted account). Programmer Travis Brown pulled 99 “profile snapshots” of the account, which show that it has used the name “Elon Test” for most of its existence, except for when it used the name “Star Sapphire.” The best evidence I’ve seen that @ErmnMusk was Elon’s alt is the age of the profile image: it was uploaded on 29 November 2022. Even if you don’t trust my data, you can tell by the Snowflake ID in the URL, which encodes the date. https://t.co/bCItLvr61S — Travis Brown (@travisbrown) April 25, 2023  So, how bad is it really that Musk possibly leaked his own burner account? Hey, we’ve all been there! Sometimes you just accidentally leak your burner account where you alternate between roleplaying as a toddler and making gross comments about women.    "
409,Google removes hundreds of Kenya-focused loan apps from Play Store,['@annienjanja'],"March 24, 2023","Google has taken down hundreds of loan apps from the Play Store in Kenya since its new policy, which requires digital lenders in the East African country to submit proof of license, went into effect in January. The policy came in the wake of Kenya’s Digital Credit Providers (DCP) regulations last year, which required entities that provide loans digitally to acquire a license to operate from the Central Bank of Kenya. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear how many loan apps had been blacklisted, but a spot check by TechCrunch today showed that nearly 500 apps previously in the Finance category on Play Store, including MoKash and Okash, had been taken down. In early February, TechCrunch counted 657 apps in the Finance category, which lists loans, banking and investing apps amongst others. Today, only 198 apps are listed in the category.   By January, only 22 digital lenders had received a license out of the 381 that applied, according to the Central Bank of Kenya. These included Tala, a PayPal-backed loan provider; Pezesha, a B2B embedded lending platform; and Jumo, which provides financial services, including lending. Google requires loan apps awaiting a license to submit a declaration form attesting that approval is pending in order to obtain interim approval, which will be valid for 45 days, to be listed on the Play Store. Before the DCP regulations went into force, many of these credit apps used to offer quick, unsecured personal or business loans; charge exorbitant interest rates, apply debt-shaming tactics to recover their money, and share customer data with third parties, taking advantage of the lack of regulations and the Play Store’s slack vetting process. The regulations, meant to weed out rogue players, also require loan apps to observe consumer privacy and data protection rights as well as anti-money laundering laws. This is in addition to disclosing the terms and pricing of loans to customers before approval and disbursement.    "
410,The Great Pretender,['@techcrunch'],"April 3, 2023","There is a good reason not to trust what today’s AI constructs tell you, and it has nothing to do with the fundamental nature of intelligence or humanity, with Wittgensteinian concepts of language representation, or even disinfo in the dataset. All that matters is that these systems do not distinguish between something that is correct and something that looks correct. Once you understand that the AI considers these things more or less interchangeable, everything makes a lot more sense. Now, I don’t mean to short circuit any of the fascinating and wide-ranging discussions about this happening continually across every form of media and conversation. We have everyone from philosophers and linguists to engineers and hackers to bartenders and firefighters questioning and debating what “intelligence” and “language” truly are, and whether something like ChatGPT possesses them. This is amazing! And I’ve learned a lot already as some of the smartest people in this space enjoy their moment in the sun, while from the mouths of comparative babes come fresh new perspectives. But at the same time, it’s a lot to sort through over a beer or coffee when someone asks “what about all this GPT stuff, kind of scary how smart AI is getting, right?” Where do you start — with Aristotle, the mechanical Turk, the perceptron or “Attention is all you need”? During one of these chats I hit on a simple approach that I’ve found helps people get why these systems can be both really cool and also totally untrustable, while subtracting not at all from their usefulness in some domains and the amazing conversations being had around them. I thought I’d share it in case you find the perspective useful when talking about this with other curious, skeptical people who nevertheless don’t want to hear about vectors or matrices. There are only three things to understand, which lead to a natural conclusion: So given what we know about how the model works, here’s the crucial question: What is it confident about? It doesn’t know what a cat or a question is, only statistical relationships found between data nodes in a training set. A minor tweak would have the cat detector equally confident the picture showed a cow, or the sky, or a still life painting. The model can’t be confident in its own “knowledge” because it has no way of actually evaluating the content of the data it has been trained on. The AI is expressing how sure it is that its answer appears correct to the user. This is true of the cat detector, and it is true of GPT-4 — the difference is a matter of the length and complexity of the output. The AI cannot distinguish between a right and wrong answer — it only can make a prediction of how likely a series of words is to be accepted as correct. That is why it must be considered the world’s most comprehensively informed bullshitter rather than an authority on any subject. It doesn’t even know it’s bullshitting you — it has been trained to produce a response that statistically resembles a correct answer, and it will say anything to improve that resemblance. The AI doesn’t know the answer to any question, because it doesn’t understand the question. It doesn’t know what questions are. It doesn’t “know” anything! The answer follows the question because, extrapolating from its statistical analysis, that series of words is the most likely to follow the previous series of words. Whether those words refer to real places, people, locations, etc. is not material — only that they are like real ones. It’s the same reason AI can produce a Monet-like painting that isn’t a Monet — all that matters is it has all the characteristics that cause people to identify a piece of artwork as his. Today’s AI approximates factual responses the way it would approximate “Water Lilies.” Now, I hasten to add that this isn’t an original or groundbreaking concept — it’s basically another way to explain the stochastic parrot, or the undersea octopus. Those problems were identified very early by very smart people and represent a great reason to read commentary on tech matters widely.   But in the context of today’s chatbot systems, I’ve just found that people intuitively get this approach: The models don’t understand facts or concepts, but relationships between words, and its responses are an “artist’s impression” of an answer. Their goal, when you get down to it, is to fill in the blank convincingly, not correctly. This is the reason why its responses fundamentally cannot be trusted. Of course sometimes, even a lot of the time, its answer is correct! And that isn’t an accident: For many questions, the answer that looks the most correct is the correct answer. That is what makes these models so powerful — and dangerous. There is so, so much you can extract from a systematic study of millions of words and documents. And unlike recreating “Water Lilies” exactly, there’s a flexibility to language that lets an approximation of a factual response also be factual — but also make a totally or partially invented response appear equally or more so. The only thing the AI cares about is that the answer scans right. This leaves the door open to discussions around whether this is truly knowledge, what if anything the models “understand,” if they have achieved some form of intelligence, what intelligence even is and so on. Bring on the Wittgenstein! Furthermore, it also leaves open the possibility of using these tools in situations where truth isn’t really a concern. If you want to generate five variants of an opening paragraph to get around writer’s block, an AI might be indispensable. If you want to make up a story about two endangered animals, or write a sonnet about Pokémon, go for it. As long as it is not crucial that the response reflects reality, a large language model is a willing and able partner — and not coincidentally, that’s where people seem to be having the most fun with it. Where and when AI gets it wrong is very, very difficult to predict because the models are too large and opaque. Imagine a card catalog the size of a continent, organized and updated over a period of a hundred years by robots, from first principles that they came up with on the fly. You think you can just walk in and understand the system? It gives a right answer to a difficult question and a wrong answer to an easy one. Why? Right now that is one question that neither AI nor its creators can answer. This may well change in the future, perhaps even the near future. Everything is moving so quickly and unpredictably that nothing is certain. But for the present this is a useful mental model to keep in mind: The AI wants you to believe it and will say anything to improve its chances."

412,Russian hackers exploit six-year-old Cisco flaw to target US government agencies,['@carlypage_'],"April 19, 2023","APT28, a state-sponsored hacking group operated by Russian military intelligence, is exploiting a six-year-old vulnerability in Cisco routers to deploy malware and carry out surveillance, according to the U.S. and U.K. governments. In a joint advisory issued on Tuesday, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA along with the FBI, the NSA and the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Center detail how the Russia-backed hackers exploited Cisco router vulnerabilities throughout 2021 with the aim of targeting European organizations and U.S. government institutions. The advisory said the hackers also hacked “approximately 250 Ukrainian victims,” which the agencies did not name. APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, is known for carrying out a range of cyberattacks, espionage and hack-and-leak information operations on behalf of the Russian government. According to the joint advisory, the hackers exploited a remotely exploitable vulnerability patched by Cisco in 2017 to deploy a custom-built malware dubbed “Jaguar Tooth,” which is designed to infect unpatched routers. To install the malware, the threat actors scan for internet-facing Cisco routers using a default or easy-to-guess SNMP community string. SNMP, or Simple Network Management Protocol, allows network administrators to remotely access and configure routers in place of a username or password, but can also be misused to obtain sensitive network information. Once installed, the malware exfiltrates information from the router and provides stealthy backdoor access to the device, the agencies said. Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence at Cisco Talos, said in a blog post this campaign is an example of “a much broader trend of sophisticated adversaries targeting networking infrastructure to advance espionage objectives or pre-position for future destructive activity.” “Cisco is deeply concerned by an increase in the rate of high-sophistication attacks on network infrastructure — that we have observed and have seen corroborated by numerous reports issued by various intelligence organizations — indicating state-sponsored actors are targeting routers and firewalls globally,” Olney said. Olney added that in addition to Russia, China has also been spotted attacking network equipment in several campaigns. Earlier this year, Mandiant reported that Chinese state-backed attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Fortinet devices to carry out a series of attacks on government organizations.  "

Similar to how MetaMask has a connect button on its desktop client, this adapter is a “comprehensive technology” that will bridge web dApps to mobile devices, he added. The device also includes a web3-focused feature, the Seed Vault, which is embedded into the phone. Users can import a seed phrase from another crypto wallet or create a new one (Solana recommends creating a new one). You can read all about it here. As crypto startup valuations come back to Earth, big investors are bargain hunting (TC+) Crypto funding might have declined last quarter, but investors behind the largest funds in the space are sticking to their guns. “There’s always going to be a need for big funds and investors to help the startups get the funding they need,” Lydia Chiu, vice president of Business Development at Ava Labs, told TechCrunch+. With the current regulatory scrutiny on the space alongside the bearish market sentiment, venture capital funds are needed more than ever, she said. CeFi and DeFi in the face of regulation (TC+) The full magnitude of the impact of the current market volatility in the wake of the collapse of FTX is still unknown. The dominoes keep falling and it is hard to predict how many more projects and organizations will end up being affected. What is undisputed is how the entire industry has been impacted and that the conversation about crypto regulation has risen to the forefront. Twitter partners with eToro to show real-time stock and crypto information Twitter has partnered with the investment platform eToro to show real-time information about stocks and crypto prices. This expands upon the social network’s Cashtag feature, which provided info about a limited number of stocks and crypto coins through TradingView data.

414,Tinder’s verification process will now use AI and video selfies,['@sarahintampa'],"April 26, 2023","Tinder today is rolling out an AI-powered update to its Photo Verification feature, which to date has allowed the app’s users to prove to others they’re neither a bot nor a catfisher. In the past, users would take pictures of themselves, posing as instructed, to become verified on the dating app and receive a blue check. Now, Tinder is strengthening this process by requiring a video selfie instead of photos. Plus, it will soon allow users to restrict their chats to only those members who are also Photo Verified. The company says the changes are a part of Tinder’s work to make the app safer for its members. However, the feature also arrives at a time when it’s become much easier to leverage AI tools to create fake photos and personas, which could fill dating apps with fake people who are really just bots poised to spam their matches. Requiring a “liveness” check, as a video selfie does, is a much stronger means of vetting that people are who they say they are and weeding out spammers. Tinder says it’s outsourcing the technology for the video selfie to a third-party partner, but declined to name the vendor. The Photo Verification process itself is handled internally through its own infrastructure. However, it explains that the new model will first require the user to complete a series of video prompts, which the AI then uses to match that the person in the video also matches the person in the profile photo the user wants to verify. The integration works by matching a 3D mapping of someone’s likeness (their facial geometry) to their still photo. As the updates roll out, starting on Wednesday, users who aim to be Photo Verified or who want to maintain their existing verification will have to take a video selfie. The feature will fully replace the prior option to upload photos. Existing Photo Verified will soon begin to receive prompts in the app to upgrade to the latest version of Photo Verification if they want to keep their blue checkmarks on Tinder, the company notes. This not only ensures that members get verified through the more robust video selfie feature but also addresses the problem of lapsed Tinder users returning to the app where their verified photos are now years old. In addition to updating the feature to use videos instead of photos, Tinder will later introduce new features that allow users to only see other Photo Verified members in their recommendations, via their Message Settings. And it will allow members to ask their Matches to Photo Verify before they’re allowed to send a message. (It’s hard to imagine how this will make for a nice first impression, though!) Tinder Gold subscribers, meanwhile, will be able to filter their “Likes” page for Photo Verified members only. The company claims that Photo Verification has been proven to increase matches on the service, as users feel more assured that their potential match is a real person, not a bot — and that they look like their photos. Tinder says among its 18- to 25-year-old users, being Photo Verified gives them a 10% higher chance to match, for example. The Photo Verification feature will roll out today to Tinder’s global users while the ability to restrict messages to “Photo Verified Members” only will arrive in the “coming months,” Tinder says."
415,Yahoo acquires social sports betting app Wagr,['@psawers'],"April 25, 2023","Yahoo today announced that it has acquired Wagr, a three-year-old social sports betting startup based out of Nashville. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch, whose parent company happens to be the now Apollo-owned Yahoo, covered Wagr way back at its inception in 2020 at one of its early investor’s demo days. We noted at the time that Wagr is all about allowing sports fans to bet alongside peers, with challenges, leaderboards and tools for smack talk all part of the fun. In the intervening years, Wagr went on to raise some $16 million in funding from notable investors including esteemed New York VC firm Greycroft, Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six, Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and Kraft Group, owners of the New England Patriots. The Wagr app. Image Credits: Wagr The Wagr app. Image Credits: Wagr Yahoo is already one of the largest fantasy sports players in the U.S. alongside the likes of ESPN and DraftKings, and by bringing Wagr into the fold the company says that it will help accelerate Yahoo Sports’ “vision to create and deliver the most compelling fantasy and gaming products” through fostering camaraderie between friends. “While we know our fantasy leagues increase fan engagement and give people something to root for, the real value is in keeping friend groups together through competition and camaraderie around the sports they love,” Yahoo Sports SVP Jon Shaw said in a press release. “Acquiring Wagr creates an immediate opportunity for us to expand into new group formats that can take engagement and friendly competition to the next level.” Today’s announcement comes a little more than two months after Yahoo revealed it was laying off 20% of its staff, or 1,600 employees, from its ad tech business. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone said at the time that the layoffs were not a result of the economic downturn, but instead were changes it was proactively making to strengthen its unprofitable Yahoo for Business advertising unit. The Wagr acquisition, which is now closed, will see Wagr fully integrated into Yahoo Sports, meaning that Wagr will cease to exist as a standalone entity."
416,Appeals court rules in favor of Meta in antitrust case from state AGs,['@sarahintampa'],"April 27, 2023","Meta has won an antitrust lawsuit, under appeal, that pitted the tech giant against dozens of state attorneys general, led by New York. The states alleged Meta had illegally maintained monopoly power in the social networking market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, and that it gained further power through data policies that harmed app developers. “As the Court of Appeals rightly recognized, this case fundamentally mischaracterized the vibrant competitive ecosystem in which we operate,” a Meta spokesperson said, in a statement on the ruling. “In affirming the dismissal of this case, the court noted that this enforcement action was ‘odd’ because we compete in an industry that is experiencing ‘rapid growth and innovation with no end in sight.’ Moving forward, Meta will defend itself vigorously against the FTC’s distortion of antitrust laws and attacks on an American success story that are contrary to the interests of people and businesses who value our services,” they added. The plaintiffs, which included the attorneys general from 48 U.S. states and territories, had first sued Meta in December 2020, but a federal court dismissed their case in 2021, as well as a parallel case by the Federal Trade Commission, which could have ultimately resulted in Meta being required to divest of Instagram and WhatsApp. The states appealed the ruling in January 2022, arguing that the district court judge had wrongly terminated their case. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg had ruled that states had waited too long to challenge Meta’s acquisitions and that the policies they had cited were not illegal under antitrust law. The states, however, believed that their unprecedented delay to file “does not apply against sovereign states suing to protect the public interest, like the states here.” The states also believed the policies could violate antitrust law, so they appealed the case. The lower court had additionally granted the FTC leave to amend its complaint, allowing its case to proceed, as was reported last year. In terms of the states’ case, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has now upheld the district court’s ruling, calling the states’ lawsuit “not only odd, but old.” The court’s opinion further explains that the suit “concerns an industry that, even on the States’ allegations, has had rapid growth and innovation with no end in sight.” It then explains that as “sovereigns,” the states aren’t able to argue for an injunction under antitrust laws, because to be entitled to do so, they must be a “person, firm, corporation or association,” which they are not. The court also agreed with Judge Boasberg’s, decision that the States “unduly delayed” to file their suit. Facebook, (now Meta), had first acquired Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively, but the lawsuit wasn’t filed until December 2020. The district court had ruled that the long delays were “unreasonable and unjustified as a matter of law,” citing a four-year statute of limitations from other antitrust cases on other circuits as a guideline. The court also pointed out the acquisitions were well-publicized and went through lengthy, publicly reported FTC investigations to determine if they violated antitrust laws at the time. The appeals court also agreed with Judge Boasberg’s opinion regarding Facebook’s Platform and its practices and policies. The States had cited snippets of Facebook policies from 2011 and 2013, which the court said were “accurate, but the messages they seek to convey are not” — meaning, they didn’t make a case for antitrust law violations. “…we agree again with Judge Boasberg’s comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion determining that the States’ Platform-based allegations failed to state a cause of action,” the new opinion issued today states. It also agreed that the district court was correct that the States’ “exclusive dealing” theory fails as a matter of law, as it only limited apps on Facebook but left app developers free to develop applications for Facebook competitors. On other matters, the lateness of the lawsuit impacted the States’ ability to make its case, as it wanted injunctive relief for a policy that ended in 2018, giving Facebook platform access to companies that have long since shut down or pivoted their business. “Injunctive relief would be unwarranted even if the States could prove their allegations,” the court noted."
417,Threading the needle: 5 questions for National Grid Partners’ Lisa Lambert,['@dominicmadori'],"April 20, 2023","The Arctic is melting, while hurricanes, blizzards and heat waves leave millions of people and animals in disarray. Lisa Lambert, the head of National Grid’s CVC National Grid Partners, told TechCrunch+ that environmental and social concerns should be top of mind right now for any smart investor. “Not because it’s the right thing to do, but because there’s an enormous opportunity,” she said. Through her work, she invests in technology focused on climate change and mitigation. Though funding to climate startups dropped slightly in Q1, she sees that as a mere reflection of the overall venture downturn. “By no means do I see the beginning of a concerning trend.” Instead, she points to the fact that the International Energy Agency estimates that global investment in climate technology needs to hit $4 trillion a year by the end of this decade to meet the promises that government and corporations made of becoming net-zero; that’s four times more than it is right now. She expects the federal Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Industrial Plan to infuse billions of dollars into the sector; she estimates that trillions of dollars in private investment capital will be waiting to back scalable climate-focused technology. Through her work, she leads the charge. Lambert founded National Grid Partners in January 2018, when she and other leaders at the company realized it was best to “disrupt ourselves before we were disrupted.” National Grid is one of the largest utility companies in the world and owns various electric and natural gas networks to power the United Kingdom and the Northeastern United States. Lambert said the company is under a mandate from the British government to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2025. “Our CEO recognized that getting there would require new investments in technology to achieve the ‘three Ds’: digitalization, decentralization and decarbonization,” she said. Previously, Lambert was a GP at a clean tech fund and before that spent nearly two decades at Intel Capital, one of the world’s oldest and largest CVCs. She moved from Intel to climate tech because she had a thesis that the sector was due for a “renaissance” following the clean tech bubble collapse in the early 2000s. “And because, as a mother, I can’t think of a more important sector to invest in,” she said. She has a point: By 2050, which is the target to reach net-zero, the oldest of Generation Z will only be in their early 50s. “As a corporate VC, we’re measured not just on financial return but also on how much operational and strategic value our portfolio provides to our parent company,” Lambert said. Under her, NGP has allocated $400 million to 40 startups and four specialty funds in which NGP is a limited partner. It’s had seven exits to date, and five unicorns; for those interested in pitching, the fund is currently stage agnostic. At the same time, the firm has focused on opening doors for founders to enter the highly regulated and tough utility market while providing ways to further use technology to innovate a sector with a critical role in climate mitigation. I caught up with Lambert to ask her five questions about the future of NGP and the importance of her work."
418,"RapidAPI, valued at $1 billion last year, cuts staff by 50%",['@bayareawriter'],"April 25, 2023","Rapid (previously known as RapidAPI), a startup that built out an API marketplace valued at $1 billion last year, is cutting 50% of its staff TechCrunch has learned. According to an email to employees from CEO Marc Friend viewed by TechCrunch, the move is part of “a significant restructuring” in an effort to “right-size the company.” In the email, Friend said that Rapid tried “to compete on too many fronts” as a product company. He added: “We have grown large as an organization and often sacrificed agility. Moving forward, we will be disciplined on our product focus and ruthless about customer success.” Friend only last week took over the role of chief executive of the company. CEO and founder Iddo Gino is now a technical advisor, per a company announcement. The layoffs are believed to have impacted 115 people and are hitting workers across Europe, Tel Aviv and San Francisco, according to a source familiar with internal happenings at the company. The email — which went out on Monday — said only that “a large number” of employees would be let go “in the next few days.” Workers across several departments — including sales, talent acquisition, engineering, product and marketing — are said to have been affected. The company has confirmed to TechCrunch that it expects to reduce its team size “by around 50% and close all open roles,” but it declined to confirm the specific number of individuals affected. In a statement via email, a spokesperson said: “Following the path of many technology companies recently, our new incoming CEO and the Board have made the difficult decision to implement a restructuring and will be saying goodbye to many of our friends and colleagues. The decision to reduce the number of employees and rebalance investments is one we don’t take lightly.” RapidAPI built a platform that helps businesses find and integrate third-party APIs, as well as manage their own usage of their own internal APIs. It raised $150 million in March of 2022 in a Series D round led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. Other backers include Qumra, Andreessen Horowitz, M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund), Viola Growth, Green Bay and Grove Ventures.  Last November, RapidAPI announced it had rebranded to Rapid and that more than 4 million developers used its public API hub. That hub, it claimed, had grown to among the world’s largest — giving developers the ability to integrate more than 40,000 APIs from companies such as Twilio, Microsoft and Google. At the time, it touted new enterprise customers such as ATA, Poly, Formula 1’s Scuderia AlphaTauri and Sun Life Financial. It also boasted that it had doubled its company employees in the past year — to 200. RapidAPI also opened a new European headquarters in Berlin last July.

419,SEC charges founder of financial aid startup Frank with defrauding JPMorgan,['@bayareawriter'],"April 4, 2023","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Charlie Javice, the founder of student financial aid startup Frank, with fraud in connection with the $175 million sale of the company to JPMorgan Chase Bank in 2021.  JPMorgan filed a lawsuit against Javice in December, alleging that she had helped “fake millions of customers in order to induce the bank to buy her company.” That charge is the root of the SEC’s complaint today, which charges that Javice “made numerous misrepresentations” about Frank’s purported millions of users to entice JPMorgan. The complaint alleges that as talks between the two parties progressed, JPMorgan pressed Frank executives for data associated with its customers. Javice allegedly sought the help of Frank’s director of engineering to generate synthetic data to make it appear as if Frank had 4.25 million customers. And when that director refused to cooperate, Javice then allegedly paid a data science professor $18,000 to manufacture the data “required to close the deal.” The young entrepreneur denies those claims and in turn filed her own suit against the bank, charging that the bank had let her go in November “in bad faith.” For its part, JPMorgan claims that it found out about the alleged fraud when it sent out marketing test emails to a list of Frank’s customers provided by the company and more than 70% of them bounced back.  As part of the acquisition, Javice reportedly received $9.7 million directly in stock proceeds, millions more indirectly through trusts as well as a contract entitling her to a $20 million retention bonus as a new employee of JPMorgan Chase. “Rather than help students, we allege that Ms. Javice engaged in an old school fraud: she lied about Frank’s success in helping millions of students navigate the college financial aid process by making up data to support her claims, and then used that fake information to induce JPMC to enter into a $175 million transaction,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, in a written statement. “Even non-public, early-stage companies must be truthful in their representations, and when they fall short we will hold them accountable as in this case.” The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Javice with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint also names trusts held by Javice as relief defendants. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, an officer and director bar, disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties. Since the lawsuit was filed, there has been a lot of back-and-forth between the two parties. JPMorgan Chase has since described the acquisition as “a huge mistake.” In January, the bank shut down Frank’s website. And in March, Javice filed a counterclaim, saying it was “implausible” that JP Morgan “was led to believe Frank had 4.25 million registered users when its website publicly claimed the company had helped more than 350,000 people access financial aid.” She also claims that the bank could not have been misled about the business, pointing to due diligence materials and valuation data.

420,Spotify debuts ‘Niche Mixes’ you can build based on description alone,['@indianidle'],"March 28, 2023","Spotify launched a new feature today called Niche Mixes that lets you create your own personalized mixes based on just a few words of description in the Search tab. For instance, you could type in an “activity, vibe or aesthetic,” the company notes, then append the word “mix” to generate the custom playlist. This new feature is available to all free and premium users in English starting today. The company describes this feature as “a set of personalized playlists that combines all that our Mixes offer in a playful way.” “We’re giving listeners access to tens of thousands of Mixes unique to them based on, well, almost anything they can think of,” Spotify said in a blog post. The feature allows users to instantly generate a playlist for almost anything. For example, you can search for “Feel good morning mix,” “90s running mix” or “driving singalong mix,” among other things. The Niche Mixes will have a “Made For You” label below the name in search results. You can find these playlists under “Your Niche Mixes” in the “Made For You” hub located under search, after their creation. In addition, Spotify will suggest a carousel of 5-10 Niche Mixes made for you, which are updated every day. Spotify suggested a few Niche Mixes to get users started, including its Cottagecore Indie Mix, Bubblegum Pop Mix, Discofox Mix, Feel Good Driving Mix, Fun Road Trip Mix, Travel Mashup Mix and others. Spotify wants you to be creative with your prompts by inputting decades, activities or vibes to get results. In tests, TechCrunch reporters found the feature was able to generate a wide number of results. Even typing in the words “shower mix” in the search box returns rows and rows of possible mixes, demonstrating the feature’s possible scale. Image Credits: TechCrunch Image Credits: TechCrunch However, you may run into keyword combinations that don’t offer results if they’re not terms that could not be tied to music somehow. Plus, there are some holes in the coverage, as the service was able to return a “cooking mix” but not a “cooking dinner mix,” for instance. The streamer would not be the first app to try a feature that generates a list with a prompt. An app called LineupSupply renamed itself to Playlist AI and added a playlist generator that works by text input — something that may have pushed Spotify to develop this feature. However, the feature is not AI-powered, despite its initial appearance. Spotify tells us it’s driven by the company’s personalization tech and algorithms. Spotify has been revamping its app in recent weeks with a number of AI-powered features. In February, the company launched an AI DJ feature, which plays personalized songs along with AI-powered spoken commentary. Additional reporting: Sarah Perez; TC also corrected a typo “5-10” mixes, not “5-19” as earlier stated. "
421,Forest Admin launches cloud version of its low-code internal tool builder,['@romaindillet'],"April 5, 2023","French startup Forest Admin is launching a cloud-based version of its product. The company helps you create flexible back-end admin panels for operations teams. Essentially, Forest Admin helps development teams spend less time on back office tools so they can focus on the actual product. With the cloud version, companies just have to integrate the service with their own SQL database. After that, they can start using Forest Admin to manage their business. “The onboarding is very similar to business intelligence tools,” Forest Admin co-founder and CEO Sandro Munda told me. But BI tools mostly fetch data so that it can be transformed, analyzed and compiled into quarterly reports and reused in business planning meetings. Forest Admin is all about interacting with your product’s data. Companies can also integrate the admin panel with third-party services like Stripe, Mixpanel and Intercom. Forest Admin users can then trigger actions and create workflows with different levels of permission in the company. Unlike other internal tool builders, such as Retool, Forest Admin is focused on admin panels exclusively. It isn’t designed to be an all-in-one internal tool builder because sophisticated services also tend to be complex. For instance, a fintech company could use Forest Admin to review and validate documents and make sure it complies with KYC and AML regulation (“know your customer” and “anti-money laundering”) — Qonto is one of the startup’s biggest customers, with 2,000 people using Forest Admin. An e-commerce company could also use Forest Admin to refund customers or order an item once again in case it’s been lost. In addition to centralizing all your data, a tool like Forest Admin also makes it easier to interact with your data. Companies can filter their user base and create segments, update and delete records and more. Currently, Forest Admin customers install a component on their servers. This agent can read your data and makes it accessible through an API. Forest Admin hosts the front-end interface on its own servers. When customers connect to their admin panels, Forest Admin fetches information from the component that is installed on your infrastructure. With the new cloud version, it greatly lowers the barrier to entry as you don’t have to install Forest Admin’s component on your servers. With the right firewall rules and tunneling software, your database should remain secure. “There’s no data duplication, you make changes on your database directly,” Munda said. “Our goal is really to attract a new segment of customers,” he added. Previously, you needed to integrate Forest’s agent in your own application. If a company is already using high-level cloud services exclusively, they couldn’t use Forest Admin before the release of the cloud-based version. Many operations-driven companies already use Forest Admin, such as fintech, marketplace, mobility and healthcare companies. “We are close to profitability but it isn’t what we’re aiming for right now,” Munda said. And the cloud product should help when it comes to bringing more revenue."
422,Distressed Indian startup GoMechanic acquired by Lifelong Group-led consortium,['@refsrc'],"March 29, 2023","A consortium led by Lifelong Group has acquired distressed firm GoMechanic, months after the Sequoia India-backed startup admitted “grave errors” in financial reporting. The New Delhi-headquartered Lifelong Group, which serves several major players in the automotive industry including Hero and General Motors, said it won the auction to acquire GoMechanic, whose investors scrambled to sell the company earlier this year. “This transaction will assist in preserving the ecosystem at large and also enable providing continued livelihood to the employees at GoMechanic,” said Lifelong Group, now a majority investor in GoMechanic, in a statement. The acquisition caps an embarrassing episode in the Indian startup community after it became apparent that GoMechanic founders had misstated facts, inflated revenue figures, kept investors in the dark, and attempted to raise new funding under false pretenses. GoMechanic operates 800 workshops and serviced 30,000 vehicles in January, Lifelong Group said. High-profile backers including Tiger Global, an existing investor in GoMechanic, SoftBank, and Malaysia’s Khazanah evaluated fresh investment in GoMechanic last year, but decided against it for various reasons. A probe ordered by existing backers into GoMechanic, which offers auto-services such as repairing and car washing, found that many of its garages were fictitious, in addition to other problems, TechCrunch previously reported. With no new funding in sight, GoMechanic scrambled to cut expenses and laid off 70% of its workforce. The seven-year-old startup had raised more than $60 million over the years and was looking to increase its valuation to $1.2 billion last year. The startup’s valuation was slashed to $30 million in recent weeks."
423,Twitter removes ‘government-funded’ news labels after NPR and other flubs,['@asilbwrites'],"April 21, 2023","After weeks of truly stupid antics, Twitter has removed “government-funded media” labels on all accounts, from NPR to the Chinese state-affiliated Xinhua News. Twitter even appears to have deleted its web page explaining the “government-funded media” labels. This whole saga started when Twitter labeled NPR as “state-affiliated,” a designation that Twitter reserves for publications where the government exercises influence or control over editorial decisions. But NPR receives about 1% of its funding from the government and operates with editorial independence. So, Twitter created a new “government-funded media” label for NPR, which is a bit less misleading, yet still could easily give users the wrong idea about the accuracy of its news. NPR ended up leaving Twitter, with its CEO saying he has lost his faith in the decision-making at Twitter. Twitter doubled down, adding “government-funded” labels to media outlets like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC Australia), Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), New Zealand’s public broadcaster RNZ, Sweden’s SR Ekot and SVT and Catalonia’s TV3.cat. In one particularly asinine act, Twitter assigned the CBC a “69% government-funded media” label, since the network claimed it was less than 70% government-funded, and as we very well-know, Twitter owner Elon Musk has the same sense of humor as a high school freshman on Reddit. This prompted the CBC to follow NPR’s lead and leave Twitter altogether. And now we’ve come full-circle. Just like legacy blue checks, the government-funded media labels have disappeared. So it goes.  "
424,Kevin Costner’s location-based audio storytelling app Autio raises $5.9M,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 29, 2023","Autio, a location-based audio entertainment app co-founded by actor Kevin Costner and formerly known as HearHere, has raised $5.9 million in a second seed round with new terms. The funding round was led by iHeartMedia. Autio uses GPS to narrate stories of landmarks, cities and towns nearby with the aim of fostering deep connections and understandings of the places users are traveling through. Founded by CEO Woody Sears, Bill Werlin and Costner, Autio initially launched as HearHere in August 2020 with just 1,500 location-based stories. Autio now offers more than 10,000 stories across the entire United States and has more than 230,000 registered users. Although Autio is currently only available on iOS, the company is currently testing an Android app in private beta and plans to release it to the public soon. The stories, which range from two to four minutes in length, are designed to give listeners informational tidbits about their surroundings, including points of interest they might not have known about. Some of the stories are narrated by notable names, such as Costner himself, along with actors John Lithgow and Phil Jackson. Free accounts come with five stories, while paid accounts cost $36 per year and come with unlimited access. Once users enable location access, they can explore nearby stories when traveling. When not traveling, users can still access the map of the United States and find content to listen to based on their interests. Sears told TechCrunch that although most of its users listen to stories on road trips, many use the app on planes, while walking and even traveling virtually from home. This was why the company rebranded, as Sears and the team believed that the name “HearHere” was only being associated with listening to a story at its actual location, whereas the company wanted to refocus on audio for travel. Image Credits: Autio Image Credits: Autio Sears says the new funding will go toward expanding the app’s content library, reaching new audiences and growing the startup’s team. The funding will also be used to continue expanding into additional regions throughout the United States. “We’ll be launching enterprise integrations to surface our content in new and interesting ways,” Sears said. “We also have more community-focused features to encourage story sharing and discovery rolling out over the course of this year. Additionally, we’re piloting new markets for international expansion.” The funding round included participation from Stonks, Cooley Law, Blue 9 Capital, Seraph Group, Eric Ries and Kern Venture Group. The extended seed round follows Autio’s $3.2 million seed investment announced last year, which came a year after the company’s $1.6 million pre-seed round in 2021. The latest round brings the total amount of money raised by Autio to $10.7 million. In addition to leading the latest funding round, iHeartMedia is also launching a marketing partnership with the startup. Autio says the partnership will allow it to reach new audiences through iHeartMedia’s multiplatform audio network, which includes broadcast radio, podcast, digital, social and live events. Image Credits: Autio Image Credits: Autio The funding announcement comes during the same month that Autio appeared on Shark Tank. The company says that although Sears turned down a $1 million investment offer from Kevin O’Leary, the app did see an increase in downloads and subscribers immediately following the airing of the episode. Autio saw its app downloads increase by 464%, new subscribers increased by 105% and website traffic was up over 1,600%. Autio also announced its first in-flight integration with JetBlue earlier this month, giving JetBlue customers access to audio content for 29 of their destination cities in the United States via their seatback screens. In terms of the company’s plans for the future, Sears says Autio is going after a bold vision of becoming the global platform for local stories. “It all starts with the power of a single story to delight a listener and connect them with a place or person,” Sears said. “On a global scale, we envision millions of these types of connections made every day as users get to explore the broader world around them through this very personal medium.”    "
425,Lawmakers call on USPS to combat surge in ‘change of address’ fraud,['@zackwhittaker'],"March 28, 2023","A group of bipartisan lawmakers has called on the U.S. Postal Service to strengthen its internal processes to reduce change of address fraud, which each year allows fraudsters to redirect thousands of people’s mail, including bills, checks and bank statements. U.S. Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ, 5th) and other House lawmakers want USPS to make it more difficult for fraudsters to hijack a person’s mail by ensuring USPS verifies the identity of the person submitting the change of address request. In the bipartisan letter to U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump administration appointee who oversees USPS, the House lawmakers are also pushing USPS to allow anyone the ability to freeze an address change, just as someone would freeze their credit report to prevent fraud. “Change of address fraud is costing our families millions of dollars and it’s costing trust in their local post office. Unfortunately, because of an egregious lack of oversight and action at the post office, far too many residents have to worry that they could be the next victim of change of address fraud,” said Rep. Gottheimer in a presser on Monday. The bipartisan letter comes soon after TechCrunch reported the case of a former Microsoft executive whose mail was rerouted by criminals who filed an address change on the former executive’s behalf. It’s a low-tech hack that can have major consequences, including loss of earnings and identity theft. The former executive caught the bogus address change quickly, but thousands of other victims each year aren’t so lucky. Change of address fraud exploits gaps in how USPS handles the change to a person’s address when they move. Most people request to change their address online for a small fee of $1.10 to help prevent fraud, yet many still rely on filing a paper change of address form at their local USPS post office branch. USPS processed more than 36 million changes of address in 2021 alone, but the number of victims caught out by change of address fraud is rising every year. The post office’s watchdog, the USPS’ inspector general, recorded more than 23,000 cases in 2021 where someone had fraudulently filed a change of address request with USPS. A spokesperson for the USPS inspector general told TechCrunch at the time that USPS is supposed to check a person’s government ID — like a passport or driver’s license — when filing a paper change of address form. TechCrunch found that USPS relies almost entirely on trusting the person signing the paper form, often without any verification checks at all. Gottheimer said the “shocking surge” in change of address fraud is also affecting victims in his New Jersey district, including one local resident whose address was fraudulently changed without their consent allowing criminals to obtain her bills, bank statements and Social Security number. “Families deserve to know that the Postal Service is doing everything they can to ensure their mail, checks, bank info, veterans benefits, tax returns, Social Security checks and life-saving medications are safe from thieves,” said Gottheimer.

426,"After a turbulent few years for home fitness, Tonal gets fresh funding and new CEO",['@bheater'],"April 12, 2023","The early days of the pandemic proved a massive boon for the home fitness crowd. Gyms closed indefinitely, and even when they began reopening, many members seriously questioned whether the model would continue to suit their life, moving forward. Peloton, for one, was in a perfect place to capitalize on the trend, with a significant head start from the pack. Ultimately, however, the company overshot it. It seemed clear to casual observers that — while the category would gain some lasting momentum — reality would eventually set in as the world reopened, sending many crashing back down to earth. Of course, woes from companies like Peloton and Mirror weren’t the product of any one thing. Weight training platform Tonal has also had its own struggles in recent years. Last July, it confirmed that it had let go 35% of its staff, noting that the move was the “responsible” choice amid continued headwinds. “Tonal is prioritizing becoming a self-sustaining business with an emphasis on profitability,” the company told TechCrunch. “While sales have continued to grow at an unprecedented rate, so have the costs of our business, particularly in light of the macroeconomic climate and global supply chain challenges.” Tonal’s team, pre-pandemic. Image Credits: Tonal. Tonal’s team, pre-pandemic. Image Credits: Tonal. This week, founder Aly Orady stepped down from his role as CEO, effective immediately. In his wake, Tonal’s president, Krystal Zell, is stepping into the top spot, nine months after joining the company. According to the company, her initial position put her in charge of “revenue, sales and marketing, product, and content.” Prior to joining Tonal, she spent five years as Home Depot’s Chief Customer Officer, with a focus on e-commerce. Speaking with TechCrunch, Zell says her rapid ascension to the top spot was not Tonal’s plan from the start. “I was happy to take on the challenge,” she says. “I think a big part of it was just trying to figure it out as the market was shifting from a massive growth at all costs into a measured growth and path to profitability. I think it worked out really well, because the skills I was able to bring to the table are more about how to drive very disciplined, profitable growth.” Orady is staying on at the company, but is shifting to a more technology-centered role as CTO — a desire Zell says was at the heart of his decision to walk away from the chief executive spot. “Aly and I have a very symbiotic relationship,” she adds, “because we really complement each others’ strengths and capabilities. He missed focusing on technology, because the last two to three years of running the business took him out of that focus and had him focusing on dealing with all of the challenges that hypergrowth created.” Shifting away from “growth at all costs” had some human collateral. Zell’s role as president was announced the same month Tonal laid off nearly one-third of its staff. That, at least, is a familiar story. The most notable example in the category is, once again, Peloton’s. The scale is a dramatically different one. At the time of its layoffs, Tonal’s headcount was reported as around 750. Peloton, on the other hand, underwent four rounds of layoffs in 2022, with 2,800 cuts in February, 540 in July, 784 in August and around 500 in October. Zell says her primary focuses have been on marketing and channel. The company doesn’t disclose the location of its manufacturing for fear of losing a “competitive advantage,” though domestic/local manufacture and assembly have clearly been top of mind for many big-ticket home fitness makers, particularly in the wake of years of supply chain constraints. On the marketing side, that means casting a smaller, more targeted net. At the height of the connected fitness crazy, high-cost national advertisements were suddenly par for the course, in a bid to capture the attention of consumers who suddenly found themselves stuck at home. “We were doing a ton of top line marketing, driving brand awareness and a lot of TV advertising,” says Zell. “We did get great brand awareness, but we’ve shifted into a bottom of funnel approach to marketing to really hone in on performance and reduced a lot of that top of funnel marketing, in order to be as effective as possible.” Tonal Device. Image Credits: Tonal. Tonal Device. Image Credits: Tonal. Along with the executive suite shakeup, Tonal announced a new round of funding. The company has raised $130 million, led by L Catterton, Cobalt, Dragoneer, Kindred Ventures and THVC. In spite of shifts in the category, layoffs and broader macro trends, Zell says finding backers wasn’t an issue this time around. “We have outstanding investors,” she says, “and they really believe in Tonal. They believe in the business and were extremely supportive.” The company isn’t disclosing valuation at the time. The raise is a little over half of the $250 million Series E it drummed up in 2021, which cemented its unicorn status with a $1.6 billion valuation. Growth was clearly the name of the game back then, with Orady noting at the time, “We’re really getting ready to scale the business: we’re pouring a lot more capital into marketing and brand awareness, and we’re pouring a lot more capital into scaling our supply chain to get ready for the next phase, which I really think is the next two holiday seasons.” For reasons highlighted above, priorities have shifted considerably. Among other things, Tonal was ultimately saddled with too much inventory. “We’ve done a ton of work to work through that,” says Zell. “As we get through the completion of fundraising, the outcome of that is, within a very short amount of time, we will have a supply chain that is nicely lined up to match.” Other key changes include potentially adjusting the product roadmap to match consumer demand, and exploring additional brick and mortar options. Currently the Tonal system is available in five stores, along with some Nordstrom locations, which offer user demos. For all of the rapid growth, Tonal wasn’t nearly as aggressive on the retail front as Peloton, which ended up closing a significant number of its stores alongside layoffs. Zell says the company is “really close” to achieving profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis following nine months of difficult choices. As for a future IPO, she says “that will be a possibility at some point in the future. Not near term, but a potential longer-term future.”"

428,Tesla’s strategy to fuel EV sales? Keep cutting prices,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 7, 2023","Tesla may be a relative newcomer compared to legacy companies like GM and Ford, but it has adopted an age-old tactic in the industry: price wars. The automaker has lowered the sticker price on its vehicles in the U.S. and China numerous times since last fall. And any speculation that the cuts would stop in 2023 ended in January when Tesla drastically slashed prices by as much as 20%. Now, the company is lowering prices again. Tesla reduced the price of its higher-end and aging Model S and Model X vehicles by $5,000 each, according to its website. The base Model S, a dual motor all-wheel-drive variant, is now $84,990. The Model X is $94,990. The Model 3 sedan and Model Y are also lower by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively. Tesla has cut prices in the U.S. as requirements to qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit tighten. Tesla has said that based on new IRS guidance, the $7,500 credit will be reduced for Model 3 rear-wheel drive on April 18 to $3,750. While lowering prices may boost sales, it comes at a cost. Tesla has enjoyed one of the higher automotive margins in the sector. Selling its vehicles for lower prices could chip away at that profit margin unless it can reduce costs elsewhere. And the price reductions can’t go on forever. The price reduction trend kicked off in October when Tesla announced price cuts in China up to 9% on the Model 3 and Model Y. Already this year, the price of the base Model Y is 20% lower than it was at the end of 2022. The price cuts have persisted as Tesla pushes to scale its operations and produce 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. CEO Elon Musk said during the company’s Q4 and full-year earnings call in January that the company has “the potential to do 2 million cars this year.” Tesla said Sunday it delivered 422,875 electric vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, just beating Wall Street estimates of around 420,000 units. The company produced 440,808 vehicles in the same period. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered 405,278 and produced 439,701 units. Those Q4 deliveries were also record results, but they missed Wall Street expectations."
429,Ford to build next-gen EV truck at $5.6B factory in 2025,['@kirstenkorosec'],"March 24, 2023","Ford said Friday that its $5.6 billion BlueOval City complex outside of Memphis, Tennessee will include a truck plant capable of producing 500,000 electric vehicles a year. The first vehicle to come off the line will be a next-gen electric truck, code named Project T3, in 2025. Construction at BlueOval City, the epicenter for its future EV and battery cell manufacturing and a key component toward its goal to sell 2 million EVs annually by late 2026, began last fall. “BlueOval City is the blueprint for Ford’s electric future around the world,” Bill Ford, Ford’s executive chair, said in a statement. “We will build revolutionary electric vehicles at an advanced manufacturing site that works in harmony with the planet, aligning business growth and innovation with environmental progress.” Image Credits: Ford Image Credits: Ford The T3, which Ford says stands for Trust the Truck, will be a clean sheet design, unlike its current EV truck, the F-150 Lightning. The T3 will be a “software-defined” vehicle capable of over-the-air updates, the company said. The automaker is developing its second-generation EV truck alongside the all-new assembly plant in an effort to increase operating efficiencies, an area where Ford has struggled. The general assembly footprint will be 30% smaller than traditional plants while delivering higher production capacity, the company said. The plant will also use carbon-free electricity from the day it opens. Ford will use recovered energy from the site’s utility infrastructure and geothermal system to provide carbon-free heat for the assembly plant, a decision that the company said will save about 300 million cubic feet of natural gas typically needed each year to heat similarly sized vehicle assembly plants. Other energy and water saving technologies will be used on the 3,600-acre campus, such as a zero-waste-to-landfill site designed to use no fresh water for its assembly processes."
430,Locus Robotics CEO on the future of warehouse automation,['@bheater'],"March 28, 2023","Any doubts that ProMat has become a robotics event were laid to rest the moment you walked on the floor at Chicago’s McCormick Place. Locus Robotics planted its flag in a big, expensive way front and center in the convention center’s south hall. In less than a decade of existence, Locus has become one of the biggest names in the category and is teetering on the edge of an IPO. We climbed to the second floor of the company’s ProMat booth to sit down with Rick Faulk, who assumed the CEO role in 2016. The executive discusses the company’s birth as 3PL firm Quiet Logistics, growth and what the future looks like for automating warehouses. TechCrunch: Yours is largely a brownfield solution. RF: Both brownfield and greenfield. About 23% of our business right now is actually in greenfield buildings. We started in brownfield, but the great thing about Locus is we can go into both. Some other solutions can only go into brownfield — Fetch can do it, 6 Rivers can do it, Locus can do it, and that’s really about it. It’s really hard to go into buildings that were never designed to be automated, and deploying it by making minimal infrastructural changes is really hard to do. In a greenfield building, if you’re given cart blanche, what does that look like? We have a number of clients now that I can’t mention by name who do greenfield deployments, and the building is actually designed specifically for Locus. The great thing about it is it really doesn’t require any great design work — we can operate in most any aisle. But the design is for maximum efficiency. You’ve got an ideal induction area in the middle of the space, you’ve got a pack area that’s around the outside. And in most of these buildings, we do replen[ish] as well. The other day, I was in one building for a very large footwear manufacturer who actually has trucks that back up into the building. Robots take cases right off the truck. You do truck unloading? You’ll see some solutions [at ProMat] that automate going in and actually grabbing the box. Once the boxes come off the truck, they go onto the robots and then go to the right area of the building. Adding payloads onto the robots is mostly being done manually? Yes. If you happen to go to [the North Hall], you’ll see the Fanuc booth demonstrating an arm. It places one of the totes on a robot, and after a pick, the arm removes it. Generally it’s done with humans, but we’re experimenting with automating that whole process. Why try build your own robotic arm in-house if a lot of people already do it really well? That’s the last thing you want to do. It’s a discipline in itself. A lot of folks are really good at it. Our best approach is to integrate with them and not redesign it. How are the robots communicating with one another? We have an open API where we do communicate. With Berkshire Grey, our system talks to them, and it also talks to the WMS [warehouse management system]. Our system speaks to the WMS first, and it asks, ‘what are the ideal numbers and orders that should go on this robot to fill out the wall?’ The same thing goes for any sort of integration we do. So you potentially have the foundation to automate the entire process. We absolutely do that today. It’s not a dream. Lights out? It’s not lights out. Lights out might happen 10 years from now, but the ROI is not there to do it today. It may be there down the road. We’ve got advanced product groups working on some things that are looking at how to get more labor out of the equation. Our strategy is to minimize labor over time. We’re doing integrations with Berkshire Grey and others to minimize labor. To get to a dark building is going to be years away. Have you explored front-of-house — retail or restaurants? We have a lot of calls about restaurants. Our strategy is to focus. There are 135,000 warehouses out there that have to be automated. Less than 5% are automated today. I was in Japan recently, and my meal was filled by a robot. I look around and say, ‘hey, we could do that.’ But it’s a different market. What is the safety protocol? If a robot and I are walking toward each other on the floor, will it stop first? It will stop or they’ll navigate around. It’s unbelievably smart. If you saw what happened on the back end — it’s dynamically planning paths in real time. Each robot is talking to other robots. This robot will tell this robot over here, ‘you can’t get through here, so go around.’ If there’s an accident, we’ll go around it. They’re all creating a large, cloud-based map together in real time. That’s exactly what it is. When was the company founded? 2014. We actually spun out of a company called Quiet Logistics. It was a 3PL. We were fully automated with Kiva. Amazon bought Kiva in 2012, and said, ‘we’re going to take the product off the market.’ We looked for another robot and couldn’t find one, so we decided to build one. The form factors are similar. Their form factor is basically the bottom. It goes under a shelf and brings the shelf back to the station to do a pick. The great thing about our solution is we can go into a brownfield building. They’re great and they work, but it will also take four times the number of robots to do the same work our robots do. Amazon keeps coming up in my conversations in the space as a motivator for warehouses to adopt technologies to remain competitive. But there’s an even deeper connection here. Amazon is actually our best marketing organization. They’re setting the bar for SLAs (service level agreements). Every single one of these 3PLs walking around here have to do same- or next-day delivery, because that’s what’s being demanded by their clients. Do the systems’ style require in-person deployment? The interesting thing during COVID is we actually deployed a site over FaceTime. Someone walked around the warehouse with a phone? Yeah. It’s not our preferred method. They probably actually did a better job than we did. It was terrific. As far as efficiency, that could make a lot of sense, moving forward. Yeah. It does still require humans to go in, do the installation and training — that sort of thing. I think it will be a while before we get away from that. But it’s not hard to do. We take folks off the street, train them and in a month they know how to deploy. Where are they manufactured? We manufacture them in Boston, believe it or not. We have contract manufacturers manufacturing some components, like the base and the mast. And then we integrate them together in Boston. We do the final assembly and then do all the shipments. As you expand sales globally, are there plans to open additional manufacturing sites? We will eventually. Right now we’re doing some assemblies in Amsterdam. We’re doing all refurbishments for Europe in Amsterdam. […] There’s a big sustainability story, too. Sustainability is really important to big clients like DHL. Ours is an inherently green model. We have over 12,000 robots in the field. You can count the number of robots we’ve scrapped on two hands. Everything gets recycled to the field. A robot will come back after three or four years and we’ll rewrap it. We may have to swap out a camera, a light or something. And then it goes back into service under a RaaS model. What happened in the cases where they had to be scrapped. They got hit by forklifts and they were unrepairable. I mean crushed. Any additional fundraising on the horizon? We’ve raised about $430 million, went through our Series F. Next leg in our financing will be an IPO. Probably. We have the numbers to do it now. The market conditions are not right to do it, for all the reasons you know. Do you have a rough timeline? It will be next year, but the markets have got to recover. We don’t control that."
431,New Withings scale hides the heavy burden of knowing your own weight,['@Haje'],"April 19, 2023","Today, 14 years after the company introduced its first smart scale, health gadget startup Withings is introducing the Body Smart scale. The $100 scale is the baby brother in the company’s smart scale line, which also includes the $200 Body Comp and the $400 Body Scan scales. The scale includes a color screen (snazzy!) and an “Eyes Closed” mode, where the scale hides the user’s weight — it’s tracked in the app but not shown on the screen. An excellent addition for folks who might want to track their weight over time or share their health data with a doctor or nutritionist but don’t necessarily need to know their own ebb and flow of weight throughout the week. The entry-level scale combines multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), precision weight sensors and advanced algorithms, delivering insights and health analysis. The company says it provides precise weight and body composition analysis as well as advanced health measurements, including heart rate, visceral fat, metabolic age and basal metabolic rate. All of the measurements show up in the company’s app, which can sync to other health data apps (such as Apple’s and Google’s fitness apps). There’s nothing black and white about health. But the scales, are. Image Credits: Withings There’s nothing black and white about health. But the scales, are. Image Credits: Withings The company’s BIA tech works by sending a small electrical signal through the body, which measures the resistance and reactance of body tissues to the current. By using multiple frequencies, the company says it can create a more complete picture of body health. Instead of their weight, users can opt to see motivational messages or daily information such as step counts, air quality and the weather. “Body Smart is a fantastic addition to the Withings smart scale lineup and one of the most feature-rich scales at its price point on the market,” said Mathieu Letombe, CEO of Withings in a statement to TechCrunch. “Designed to improve users’ lives, Body Smart elevates the market by providing highly precise and accurate readings along with insightful and actionable health data and advice. It brings a new level of precision and clarity to the complexities of health in a beautifully designed device that fits in any home.” The new scale is available today."
432,"Proton announces Proton Pass, a password manager",['@romaindillet'],"April 20, 2023","Proton, the Geneva, Switzerland-based company behind the end-to-end encrypted email service Proton Mail, as well as Proton VPN, Proton Drive and Proton Calendar, is announcing a brand new product today. And it’s a password manager called Proton Pass. Like other Proton products, the company is insisting on the privacy and security features of this new password manager. Everything you store in Proton Pass is end-to-end encrypted, including passwords (obviously), email addresses, URLs and notes. This way, Proton never has access to your personal information as the user key is required to decrypt data and cryptographic operations occur locally on your device. Even if Proton’s servers are breached, your data should still be safe. “This is important because seemingly innocuous bits of information (such as saved URLs, which many other password managers don’t encrypt) can be used to create a highly detailed profile on you. For example, if an attacker can see that you have passwords saved for an account with Grindr, gop.com or even a manga fan site, they’ll know a lot about you as a person, even if they can’t actually access your accounts,” Proton’s founder and CEO Andy Yen wrote in a blog post. A beta version of Proton Pass is available to loyal Proton customers, such as users who have a lifetime plan. Customers with a Visionary plan will be able to access the product shortly. The Visionary plan is no longer available to new customers. Proton Pass is also the result of the acquisition of SimpleLogin, an email alias startup. The SimpleLogin team worked on Proton Pass with a few team members of the Proton team. Like with Proton VPN and the company’s other products, the company plans to use a freemium business model when it rolls out Proton Pass to everyone. Some features will be available for free, while you will have to pay for a subscription to access advanced features. Proton offers an all-in-one subscription, Proton Unlimited, with all the paid features in Proton Mail, Proton VPN, Proton Drive and Proton Calendar. Advanced Proton Pass features will also be included in this premium subscription tier. Proton Pass is currently available as a desktop browser extension, and iOS or Android app. Browser extensions work in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Customers can also use Proton Pass as their two-factor authenticator (like Bitwarden, 1Password or iCloud Passwords). In other news, Proton has recently reached an important milestone, as there are 100 million registered users across all of the company’s products. Of course, Proton has a free tier for all its services, including Proton VPN, which means that there are likely more free users than paid users. But it also means that Proton has no issue attracting new users to its products. Image Credits: Proton Image Credits: Proton"
433,Pitch Deck Teardown: Honeycomb’s $50M Series D deck,['@Haje'],"April 20, 2023","Honeycomb raised $50 million to make the new landscape of platforms and services more observable. Its long-term goal is to make life easier for people operating large software platforms. “What we saw in 2015 and 2016 is the world moving in a direction where that complexity was unavoidable, whether in a heightened interest in being able to do things like breakdown by customer ID or this exploding complexity that was about to come onto the scene driven by Kubernetes, microservices and containers. We [believed] the world [was] going to need a tool like this that allows users to have both speed and flexibility,” Christine Yen, co-founder and CEO at Honeycomb, told TechCrunch in a previous interview. I find this fascinating and was excited to go through the company’s pitch deck to learn more. We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.  The company didn’t remove any slides from its 18-slide deck, but it redacted revenue numbers and blurred customer and competitor logos. This is a quick breakdown of the honey Honeycomb used to land $50 million in the hive: Honeycomb is building a product that — based on its traction alone — is clearly needed, and it does a good job weaving its story. [Slide 17] Look at that! Yess!! Image Credits: Honeycomb
One of my pet peeves about slide decks is that the vast majority of founders get this slide wrong. It’s a breath of honey-scented air to see a company get it so right. Honeycomb clarifies the need ($50 million) and precisely what it will do with the money: Runway into 2026, a specific ARR goal and the option to focus on growth or stabilize into a running, profitable business. It also states IPO readiness as a goal (which is a little fuzzy; does that mean it wants to be ready for the IPO and then raise another round to do the IPO, or does the $50 million include all the housekeeping that’s needed to complete an initial public offering?), along with some slightly ambiguous, but clear-enough goals around channels and product. [Slide 17] Look at that! Yess!! Image Credits: Honeycomb I’d use this as your baseline for an “ask” slide. Be clear, be focused. Show what your fundraise will accomplish. (While the company mentions 2026, the runway isn’t the main focus of the slide, which is exactly how it should be.)   OK, for a team slide, this isn’t great: It doesn’t explain why all of these people have a founder/market fit, and it doesn’t show why this team is uniquely positioned to drive Honeycomb to the next level. Specifically, for a round that suggests an IPO might be imminent, I want to know that at least some of the folks in leadership know how to pull that off or at least have support from people who have IPO experience. [Slide 16] Team slide! Image Credits: Honeycomb
And yet, this team is refreshing in how diverse it is, which is sadly quite rare in the startup world, and especially in B2B enterprise SaaS businesses. Having a diverse leadership team doesn’t happen by accident; it’s a concerted effort in hiring and team building. Investors, take notice. [Slide 16] Team slide! Image Credits: Honeycomb Of course, this isn’t an easy “fix.” If you’re putting together a slide deck to raise your next round, and that’s the first time you realize your team slide is filled with Stanford-educated white dudes, well, no amount of creative storytelling can save you. It’s essential to think about the type of company you want to build and put into the world. As a startup founder, you get to make choices about the kind of org you want to create.   For folks who aren’t steeped in development and software, a software engineering observability platform may seem very niche indeed. Blurred-out logos be damned, this slide does a great job at telling the story: [Slide 7] Excellent storytelling means that you don’t even really need to see the logo. The point is made.

Money is on my mind — as well as on the minds of chief product officers, who are increasingly in charge of business outcomes, and even of suggesting M&As. As for HubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan, she’s been giving some thought on how generative AI might translate into revenue. Meanwhile, Arm is following the money by listing in New York and not London. — Anna When YouTube’s longtime CEO Susan Wojcicki stepped down in March, it was chief product officer Neal Mohan who was promoted into her former role. Was that signaling the rise of CPOs? Maybe, because Mohan’s not the only CPO who’s stepped into the role of CEO.

435,Outsourcing giant Capita fears customer data stolen during ransomware attack,['@carlypage_'],"April 20, 2023","Capita, the British outsourcing company that provides critical services for the U.K. government, says hackers may have accessed customer data during a cyberattack last month. The London-based outsourcing giant, whose customers include the NHS, the U.K. military and the Department for Work and Pensions, said in a statement on Thursday that its investigation into the March attack unearthed evidence of “limited data exfiltration” which “might include customer, supplier or colleague data.” Capita hasn’t said how many customers have been affected or what types of data were accessed. Russ Lynch, an agency spokesperson representing Capita, told TechCrunch the company would not comment beyond its statement. However, a Sunday Times report claimed that the Russian-speaking Black Basta ransomware group, which claimed responsibility for the attack, published personal bank account details, passport photos and addresses, along with personal data belonging to teachers applying for jobs at schools. The gang is also believed to be responsible for the recent attack on U.S. satellite television provider Dish. At the time of writing, Capita is not listed on Black Basta’s dark web leak site, which ransomware groups typically use to extort companies into paying a ransom demand for not publishing stolen data. Capita first confirmed that it had suffered an “IT issue” in late March, before later admitting on April 3 that a “cyber incident” was to blame for the disruption, which left staff unable to access its VPN for logging in and Microsoft 365 services. At the same time, Capita claimed it had “no evidence of customer, supplier or colleague data having been compromised.” The cyberattack also disrupted some services Capita provides to clients. Reports claim that local authorities, such as Barnet Council in London, experienced disruption to customer service lines, and companies that use Capita for call center services, such as cellular network O2, were also affected. U.K. government services also experienced disruption, according to Cabinet Office spokesperson Conor Walsh, who told TechCrunch that the incident “primarily affected internal processes with minimal impact on government departments.” “We are aware of the cyber incident which has affected Capita and continue to be in regular contact with the company,” the spokesperson added. Capita holds £6.5 billion ($8 billion) worth of public sector contracts, according to the Sunday Times. In its latest update, Capita said that it has now restored “virtually all client services that were impacted” and said it has reinstated employees’ access to Microsoft 365. Thursday’s statement also confirms that hackers first compromised Capita’s internal systems on March 22, around nine days before Capita “interrupted” the breach on 31 March. “As a result of the interruption, the incident was significantly restricted, potentially affecting around 4% of Capita’s server estate,” the statement reads. “Capita continues to work through its forensic investigations and will inform any customers, suppliers or colleagues that are impacted in a timely manner.” The Information Commissioner’s Office, which enforces the U.K’s data protection laws, confirmed to TechCrunch that “Capita has reported an incident to us and we are assessing the information provided.”  "
436,Amazon Pharmacy now automatically applies coupons on select brand name drugs,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 29, 2023","Amazon Pharmacy announced today that it will now automatically apply manufacturer coupons on brand name drugs to an eligible patient’s order. The company is working with GSK, Kaléo, Novo Nordisk and Dexcom to integrate coupons for their brand-name medications, including Trelegy, AUVI-Q, Wegovy, G6 and G7 continuous glucose monitoring systems and more, directly into the checkout experience on the Amazon Pharmacy website and app. “Now, eligible patients can seamlessly access savings on novel, brand-name therapies for the treatment of diabetes, asthma, emphysema, obesity, and other conditions,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Amazon Pharmacy will automatically apply these coupons at checkout when eligible, meaning patients no longer have the burden of finding and applying coupons, and can focus on managing their care. No clipping, clicking, or downloading.” The company says the move aims to make it easier for patients to take advantage of coupons, noting that a recent study from the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission found that patients only used manufacturer-sponsored coupons 15% of the time they were available to them. There are some restrictions, Amazon Pharmacy notes, as coupons may work in connection with a patient’s insurance, but whether a particular medication is covered under an insurance plan depends on the insurance provider. Additionally, patients who are eligible to receive benefits from any state or federal healthcare program, such as Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Part D, can’t use manufacturer-sponsored coupons. If you’re eligible for a coupon, you’ll see your pricing options with the coupon before you check out. The company outlines that coupon savings are set by manufacturers, who establish which medications have coupons and how they can be used, and that coupons may change or expire at any time. Amazon Pharmacy says if you don’t see a coupon for your medication, you should check back frequently, as it’s working with manufacturers to expand the availability of coupons. When not using a coupon, Amazon Pharmacy provides discounts on generic and non-generic meds, up to 80% and 40% respectively through its Prime prescription savings benefit. The announcement comes a few months after Amazon Pharmacy launched RxPass, a service where Prime users in the U.S. can pay a monthly flat fee of $5 to get as many generic versions of medications as they need. Amazon said that initially the service will cover generic drugs for 80 common ailments — they include, for example, Losartan (the generic for the hypertension drug Cozaar) and Sertraline (the generic for antidepressant Zoloft) and hair-growth pills. It’s worth noting that coupons can’t be applied in addition to RxPass. Amazon has been looking to expand its ambitions in healthcare for many years. The company has bought startups and launched new services and products in aid of that mission. Amazon acquired online pharmacy PillPack in 2018 and closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of primary care tech platform OneMedical last month. Last year, it launched a telehealth service called Amazon Clinic.  "
437,Redfin is laying off more workers as housing downturn persists,['@bayareawriter'],"April 13, 2023","Redfin has laid off 201 employees, the third time the Seattle-based real estate company has reduced its workforce since June. The layoffs, which represents about 4% of its workforce, was first reported by GeekWire. A company spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and told TechCrunch in an email that the roles were primarily in “real estate support” and were “due to the housing downturn and economic uncertainty.” In a statement, Redfin said the affected employees will receive 10 to 15 weeks of severance, depending on tenure, and healthcare coverage for three months. After the job reduction, Redfin now has more than 5,300 employees. “While another layoff is painful, especially for those leaving the company, Redfin must continue to adapt to the current economic climate,” the spokesperson added. “The people leaving Redfin have been wonderful colleagues, and if they wanted to return, we’d welcome them back in a stronger housing market.” With mortgage rates well above 6% this year and last contributing to a housing downturn nationally, real estate technology companies have been hit hard. Last June, Redfin laid off about 470 employees after May demand came in 17% below expectations. At that time, Redfin’s CEO Glenn Kelman said the company didn’t “have enough work for our agents and support staff, and fewer sales leaves us with less money for headquarters projects.” The company also announced last November that it was laying off 13% of its staff, or 862 people, in response to the continued slowing of the housing market. Notably, Redfin also said then it was shuttering RedfinNow, its iBuying division. Kelman wrote in an email to staff at the time: “One problem is that the share gains we could attribute to iBuying have become less certain as we rolled it out more broadly, especially now that our offers are so low…And the second problem is that iBuying is a staggering amount of money and risk for a now-uncertain benefit. We’ve tied up hundreds of millions of dollars in houses that you yourself wouldn’t want to own right now.” The company’s most recent layoff is on a smaller scale, yet indicative of the ongoing pains being felt by many proptech companies and startups. Also last November, Opendoor laid off 550 people, or 18% of its workforce, and Zillow cut 300 jobs in late October."
438,Google Search is adding new ‘Perspectives’ and ‘About this author’ features to help users verify info,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 28, 2023","Google is introducing new ways for users to verify information on Search, the company announced on Tuesday. The search giant is launching new features called “Perspectives” and “About this author,” while also expanding some of its current tools, including “About this result.” The new Perspectives feature is a carousel that will appear below Top Stories and showcase insights from a range of journalists, experts and other relevant voices on the topic you’re searching for. The idea behind the feature is to give users a variety of noteworthy voices on a news topic to broaden their understanding of the subject matter. The carousel will launch soon in English in the U.S. and will be available on desktop and mobile, Google says. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google Google is also launching a new feature called “About this author” that lets users easily learn more about the authors behind the content they are reading. With this new feature, users will be able to find more information about the background of the authors that Google surfaces on Search. The feature is launching on Search results in English globally and on the Perspectives carousel in the U.S. in English. The “About this author” feature is an expansion of Google’s current “About this result” feature, which first rolled out in 2021 in English. The company announced that it’s now launching the “About this result” feature globally in all languages where Search is available in the coming days. Now, all users will see three dots next to most results on Google Search. Tapping those three dots gives users details about where the information is coming from and how Google’s systems determined it would be useful for the query. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google In addition, Google announced that it’s making it easier for users to access its “About this page” feature starting today. “When you click on the three dots next to a result, you can learn more information about the source and topic of a particular page,” the company said in a blog post. “Now we’re making this information even easier to access. Say you’re searching for a rainforest protection organization. Starting today, you can type in the URL of the organization in Google Search and information from About this page will populate at the top of Search. You’ll be able to quickly see how the website describes itself, what others on the web have said about a site and any recent coverage of it. From there, you can evaluate whether you want to visit the website and learn more. This feature is now available globally in English.” Last August, Google rolled out advisories in Search results that are triggered when its systems don’t have high confidence in the overall quality of the results available. The company is now expanding these advisories to languages including German, French, Italian, Spanish and Japanese in the coming months. The idea behind these advisories is to provide context about the whole set of results on the page. It’s worth noting that you can always see the results for your query, even when the advisory is present. Google also gave an update on its $13.2 million grant to the International Fact-Checking Network to launch a new Global Fact Check Fund, which was initially announced last year. The company says the fund will open in the coming days and support more than 130 fact-checking organizations from 65 countries covering over 80 languages.  "
439,Ford Q1 earnings rebound as trucks and fleet sales drive profits,['@rebeccabellan'],"May 2, 2023","Ford reported its first-quarter 2023 earnings Tuesday after the bell, and it marks the first time the legacy automaker will break down earnings by its three new business units: Ford Blue for the iconic gas and hybrid vehicles, Ford Model e for electric vehicles and Ford Pro for commercial products and services.  The automaker reported revenue of $41.5 billion, storming past Wall Street’s expectations of $36 billion, and showing a 20% improvement over the same period last year. Despite Ford’s push to electrify its fleet, that beat was largely driven by commercial, gas-powered and hybrid vehicle sales.  Ford’s net income on a GAAP basis was $1.8 billion, compared to a $2 billion net loss in the 2022 period due to a $7.3 billion write-down on the automaker’s Rivian investment.  On an adjusted earnings basis, Ford earned $3.4 billion, a 45% increase from Q1 2022 and a margin of 8.1%.  Ford’s guidance for the full year remained the same at between $9 billion and $11 billion in adjusted earnings. The company expects to have an adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion in 2023.  By segment, Ford expects 2023 to see $7 billion for Ford Blue, a slight increase from last year; a full-year loss of about $3 billion for Model e; and EBIT of about $6 billion for Pro, which would represent double 2022 earnings.  Ford said operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.8 billion, and that it generated $693 million in adjusted free cash flow. The automaker closed out the quarter with nearly $29 billion in cash on hand.  This is the first quarter that Ford has broken down earnings via its three business units: Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro. Image Credits: Ford Motor Co. This is the first quarter that Ford has broken down earnings via its three business units: Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro. Image Credits: Ford Motor Co. Ford is still taking a loss on its EV business, which it often describes as a “startup.” The unit brought in $700 million in revenue, a 27% decline from last year, partly attributable to production interruptions of two of Ford’s most popular EVs: the F-150 Lightning pickup and the Mustang Mach-E SUV. Ford said production for the Mach-E was interrupted by “industrial changes that will nearly double manufacturing capacity,” which perhaps explains Ford’s most recent price drop on the vehicle. That marks the second time Ford has cut the price on the Mach-E this quarter. The first time was in January and followed similar price cuts from Tesla.  Ford aims to sell EVs at a global run rate of 600,000 units by the end of 2023 and more than 2 million by the end of 2026. The automaker will have to build and ship quickly if it wants to meet that goal. Ford only reported 10,866 EV units sold in Q1 this year.  Despite the losses within Model e, Ford’s other two units were more than enough to push the automaker into growth territory. Ford said that Ford Blue and Ford Pro business segments were both profitable in every region where they operate. The automaker shipped 1.1 million vehicles in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, with the majority of sales coming from Ford’s gas-powered, hybrid and electric trucks, commercial vans and SUVs, according to the company. For the first quarter, Ford Blue brought in revenue of $25.1 billion, up 21% YoY. On an adjusted basis, that’s $2.6 billion. The automaker says it expects to continue to see high growth in this segment. Ford Pro reported $13.2 billion, a 28% increase from last year. In EBIT terms, that $1.4 billion, which is 3x from 2022 reports. That growth was driven both by sales of Ford’s Transit and E-Transit commercial vans, as well as a 64% increase in paid software subscriptions in the first quarter.   The automaker’s credit earnings before taxes were $303 million, which is down from last year due to a lower financing margin, increased credit losses and a decline in leasing income, according to Ford.

440,Hardware gets its turn in the spotlight at Disrupt 2023,['@bheater'],"April 14, 2023","Let’s start with an obvious truth: Hardware is hard. We’ve all heard the cliché — and implicitly understand it to be truth. The good news is such difficulties give us a lot to talk about — and as it happens, for the first time, hardware is getting its own stage at Disrupt 2023. The event, which is hitting San Francisco’s Moscone Center September 19-21, 2023, will shake up the show you know and love. That’s right folks, Disrupt is getting disrupted, and we are its disruptors. We’re adding six industry stages to the show, each focused on a distinct aspect of TechCrunch’s coverage: AI, fintech, hardware, SaaS, security and sustainability. What that means, in practical terms, is that each of these categories is getting a full day of stage programming — panels, firesides, the whole nine. By now you’re probably saying, “Brian, first of all, this is exciting news, and second of all, it’s impossible to cover the entirety of hardware in a single do.” To that I say, first of all, thank you, and second of all, yes that is a very astute and well-reasoned question, but as problems go, it’s a good one to have. As with any broad category, excitement tends to ebb and flow. I would argue that we’re currently barreling toward the latter. It’s been a rough couple of years for hardware broadly — and like everything else in this world, it’s coming out the other end transformed. Trust me, you’re going to want to tune in for this one. Robotics has been top of mind in recent years — in fact, the last three have been among the most exciting in the category’s history. Automation is on the verge of transforming every aspect of our lives, for better and worse. It’s a revolution that’s already well under way, and we’ll be exploring the topic from some novel angles. I’m equally excited to finally give consumer electronics the love they deserve on the Disrupt stage. We’re talking mobile. We’re talking AR/VR/MR. We’re talking space. We’re talking hardware investing, design and manufacturing. Like the rest of you, we’d really love to discuss what’s next for smartphones after several down years. With Apple expected to announce a headset in June, the XR scene is set to be blown wide open. Meanwhile, supply chain constraints and security concerns have caused many to rethink how the world manufacturers. And as for space, it’s big, cold and ever-expanding, apparently. There’s quite literally more of it to talk about with each passing day. Disrupt runs September 19-21 at Disrupt 2023 in SF. Early Bird passes are currently on sale — save $800 when you book by May 14. Seriously, what are you waiting for?"
441,"Amazon closing Halo health division, lays off staff while offering hardware refunds",['@bheater'],"April 26, 2023","Amazon sent out a note to Halo customers today announcing that it is shutting down its Halo Health division, effective July 31. Included in the announcement is news of layoffs, as well as full refunds on hardware purchased over the past 12 months. That includes Amazon Halo View, Halo Band, Halo Rise and a bunch of accessories. That’s not an unprecedented move (Google did something similar when it recently shut down Stadia), but it’s a sign of good will for customers and a tacit acknowledgement that the hardware won’t be worth a hell of a lot when its associated services shut down. The company will also be ending subscription fees and refunding those that were pre-paid. “At Amazon, we think big, experiment, and invest in new ideas like Amazon Halo in our efforts to delight customers,” the company notes in a letter addressed to “Halo Member.” As of the beginning of August, all of the aforementioned products will cease to function. Amazon has also tossed in information for recycling the hardware and saving scan images to a phone’s camera roll. Those impacted by layoffs, on the other hand, don’t appear to have received much warning: We notified impacted employees in the U.S. and Canada today. In other regions, we are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies and possibly result in longer timelines to communicate with impacted employees. For employees who are impacted by this decision, we are providing packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support. At the end of last month, the company announced 9,000 layoffs, adding to 18,000 it made beginning in January. Amazon’s hardware divisions were disproportionately impacted by the first round, with strong focuses on the Alexa/Echo team. The original Halo tracker was greeted with privacy pushback when it was announced in August 2020. A few months later, we spoke to Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar about the concerns. “I really do think there’s got to be rules in place,” she told TechCrunch at the time. “The reason I’m writing HHS is because they should play a larger role in ensuring data privacy when it comes to health, but between the HHS and the Federal Trade Commission, they’ve got to come up with some rules to safeguard private health information. And I think the Amazon Halo is just the ultimate example of it, but there’s a number of other devices that have the same issues. I’m thinking there’s some state regulations going on and things like that, and we just need federal standards.” The line still grew quickly, adding the Halo View, an $80 Fitbit competitor, in late 2021, alongside additional fitness and nutrition programs. Last September, it announced the Halo Rise, a bedside sleep tracker, which went on sale at the end of the year."
442,"Instagram Reels adds a series of creator-focused updates, including a dedicated ‘trends’ section",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 14, 2023","As governments around the world express growing concerns about TikTok, its rival Instagram Reels is getting a series of updates aimed at creators. Meta announced today that it’s adding a dedicated destination for trending audio and hashtags on Reels, expanding gifts on Reels to more countries, enhancing Reels editing tools, adding new metrics and more. With this latest update, creators will be able to see the top trending songs on Reels. They will be able to see how many times the audio has been used and then tap it to use it themselves or save the audio for later. Creators will also be able to see what the top trending topics and hashtags are on Reels. To access the new dedicated destination for trending content, creators have to navigate to their Professional Dashboard and select the “Check today’s Reels Trends” option. From there, they will be taken to a “Reels Trends” page where they can find trending audio and hashtags. Image Credits: Instagram Image Credits: Instagram The company says the new dedicated section aims to help creators learn more about what’s currently popular in order to better inform their own content and ensure they’re staying on top of trends. Instagram is also expanding access to its Gifts monetization feature to creators in more countries in the coming weeks. The feature will be rolling out in Australia, Canada, France, Mexico, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Gifts, which first began testing last year, allows fans to provide a favorite creator with direct monetary support in the form of themed virtual gifts. The gifts are purchased in the Instagram app using the virtual currency Stars and can cost anywhere from just 10 stars to several hundred stars. In addition, the social network is adding a new feature that will show creators which fans sent them gifts. When creators tap on a new heart icon next to their supporters, the user will receive a notification that the creator saw and recognized their gift. Image Credits: Instagram Image Credits: Instagram The new update also makes it easier for creators to edit their Reels on Instagram, as the app has brought together video clips, audio, stickers and text under a unified editing screen. The company says this change makes it easier for creators to align and time parts of their Reels to the right moments in a more visual way. Instagram plans to introduce additional tools that are designed to make editing Reels simpler and easier for creators. Creators are also going to get access to new Reels insights to better understand how their content is preforming. First, Instagram is adding a new “total watch time” metric that captures the total amount of time a reel was played, including any time spent replaying the reel. Second, creators are going to get access to a new “average watch time” metric that captures the average amount of time spent playing a reel, calculated by dividing watch time with the number of total plays. Image Credits: Instagram Image Credits: Instagram “For example if your average watch time is 17 seconds, out of everyone who watched your Reel they watched an average of 17 seconds,” Instagram explained in a blog post. “This will help you better understand where people are being engaged or where you may need to create a stronger hook to have viewers stay longer.” Another new feature gives creators more insight into how their Reels are contributing to their growth, as creators will now receive a notification when someone starts following them directly from their Reel. The new updates come at a time when it would make sense for Meta to try to capitalize on the growing scrutiny around TikTok, which has been banned on government devices by numerous countries around the world and currently faces a potential ban in the U.S. Given these circumstances, it’s not surprising that Instagram is beefing up its rival product and making it more appealing to creators.

443,"Snapchat adds Public Stories, expands revenue share program for creators",['@asilbwrites'],"April 19, 2023","Snapchat is rolling out additional features to help creators get noticed and make a living. Over a year ago, the platform piloted a program that allowed select creators to earn a share of revenue from ads that appear between their Stories posts. Now, creators who have at least 50,000 followers and 25 million monthly Snap views are eligible to enroll in the program, so long as they post at least 10 Stories per month. Ad revenue share has proven one of the most sustainable models for platforms to pay creators, since potential earnings are not limited by the bounds of a creator fund. But it has proven difficult to share ad revenue on short-form video platforms like TikTok; YouTube Shorts has begun trying to make this work, though it has so far proven difficult. Short-form monetization is difficult for an obvious reason: the videos are, of course, short. You can’t embed an ad in the middle of a video — imagine watching a 30-second video with an eight-second ad in the middle — but if you place ads between two videos, who would get the revenue share? The creator whose video appeared directly before or after it? Or, would a creator whose video you watched earlier in the feed deserve a cut too, because their content encouraged you to keep scrolling? Snapchat is side-stepping that problem by offering revenue share on Stories, where mid-roll ads will always appear between the same creators’ videos. This is a clever way to get creators more money while also encouraging them to use the platform more. According to Snapchat, users spent more than double the amount of time year-over-year watching Stories from creators in its pilot revenue share program. According to a Snapchat spokesperson, the platform’s strategy for both Stories and Spotlight, its TikTok competitor, are closely linked. If a creator builds a large following on Spotlight, for example, then of course, they will end up with more Stories viewers. Spotlight now has 350 million monthly users, which still falls behind competitors like TikTok, which eclipsed 1 billion monthly users in 2021, and YouTube Shorts, which reports 1.5 billion logged-in monthly viewers. This program could put more onus on the creator to regularly upload Stories, which disappear after a set amount of time — but that should be made easier with the introduction of Snapchat’s new feature for scheduling Stories. Originally billed as a peer-to-peer, ephemeral messaging app, Snapchat has had to work to make itself a platform where creators will go to upload original content and monetize it. Now, any Snapchat user aged 18 or older can post Stories publicly, helping them to reach a wider audience (if that’s what they so desire). Snapchat is also making it easier for creators to get noticed by integrating their Spotlight content into Snap Map. And with an exclusive integration, users can add a Linktree to their bio on their public profile, allowing followers to easily find them on other platforms. "
444,Turntable LIVE (née tt.fm) raises $7M ahead of public launch,['@bheater'],"March 28, 2023","The Turntable wars were one of the more fascinating stories to emerge in 2021 startup land (though I suspect those involved might dispute the matter). After years away, the beloved but bygone collaborative music streaming service returned for a population that had been stuck inside for a year thanks to a global pandemic. Things got really interesting, however, when a second claimant to the Turntable thrown emerged. There was Turntable.fm, resurrected from the original service by founder Billy Chasen, joined by “Turntable” or “Turntable.org,” which could be found at tt.fm (they were both technically just “Turntable,” but we were using “Turntable.fm” and “tt.fm” in a bid to avoid confusion). That was founded by early Turntable.fm employee Joseph Perla. Whether Perla also deserved the co-founder title is a matter strongly contested by Chasen, however. A few months after Turntable.fm’s relaunch, Chasen announced that the service had raised $7.5 million, led by Andreessen Horowitz, adding to a war chest that had thus far been the product of fundraising through services like Patreon and Venmo. The following month, tt.fm launched as a beta app. That service has since rebranded as Turntable LIVE (all caps is their style, but honestly not the worst idea, all things considered), along with the new URL, turntablelive.com (“Turntable Live,” incidentally, was also the name of a Turntable.fm pivot). This week, the company announced its own seed round just north of $7 million, led by Founders Fund and f7 Ventures. The news also finds a trio of advisors joining up, including Julia Tang (ex-Discord, Instagram), George Howard (Tune Core) and Jonathan Hull (ex-Facebook). A release tied to the news is not pulling any punches: “Created by Joseph Perla, Turntable LIVE has become what Perla laid out more than a decade ago. If the name sounds familiar, you may be remembering an old, legacy Turntable, which crumbled under co-founder disagreements and did not launch with global music licenses or a mobile app. TurntableLive.com is an all-new company that is doing things right.” A completely normal paragraph in a press release about a funding round. Turntable.fm is still very much online, though the company’s been quiet on the social front. A few months back, the team launched “Sup,” a free app that describes its function as follows: “Record and share audio clips that play on your friends phone, even when their screen is locked. Conversation is more than text. Speak, be heard, say it out loud.” It’s clear based on the above names that Turntable LIVE’s approach is leaning far in the social direction. “We’ve created Turntable LIVE with a positive-sum approach in mind,” Perla says in a release. “People need joyful, meaningful social experiences online: music can facilitate that. And music needs more and more compelling ways to reach people and bring them together. Turntable LIVE accomplishes both, as one of the first truly participatory places online for music enjoyment and real-time social interaction.” The service is still in a waitlisted, invite-only beta, with a public version set for launch later this year.

445,"Instagram adds new features to its creator marketplace, expands access to brand agencies",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 11, 2023","Instagram announced today that it’s extending access to parts of its creator marketplace via APIs to make it easier for brands to discover and work with creators on the third-party creator marketing platform they already use. The company is also expanding creator marketplace access to brand agencies. The social network launched its creator marketplace last July as a hub designed to help brands discover and reach out to creators about partnerships and campaigns. The first new API will allow brands to easily reach creators in a priority inbox on the creator marketplace through their preferred creator marketing platform. The second API will allow brands to publish structured project briefs to the creator marketplace straight from a third party. Instagram is testing these APIs with a small cohort of creator marketing partners, including Aspire, Captiv8 and CreatorIQ. The company is also testing dedicated access to the creator marketplace for brand agencies to let them manage creator discovery and collaborations on behalf of their brand clients. Instagram is testing this access with select partners, including Influential, WPromote, Rickhouse Media, Power Digital, Dentsu, OMG and Brkfst. As part of this expansion, agencies will have access to filter creators by gender, age, number of followers and interests. Agencies will also be able to filter for creators based on the demographics of their engaged audience, such as gender, age, interests, country and city. In addition, agencies can send messages directly to creators’ dedicated partnership messages folders and publish discoverable projects that eligible creators can apply to. “Today, we’re announcing new ways to discover and reach Instagram creators by expanding access to brand agencies and testing integrations with top creator marketing platforms,” the company wrote in a blog post. “With these updates, our goal is to complement and help evolve the robust third party ecosystem of agencies and platforms already helping creators and brands form partnerships.” Instagram’s take on its marketplace for creators is similar to TikTok’s Creator Marketplace, which is the video app’s in-house influencer marketing platform. TikTok’s Creator Marketplace allows brands to discover top TikTok personalities for their marketing campaigns, which is similar to Instagram’s goal with its marketplace.  "
446,Asking the right dumb questions,['@bheater'],"March 30, 2023","You’ll have to forgive the truncated newsletter this week. Turns out I brought more back from Chicago than a couple of robot stress balls (the one piece of swag I will gladly accept). I was telling someone ahead of the ProMat trip that I’ve returned to 2019 travel levels this year. One bit I’d forgotten was the frequency and severity of convention colds — “con crud,” as my comics friends used to call it. I’ve been mostly housebound for the last few days, dealing with this special brand of Chicago-style deep-dish viral infection. The past three years have no doubt hobbled my immune system, but after catching COVID-19 three times, it’s frankly refreshing to have a classic, good old-fashioned head cold. Sometimes you want the band you see live to play the hits, you know? I’m rediscovering the transformative properties of honey in a cup of tea. The good news for me is that (and, hopefully, you) is I’ve got a trio of interviews from ProMat that I’ve been wanting to share in Actuator. As I said last week, the trip was really insightful. At one of the after-show events, someone asked me how one gets into tech journalism. It’s something I’ve been asked from time to time, and I always have the same answer. There are two paths in. One is as a technologist; the other is as a journalist. It’s obvious on the face of it. But the point is that people tend to enter the field in one of two distinct ways. Either they love writing or they’re really into tech. I was the former. I moved to New York City to write about music. It’s something I still do, but it’s never fully paid the bills. The good news for me is I sincerely believe it’s easier to learn about technology than it is to learn how to be a good writer. I suspect the world of robotics startups is similarly bifurcated. You enter as either a robotics expert or someone with a deep knowledge of the field that’s being automated. I often think about the time iRobot CEO Colin Angle told me that, in order to become a successful roboticist, he first had to become a vacuum salesman. He and his fellow co-founders got into the world through the robotics side. And then there’s Locus robotics, which began as a logistics company that started building robots out of necessity. Both approaches are valid, and I’m not entirely sure one is better than the other, assuming you’re willing to surround yourself with assertive people who possess deep knowledge in areas where you fall short. I don’t know if I entirely buy the old adage that there’s no such thing as a dumb question, but I do believe that dumb questions are necessary, and you need to get comfortable asking them. You also need to find a group of people you’re comfortable asking. Smart people know the right dumb questions to ask. Covering robotics has been a similar journey for me. I learned as much about supply chain/logistics as the robots that serve them at last week’s event. That’s been an extremely edifying aspect of writing about the space. In robotics, no one really gets to be a pure roboticist anymore. Image Credits: Locus Robotics Image Credits: Locus Robotics I’m gonna kick things off this week with highlights from a trio of ProMat interviews. First up is Locus Robotics CEO, Rick Faulk. The full interview is here. TC: You potentially have the foundation to automate the entire process. RF: We absolutely do that today. It’s not a dream. Lights out? It’s not lights out. Lights out might happen 10 years from now, but the ROI is not there to do it today. It may be there down the road. We’ve got advanced product groups working on some things that are looking at how to get more labor out of the equation. Our strategy is to minimize labor over time. We’re doing integrations with Berkshire Grey and others to minimize labor. To get to a dark building is going to be years away. Have you explored front-of-house — retail or restaurants? We have a lot of calls about restaurants. Our strategy is to focus. There are 135,000 warehouses out there that have to be automated. Less than 5% are automated today. I was in Japan recently, and my meal was filled by a robot. I look around and say, “Hey, we could do that.” But it’s a different market. What is the safety protocol? If a robot and I are walking toward each other on the floor, will it stop first? It will stop or they’ll navigate around. It’s unbelievably smart. If you saw what happened on the back end — it’s dynamically planning paths in real time. Each robot is talking to other robots. This robot will tell this robot over here, “You can’t get through here, so go around.” If there’s an accident, we’ll go around it. They’re all creating a large, cloud-based map together in real time. That’s exactly what it is. When was the company founded? [In] 2014. We actually spun out of a company called Quiet Logistics. It was a 3PL. We were fully automated with Kiva. Amazon bought Kiva in 2012, and said, “We’re going to take the product off the market.” We looked for another robot and couldn’t find one, so we decided to build one. The form factors are similar. Their form factor is basically the bottom. It goes under a shelf and brings the shelf back to the station to do a pick. The great thing about our solution is we can go into a brownfield building. They’re great and they work, but it will also take four times the number of robots to do the same work our robots do. Amazon keeps coming up in my conversations in the space as a motivator for warehouses to adopt technologies to remain competitive. But there’s an even deeper connection here. Amazon is actually our best marketing organization. They’re setting the bar for SLAs (service-level agreements). Every single one of these 3PLs walking around here [has] to do same- or next-day delivery, because that’s what’s being demanded by their clients. Do the systems’ style require in-person deployment? The interesting thing during COVID is we actually deployed a site over FaceTime. Someone walked around the warehouse with a phone? Yeah. It’s not our preferred method. They probably actually did a better job than we did. It was terrific. As far as efficiency, that could make a lot of sense, moving forward. Yeah. It does still require humans to go in, do the installation and training — that sort of thing. I think it will be a while before we get away from that. But it’s not hard to do. We take folks off the street, train them and in a month they know how to deploy. Where are they manufactured? We manufacture them in Boston, believe it or not. We have contract manufacturers manufacturing some components, like the base and the mast. And then we integrate them together in Boston. We do the final assembly and then do all the shipments. As you expand sales globally, are there plans to open additional manufacturing sites? We will eventually. Right now we’re doing some assemblies in Amsterdam. We’re doing all refurbishments for Europe in Amsterdam. […] There’s a big sustainability story, too. Sustainability is really important to big clients like DHL. Ours is an inherently green model. We have over 12,000 robots in the field. You can count the number of robots we’ve scrapped on two hands. Everything gets recycled to the field. A robot will come back after three or four years and we’ll rewrap it. We may have to swap out a camera, a light or something. And then it goes back into service under a RaaS model. What happened in the cases where they had to be scrapped? They got hit by forklifts and they were unrepairable. I mean crushed. Any additional fundraising on the horizon? We’ve raised about $430 million, went through our Series F. Next leg in our financing will be an IPO. Probably. We have the numbers to do it now. The market conditions are not right to do it, for all the reasons you know. Do you have a rough timeline? It will be next year, but the markets have got to recover. We don’t control that. Image Credits: 6 River Systems Image Credits: 6 River Systems Next up, fittingly, is Jerome Dubois, the co-founder of Locus’ chief competitor, 6 River Systems (now a part of Shopify). Full interview here. TC: Why was [the Shopify acquisition] the right move? Had you considered IPO’ing or moving in a different direction? JD: In 2019, when we were raising money, we were doing well. But Shopify presents itself and says, “Hey, we’re interested in investing in the space. We want to build out a logistics network. We need technology like yours to make it happen. We’ve got the right team; you know about the space. Let’s see if this works out.” What we’ve been able to do is leverage a tremendous amount of investment from Shopify to grow the company. We were about 120 employees at 30 sites. We’re at 420 employees now and over 110 sites globally. Amazon buys Kiva and cuts off third-party access to their robots. That must have been a discussion you had with Shopify. Up front. “If that’s what the plan is, we’re not interested.” We had a strong positive trajectory; we had strong investors. Everyone was really bullish on it. That’s not what it’s been. It’s been the opposite. We’ve been run independently from Shopify. We continue to invest and grow the business. From a business perspective, I understand Amazon’s decision to cut off access and give itself a leg up. What’s in it for Shopify if anyone can still deploy your robots? Shopify’s mantra is very different from Amazon. I’m responsible for Shopify’s logistics. Shopify is the brand behind the brand, so they have a relationship with merchants and the customers. They want to own a relationship with the merchant. It’s about building the right tools and making it easier for the merchant to succeed. Supply chain is a huge issue for lots of merchants. To sell the first thing, they have to fulfill the first thing, so Shopify is making it easier for them to print off a shipping label. Now, if you’ve got to do 100 shipping letters a day, you’re not going to do that by yourself. You want us to fulfill it for you, and Shopify built out a fulfillment network using a lot of third parties, and our technology is the backbone of the warehouse. Watching you — Locus or Fetch — you’re more or less maintaining a form factor. Obviously, Amazon is diversifying. For many of these customers, I imagine the ideal robot is something that’s not only mobile and autonomous, but also actually does the picking itself. Is this something you’re exploring? Most of the AMR (autonomous mobile robot) scene has gotten to a point where the hardware is commoditized. The robots are generally pretty reliable. Some are maybe higher quality than others, but what matters the most is the workflows that are being enacted by these robots. The big thing that’s differentiating Locus and us is, we actually come in with predefined workflows that do a specific kind of work. It’s not just a generic robot that comes in and does stuff. So you can integrate it into your workflow very quickly, because it knows you want to do a batch pick and sortation. It knows that you want to do discreet order picking. Those are all workflows that have been predefined and prefilled in the solution. With respect to the solving of the grabbing and picking, I’ve been on the record for a long time saying it’s a really hard problem. I’m not sure picking in e-comm or out of the bin is the right place for that solution. If you think about the infrastructure that’s required to solve going into an aisle and grabbing a pink shirt versus a blue shirt in a dark aisle using robots, it doesn’t work very well, currently. That’s why goods-to-person makes more sense in that environment. If you try to use arms, a Kiva-like solution or a shuttle-type solution, where the inventory is being brought to a station and the lighting is there, then I think arms are going to be effective there. Are these the kinds of problems you invest R&D in? Not the picking side. In the world of total addressable market — the industry as a whole, between Locus, us, Fetch and others — is at maybe 5% penetration. I think there’s plenty of opportunity for us to go and implement a lot of our technology in other places. I also think the logical expansion is around the case and pallet operations. Interoperability is an interesting conversation. No one makes robots for every use case. If you want to get near full autonomous, you’re going to have a lot of different robots. We are not going to be a fit for 100% of the picks in the building. For the 20% that we’re not doing, you still leverage all the goodness of our management consoles, our training and that kind of stuff, and you can extend out with [the mobile fulfillment application]. And it’s not just picking. It’s receiving, it’s put away and whatever else. It’s the first step for us, in terms of proving wall-to-wall capabilities. What does interoperability look like beyond that? We do system interoperability today. We interface with automation systems all the time out in the field. That’s an important part of interoperability. We’re passing important messages on how big a box we need to build and in what sequence it needs to be built. When you’re independent, you’re focused on getting to portability. Does that pressure change when you’re acquired by a Shopify? I think the difference with Shopify is, it allows us to think more long-term in terms of doing the right thing without having the pressure of investors. That was one of the benefits. We are delivering lots of longer-term software bets. Image Credits: Covariant Image Credits: Covariant Lastly, since I’ve chatted with co-founder Pieter Abbeel a number of times over the years, it felt right to have a formal conversation with Covariant CEO Peter Chen. Full interview here. TC: A lot of researchers are taking a lot of different approaches to learning. What’s different about yours? PC: A lot of the founding team was from OpenAI — like three of the four co-founders. If you look at what OpenAI has done in the last three to four years to the language space, it’s basically taking a foundation model approach to language. Before the recent ChatGPT, there were a lot of natural language processing AIs out there. Search, translate, sentiment detection, spam detection — there were loads of natural language AIs out there. The approach before GPT is, for each use case, you train a specific AI to it, using a smaller subset of data. Look at the results now, and GPT basically abolishes the field of translation, and it’s not even trained to translation. The foundation model approach is basically, instead of using small amounts of data that’s specific to one situation or train a model that’s specific to one circumstance, let’s train a large foundation-generalized model on a lot more data, so the AI is more generalized. You’re focused on picking and placing, but are you also laying the foundation for future applications? Definitely. The grasping capability or pick and place capability is definitely the first general capability that we’re giving the robots. But if you look behind the scenes, there’s a lot of 3D understanding or object understanding. There are a lot of cognitive primitives that are generalizable to future robotic applications. That being said, grasping or picking is such a vast space we can work on this for a while. You go after picking and placing first because there’s a clear need for it. There’s clear need, and there’s also a clear lack of technology for it. The interesting thing is, if you came by this show 10 years ago, you would have been able to find picking robots. They just wouldn’t work. The industry has struggled with this for a very long time. People said this couldn’t work without AI, so people tried niche AI and off-the-shelf AI, and they didn’t work. Your systems are feeding into a central database and every pick is informing machines how to pick in the future. Yeah. The funny thing is that almost every item we touch passes through a warehouse at some point. It’s almost a central clearing place of everything in the physical world. When you start by building AI for warehouses, it’s a great foundation for AI that goes out of warehouses. Say you take an apple out of the field and bring it to an agricultural plant — it’s seen an apple before. It’s seen strawberries before. That’s a one-to-one. I pick an apple in a fulfillment center, so I can pick an apple in a field. More abstractly, how can these learnings be applied to other facets of life? If we want to take a step back from Covariant specifically, and think about where the technology trend is going, we’re seeing an interesting convergence of AI, software and mechatronics. Traditionally, these three fields are somewhat separate from each other. Mechatronics is what you’ll find when you come to this show. It’s about repeatable movement. If you talk to the salespeople, they tell you about reliability, how this machine can do the same thing over and over again. The really amazing evolution we have seen from Silicon Valley in the last 15 to 20 years is in software. People have cracked the code on how to build really complex and highly intelligent looking software. All of these apps we’re using [are] really people harnessing the capabilities of software. Now we are at the front seat of AI, with all of the amazing advances. When you ask me what’s beyond warehouses, where I see this really going is the convergence of these three trends to build highly autonomous physical machines in the world. You need the convergence of all of the technologies. You mentioned ChatGPT coming in and blindsiding people making translation software. That’s something that happens in technology. Are you afraid of a GPT coming in and effectively blindsiding the work that Covariant is doing? That’s a good question for a lot of people, but I think we had an unfair advantage in that we started with pretty much the same belief that OpenAI had with building foundational models. General AI is a better approach than building niche AI. That’s what we have been doing for the last five years. I would say that we are in a very good position, and we are very glad OpenAI demonstrated that this philosophy works really well. We’re very excited to do that in the world of robotics. Image Credits: Berkshire Grey Image Credits: Berkshire Grey The big news of the week quietly slipped out the day after ProMat drew to a close. Berkshire Grey, which had a strong presence at the event, announced on Friday a merger agreement that finds SoftBank Group acquiring all outstanding capital stock it didn’t already own. The all-cash deal is valued at around $375 million. The post-SPAC life hasn’t been easy for the company, in spite of a generally booming market for logistics automation. Locus CEO Rick Faulk told me above that the company plans to IPO next year, after the market settles down. The category is still a young one, and there remains an open question around how many big players will be able to support themselves. For example, 6 River Systems and Fetch have both been acquired, by Shopify and Zebra, respectively. “After a thoughtful review of value creation opportunities available to Berkshire Grey, we are pleased to have reached this agreement with SoftBank, which we believe offers significant value to our stockholders,” CEO Tom Wagner said in a release. “SoftBank is a great partner and this merger will strengthen our ability to serve customers with our disruptive AI robotics technology as they seek to become more efficient in their operations and maintain a competitive edge.” Unlike the Kiva deal that set much of this category in motion a decade ago, SoftBank maintains that it’s bullish about offering BG’s product to existing and new customers. Says managing partner, Vikas J. Parekh: As a long-time partner and investor in Berkshire Grey, we have a shared vision for robotics and automation. Berkshire Grey is a pioneer in transformative, AI-enabled robotic technologies that address use cases in retail, eCommerce, grocery, 3PL, and package handling companies. We look forward to partnering with Berkshire Grey to accelerate their growth and deliver ongoing excellence for customers. Image Credits: John Lamb / Getty Images Image Credits: John Lamb / Getty Images A healthy Series A this week from Venti Technologies. The Singapore/U.S. firm, whose name translates to “large Starbucks cup,” raised $28.8 million, led by LG Technology Ventures. The startup is building autonomous systems for warehouses, ports and the like. “If you have a big logistics facility where you run vehicles, the largest cost is human capital: drivers,” co-founder and CEO Heidi Wyle tells TechCrunch. “Our customers are telling us that they expect to save over 50% of their operations costs with self-driving vehicles. Think they will have huge savings.” Image Credits: Neubility / Neubility Image Credits: Neubility / Neubility This week in fun pivots, Neubility is making the shift from adorable last-mile delivery robots to security bots. This isn’t the company’s first pivot, either. Kate notes that it’s now done so five times since its founding. Fifth time’s the charm, right? Neubility currently has 50 robots out in the world, a number it plans to raise significantly, with as many as 400 by year’s end. That will be helped along by the $2.6 million recently tacked onto its existing $26 million Series A. Model-Prime emerged out of stealth this week with a $2.3 million seed round, bringing its total raise to $3.3 million. The funding was led by Eniac Ventures and featured Endeavors and Quiet Capital. The small Pittsburgh-based firm was founded by veterans of the self-driving world, Arun Venkatadri and Jeanine Gritzer, who were seeking a way to create reusable data logs for robotics companies. The startup says its tech, “handles important tasks like pulling the metadata, automated tagging, and making logs searchable. The vision is to make the robotics industry more like web apps, or mobile apps, where it now seems silly to build your own data solution when you could just use Datadog or Snowflake instead.” Image Credits: Saildrone Image Credits: Saildrone Saildrone, meanwhile, is showcasing Voyager, a 33-foot uncrewed water vehicle. The system sports cameras, radar and an acoustic system designed to map a body of water down to 900 feet. The company has been testing the boat out in the world since last February and is set to begin full-scale production at a rate of a boat a week. Image Credits: MIT Image Credits: MIT Finally, some research out of MIT. Robust MADER is a new version of MADER, which the team introduced in 2020 to help drones avoid in-air collisions. “MADER worked great in simulations, but it hadn’t been tested in hardware. So, we built a bunch of drones and started flying them,” says grad student Kota Kondo. “The drones need to talk to each other to share trajectories, but once you start flying, you realize pretty quickly that there are always communication delays that introduce some failures.” The new version adds in a delay before setting out on a new trajectory. That added time will allow it to receive and process information from fellow drones and adjust as needed. Kondo adds, “If you want to fly safer, you have to be careful, so it is reasonable that if you don’t want to collide with an obstacle, it will take you more time to get to your destination. If you collide with something, no matter how fast you go, it doesn’t really matter because you won’t reach your destination.” Fair enough.

447,Volkswagen pumps 1B euros into China electric vehicle center,['@ritacyliao'],"April 19, 2023","Auto Shanghai, which is underway this week, is a yearly opportunity for carmakers and auto suppliers to flex their muscles and show their commitment to China, the world’s largest auto market. At this year’s edition, Volkswagen announced that it will invest around one billion euros ($1.1 billion) in a new China center for the development, innovation and procurement of fully connected electric cars. Marcus Hafkemeyer, chief technology officer of Volkswagen Group China, will head the new firm as CEO. Driven by 2,000 staff, the facility named 100%TechCo plans to merge vehicles and components R&D with procurement. The rationale behind the strategy seems to stem from the German auto giant’s urge to better answer China’s fast-changing consumer needs. “This will leverage synergies in the development process and integrate state-of-the-art local technologies into product development at an early stage,” the company said in its announcement. That is, local suppliers will get to take part in the initial stages of product development so iterations can happen early on. “The aim is to align the Group’s vehicles even more quickly with the wishes of Chinese customers and to achieve shorter time to market,” the company added. The launch of 100%TechCo in 2024 will allow Volkswagen to shorten the development cycle of new products and technologies by around 30%, the company said. The center is already expected to “play a major role” in the development of a future Volkswagen brand model to be launched in 2024. The move came just months after Volkswagen’s other efforts to drive localization for Chinese consumers. In October, the giant announced its joint venture with local auto chip startup Horizon Robotics to develop advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions for the Chinese market. Indeed, Volkswagen is confronting a host of smaller but more agile EV startups in China, its largest market by sales, so adaptation is imperative. Competitors range from internet-native players like Nio, XPeng and Li Auto to new EV subsidiaries of established carmakers, like Geely’s Zeekr, not to mention dominant players BYD and Tesla. 100%TechCo will be based out of Hefei, the capital of China’s eastern Anhui Province where electric vehicle production is booming. Nasdaq-listed EV upstart Nio picked the city as its China headquarters and carries out a big chunk of its manufacturing there. Warren Buffet-backed BYD also has a production base in the city, where one of its bestsellers managed to roll off the assembly line in just a year. Lastly, the newly minted company will also serve the role of integrating the development projects of all of Volkswagen’s Chinese joint ventures in China, which are SAIC Volkswagen, FAW-VW and Volkswagen Anhui. For decades, foreign automakers entered China by setting up joint ventures with local partners until Tesla became the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in the country.     "
448,Always be prompting,['@nmasc_'],"April 1, 2023","Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host Natasha Mascarenhas. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. Reporter’s note: Before we get into this, thank you to the Startups Weekly readers who pointed out that last week’s link to my column was broken. If you want to know about the state of solo GPs — which oh boy, is it rocky — please read my TC+ story here: Are Solo GPs screwed? Ok, now into this week’s newsletter!  “AI whisperer” jobs are roles made for people who are savvy prompt engineers and able to manipulate ChatGPT or other generative AI tools to get what they want from it. As Bloomberg reported earlier this week, these jobs can land up to $335,000 in annual salary. Cha-ching. It’s an impressive price tag for a job role that would’ve blown minds just one year ago. It’s also a reminder that generative AI’s boom will create a whole new set of questions about how we ask questions. By just spending a few minutes playing around on ChatGPT, I learned that you can elicit a diversity of AI-generated answers to questions just by changing a few select words and demanding bullet points versus three sentences. Before we see a whole wave of AI prompt engineering consultancy practices for hire — just kidding, we already are — I figured it would be helpful to aggregate some of the top tips I’m hearing from the community on how to better interact with AI to get it to give you the answers you want. We already know it’s imperfect, it can’t be trusted with every single fact, and it sometimes is left speechless. What can we do with what we’ve got, though? Many techies weighed in on Twitter — you can see the full thread here — but here are the top five tips: 1. Overdescribe. As one person put it, don’t be afraid to be extra when prompting artificial intelligence. There’s a difference between asking for a banana bread recipe and asking for a simple banana bread recipe that incorporates cardamom, takes less than one hour to bake and has a surprise ingredient. Or put differently, don’t just keep it high level, get specific about the tone and complexity you prefer in answers. Over explanation and adjective use was probably the most common tip I received when asking for advice on how to be a better prompter. 2. Ask for help. It’s not always easy to know how specific to get when you’re prompting the AI — so why not ask for help? One entrepreneur told me to ask ChatGPT how to prompt it based on what I want, so ask something like, what information do you need from me to create an itinerary for a San Francisco hiking trip? The AI will tell you what it needs — I wish humans were like this — and as a result, you’ll get a more tailored answer. 3. Give feedback. Let’s say I ask for: “a chatty but informative three-sentence explanation about the impact of generative AI on education, incorporating at least one metaphor.” ChatGPT had a pretty good response, but I didn’t love the response. Tell it that! Feedback is helpful to train the AI on the types of answers you like and takes a split second. Here’s how that process went for me: Natasha: Give me a chatty but informative three-sentence explanation about the impact of generative AI on education, incorporating at least one metaphor. ChatGPT: Generative AI has the potential to transform education by serving as a virtual Sherpa, leading students on personalized learning expeditions. Just as a Sherpa uses experience to guide climbers through treacherous terrain, AI can harness vast data to provide a customized path to knowledge. With the help of generative AI, education can become a more accessible and tailored journey, empowering students to reach new heights. Natasha: I don’t like the virtual sherpa metaphor. Also, can you be more specific on which new heights students can reach? ChatGPT: Generative AI can be thought of as a personal tutor, providing students with a tailor-made curriculum that meets their individual needs and interests. Like a skilled coach, AI can identify students’ strengths and weaknesses, and provide them with targeted guidance to help them excel. With the help of generative AI, students can reach new heights by unlocking their full potential and gaining a deeper understanding of complex topics. 4. Ask for nuance. ChatGPT only answers what it is asked, so why not ask for nuance? A founder said that they ask for pros and cons on every recommendation that they prompt ChatGPT to give. 5. Be a little cringe. Is it self-indulgent to tell AI to speak like me, specifically nudging it to be voicey, charismatic and informative? Maybe, but it helps. One of the biggest hacks I’ve learned is to throw my Twitter handle in when asking for a deep dive on a topic. ChatGPT responds better to “Make an argument for why Cauliflower is the best vegetable in the tone of @nmasc_” than “Make an argument for why Cauliflower is the best vegetable in the tone of Natasha Mascarenhas.” And because I know you’re curious about the former, I’ll leave you with ChatGPT’s argument on cauliflower supremacy: Alright, buckle up folks, because I’m about to make a case for why cauliflower is THE BEST vegetable out there. First of all, let’s talk versatility. This baby can be roasted, grilled, mashed, pureed, riced, and even turned into buffalo wings. Name one other vegetable that can do all that, I’ll wait. And don’t even get me started on the health benefits. Cauliflower is packed with vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, vitamin K, and potassium, not to mention it’s high in fiber and low in calories. Plus, it’s a great source of antioxidants, which help fight off disease and keep your body in tip-top shape. But let’s be real, the best thing about cauliflower is how dang delicious it is. Whether you’re enjoying it as a creamy soup, a spicy stir-fry, or a crispy pizza crust, cauliflower has a flavor and texture that can’t be beat. And let’s not forget about its ability to take on different flavors and spices, making it the ultimate canvas for creative cooking. So, there you have it folks. Cauliflower is the MVP of vegetables, and I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. Those are some starter tips I’m incorporating but I’d still love to know what else I’m missing so please do throw your top tips in this thread. Also, shout out to Fundrise CMO Jon Carden for the headline inspiration! In the rest of this newsletter we’re talking about Cerebral Valley and Substack. As always, you can follow me on Twitter or Instagram to continue the conversation. And if you feel like supporting me extra, subscribe to my personal (and free!) Substack. I attended the Cerebral Valley AI conference on Wednesday, which brought together the top 200 minds in artificial intelligence for a one day deep dive. The event, put on by Newcomer and Volley, was immersive to say the least. I spoke to half a dozen YC founders who are building AI companies, bullish and surprisingly bearish VCs, and, briefly, Stability CEO and founder Emad Mostaque, about keeping it real. And finally: If you’re still looking for more Stability, listen to my podcast interview with Credo AI founder Navrina Singh, who spoke about responsible AI, governance and fear as a not-so-great motivator.  Image Credits: Getty Images Image Credits: Getty Images Blogging and media platform Substack opened up a community fundraising round this week, seeking capital from its writers, readers both accredited and unaccredited. As of Friday morning, over 6,000 investors have pledged around $6.9 million in funding. We spoke about the crowdfunding campaign on our podcast Equity this week, too, which was spicier than I expected. To me, if Substack successfully raises money from its community after disclosing its financials — the equity crowdfunding world will get a much needed reputation and public perception boost. Here’s what to know, via my colleague Alex Wilhelm: Ironically, Substack’s users could be giving professional money managers in the company a bit of a breather. The venture investors that once put a mountain of capital into Substack don’t have to invest more, the incoming dilution is effectively zero and the company gets more total funding to pursue its long-term goals. For Substack, this is a win. We won’t see this sort of conundrum too often. Most startups could not manage this sort of crowdfund because their customers pay them, not the other way around. In contrast, Substack users make part or all of their living from the company, so they are more invested in it sticking around. This makes the Substack crowdfund unique.

449,Alibaba unveils ambition for a copilot as China steps up scrutiny over generative AI,['@ritacyliao'],"April 11, 2023","Over the last few months, the world’s two biggest economies have been racing to showcase their generative AI capabilities. ChatGPT, Midjourney, the new Bing and others have captivated tens of millions of users around the world. In China, entrepreneurs are racing to match their American counterparts. Baidu rolled out a ChatGPT equivalent, for instance. Today, another Chinese tech giant, Alibaba, unveiled its latest effort in generative AI that in a way is reminiscent of Microsoft’s Copilot, which is using AI to make using the giant’s family of apps easier by letting people use natural language to describe what they want to build. On Tuesday, Alibaba announced that its large language model, Tongyi Qianwen, will be integrated across the firm’s businesses to improve user experience. In addition, its customers and developers can create customized AI features by leveraging the model. The Chinese e-commerce and cloud computing behemoth has a wide array of business lines that range from food delivery, video streaming, e-commerce and enterprise communication to flight booking. From the sound of Alibaba’s announcement, all of these services are essentially ready for some AI disruption. The company has already put natural language to use in two apps. In a pre-recorded demo, Alibaba showed how its Slack-like workplace chat app DingTalk uses Tongyi Qianwen to summarize chat history, come up with corporate culture slogans, write meeting minutes and convert handwritten charts to mini apps. The LLM is also being baked into Tmall Genie, said the announcement, the smart voice assistant of Alibaba’s premium online retailer. “We are at a technological watershed moment driven by generative AI and cloud computing, and businesses across all sectors have started to embrace intelligence transformation to stay ahead of the game,” said Daniel Zhang, chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group and CEO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, in a statement. “As a leading global cloud computing service provider, Alibaba Cloud is committed to making computing and AI services more accessible and inclusive for enterprises and developers, enabling them to uncover more insights, explore new business models for growth, and create more cutting-edge products and services for society.” Users have yet to see or try Alibaba’s full suite of products powered by AI, so it’s still way too early to say how robust these upgraded services are. But there are already some limitations on how AI can be used across internet services. On the same day that Alibaba announced its ambitious AI moves, China’s top internet watchdog released draft measures to regulate how tech companies serve users with generative AI models. The proposed rules came as no surprise, mostly in line with previous regulations introduced to regulate other aspects of AI. For instance, the new draft measures require that AI service providers must register their algorithms with the internet authority, verify users’ identities and keep a record of their data input, such as AI prompts.

450,"Ramp reports 4x revenue growth, says it still has ‘vast majority’ of equity funding",['@bayareawriter'],"March 29, 2023","2022 was a tumultuous year for many fintech startups. But for Ramp, it was a year of opportunity. The company shared today that it saw its revenue grow by 4x last year, buoyed by what co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman describes as a desire on the part of companies of all sizes and stages seeking to save money by managing their spend better. “During one of the most rapid raises of interest rates we’ve really seen in U.S. history and with the cost of capital gone up, companies realized they need to make the most of every dollar,” he said. Last July, Ramp revealed that it had crossed $100 million in annualized revenue before its third birthday in March of that year. Glyman this week declined to share updated revenue figures, noting only that business continued to grow — led by its fastest-growing segment of bill pay. Notably, the executive also claimed that the startup — which has secured $670 million in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception — still has “the vast majority of [equity] funds” it has “ever received” still on its balance sheet. It has intentionally remained lean, currently operating with 464 staffers and has not conducted any layoffs. Ramp is not yet profitable as it is focused on growth while aiming to be efficient, Glyman said. “We’ve grown our contribution to profit and our bottom line even faster,” he told TechCrunch. Over time, Ramp said it has helped its customers cut expenses by over $400 million. It counts over 15,000 businesses as customers with “well into hundreds of thousands of users” and is onboarding about 1,000 users per day. Like some of its competitors in the space such as Brex and Navan (formerly TripActions), Ramp says it is working with increasingly larger companies. So while the majority of its customers are mid-market businesses, it is attracting more late-stage private companies, such as Attentive, as well as publicly traded ones like EventBrite. Other customers include Betterment, Waymo, Deel, Webflow, Barry’s Bootcamp, Caraway, TaskRabbit and Quora. Glyman says Ramp supports a “wide variety” of businesses including tequila brand 818, airlines, farms, manufacturers and even steel mills. He also believes its boost in business was due in part to actions of its competitors. For example, Brex infamously announced last summer it would stop working with small businesses and nonfunded startups. “We think that our customers evaluate companies and their character, and what they’ve done, not just at a moment in time, but what they’ve done over the years,” Glyman said. “I think when other players in the market don’t serve companies or change their behavior rapidly, companies will often ask their peers who they recommend.” Ramp, he added, is not seeking to raise more capital currently. Meanwhile, other companies in the space continue to expand their offerings. Brex announced last week that it expanded into travel. Besides seeking to snag market share from incumbents such as Concur, Brex is also taking on Navan (formerly called TripActions) — which actually started its business focused on travel expense management before broadening its offering — and Ramp, which itself expanded into travel last year with a tool that gives employees the ability to book with third parties. In February, Navan claimed to be the first travel company to integrate OpenAI and ChatGPT APIs across its infrastructure and product set. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.

451,Twitter’s new dog icon is sending dogecoin — sigh — to the moon,['@alex'],"April 3, 2023","Today Twitter users are noticing that an image of a dog has been added to a place of prominence. You can see it for yourself on Twitter.com, where you will be greeted with a pup: Image Credits: Twitter Image Credits: Twitter The particular dog image — a Shiba Inu — corresponds with the logo of the dogecoin blockchain and cryptocurrency. Normally the swapping out or addition of an icon inside an app is not news. In this case cryptocurrency investors sent the value of dogecoin sharply higher in the wake of the inclusion of its logo in Twitter’s app. In short, the social media service’s update has led to a pump. Here’s what dogecoin’s price has done in the wake of the dog’s inclusion: Image Credits: Yahoo! Finance Image Credits: Yahoo! Finance Look I don’t want to live on this planet any longer either. The greater context for this latest bit of Twitter-silliness is that the owner of the social media service, Elon Musk, is in court over dogecoin, looking to dismiss a massive suit relating to the cryptocurrency. In that suit, Musk’s lawyers recently called dogecoin a “legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion,” arguing that Musk’s tweets thereof were just that. We suppose that this app update is part of Musk’s general view on the litigation.   As of the time of writing, the value of dogecoin has shot to around $12.4 billion. Perhaps the crypto winter is behind us."
452,"Apple to open first India retail stores next week, signaling growth ambitions in emerging market",['@refsrc'],"April 11, 2023","Two decades after entering India, Apple is gearing up to launch its first set of retail stores in the populous South Asian nation, signaling the tech giant’s growing interest in the market. Apple said on Tuesday it plans to open Apple BKC in Mumbai on April 18 and Apple Saket in Delhi on April 20. The iPhone-maker’s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple’s expansion efforts. Despite being the world’s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple’s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation’s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations “mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.” In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings. The company, which launched its Indian online store in 2020, had initially planned to open its first retail location in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a delay. Apple is also working to turn India into a key global hardware manufacturing hub, thanks in part to the incentives New Delhi is offering to manufacturers to expand their presence in the country. The company’s contract manufacturing partners, Foxconn and Wistron, have increased local assembly of iPhones and other Apple devices in recent quarters. According to a report by JP Morgan analysts last year, Apple is expected to expand its manufacturing capacity in India to produce 25% of all iPhones by 2025."
453,Hear how Cambrian BioPharma is reinventing drug (and drug company) development,['@mjburnsy'],"May 3, 2023","I’m thrilled to announce this TechCrunch Live event. The startup Cambrian BioPharma is developing a life-changing technology while pioneering a radical approach to a pharmaceutical company. Don’t miss this TechCrunch Live taking place on May 3 at 12 p.m. PDT. Register here. It’s free to watch and participate. Cambrian BioPharma bills itself as a new pharmaceutical company with a revolutionary approach to developing and managing drug development. James Peyer, PhD, co-founded the company in 2019, and it has since raised over $180 million to accelerate the development of medicine designed to target the causes of age-related diseases. But that’s not the most interesting part. Peyer’s executive team has managed to attract top talent by giving them an oversized amount of equity compared to traditional pharmaceutical companies. Instead of developing pharmaceuticals inside Cambrian BioPharma, the company essentially spins out the solution with the top scientists sitting in the C-suite alongside seasoned Cambrian BioPharma executives who will help operate the new company. Maryanna Saenko of Future Ventures is also speaking at this TechCrunch Live event. She sits on Cambrian BioPharma’s board of directors and invested in the company’s Series A, B, and C rounds. Together, the two are going to break down Cambrian BioPharma’s unique business model and explain why this process works so well. Maryanna is also a co-founder and partner at Future Ventures, where she sits on the boards of several deep tech medical startups, including Deep Genomics, Earthshot Labs, and Gameto. She brings with her a wealth of knowledge and experience from her time at Future Ventures, and previously Khosla Ventures, Threshold Ventures, and DFJ. It’s a joy to have her and James Peyer speak on the innovative work of Cambrian BioPharma. Register here for the TechCrunch Live event."
454,Here’s why Uber investors are cheering its Q1 earnings results,['@alex'],"May 2, 2023","It is tempting to assume that the ride-hailing model is going the way of moribund businesses, especially in the wake of Lyft’s well-publicized layoffs and executive turnover. But Uber’s earnings results for the first quarter partially dispel those concerns. Uber not only beat analysts’ expectations across the board, it also demonstrated that its financial footing is growing firmer: Its multipart business model is going well now that its food delivery business, which supported its ride-hailing efforts during the pandemic, is handing the growth baton back to the company’s original enterprise. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. In the first quarter, Uber’s revenue of $8.82 billion topped analysts’ expectations by about $100 million, which is significant. The company’s GAAP loss was also narrower than expected ($0.08 in per-share loss compared to the average analyst estimate of a $0.09 per share loss), while its adjusted profits came in better than the street reckoned ($761 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to the estimate of $678.6 million). Shares of the company spiked following the announcement and are up 8.9% at $35.68. Against the backdrop of Lyft’s struggles and tepid growth at major tech companies, this morning, we’re digging into Uber’s results, looking at the good, the less-good and the curious. Our goal is to understand the company’s recent performance, and we’ll close with a note on Uber’s profitability-growth trade-off as it exists today, and what that can tell us about investor sentiment today. That last bit is key for startups looking to raise more capital, so read closely. To work! Uber saw its gross bookings rise 19% to $31.4 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier (bookings rose 22% after adjusting for currency fluctuations, but we’re sticking to flat figures for the rest of this post). The company’s revenue rose 29%, bolstered by a change in how Uber handles its U.K.-based accounts. Uber’s gross bookings are derived from its two major businesses, ride-hailing and food delivery (more data here):"
455,"eBay appoints new head of emerging markets, covering regions like Southeast Asia and India",['@catherineshu'],"May 2, 2023","eBay announced today that it has appointed Vidmay Naini as its general manager for global emerging markets, a role that covers the company’s growth in Southeast Asia, India, Eastern Europe, Israel, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Before his new position, Naini led eBay’s Southeast Asia and India businesses. Naini has been with eBay for 18 years; his previous projects include eBay’s strategic investment in Flipkart. In a statement, Naini said, “the digital economy is exponentially growing in these markets, with small and medium-sized businesses propelling its growth. Global e-commerce platforms such as eBay can revolutionize export opportunities and expand the reach these businesses can achieve.” In its announcement about Naini’s appointment, eBay highlighted its 2022 Southeast Asia Small Online Business Trade Report, which found that 99% of all small businesses on eBay currently export items to an average of 25 different international markets on an annual basis. In Southeast Asia in particular, 68% of “eBay-enabled small businesses” in six countries — Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore — export to 10 or more international markets. Naini told Tech Wire Asia last July that he expects to see strong growth in Southeast Asia and that eBay’s business in the region was just beginning to take hold. “We’ve seen significant growth in our business, especially with the SMBs selling from this region to the world. The truth is, we are just scratching the surface because we see eBay as a very nascent business here still, and we expect it to grow multifold.”  "
456,The layoffs will continue until (investor) morale improves,"['Ron Miller', 'Alex Wilhelm']","March 26, 2023","Since the start of 2023, more than 150,000 people have been laid off at tech companies, large and small. That’s a staggering number of people who have been put out of work. When you think about how Meta, Amazon and Salesforce have handled these layoffs, the situation becomes even more grim. Salesforce announced in January that it was laying off 10% of its approximately 80,000 employee workforce. Since then, it has been letting people go in dribs and drabs. Amazon also announced in January that it was laying off 18,000 employees, then announced another 9,000 this week. Meta laid off 11,000 in November and let another 10,000 people go in a second round this week. In addition, the company shut down another 5,000 open recs. This, some would say, cruel, rolling approach to layoffs leaves employees anxious and uncertain about their own positions, while grieving about the loss of valued colleagues who have been let go. Investors, on the other hand, seem to like layoffs as a way to move companies toward greater operating efficiency. CEOs typically are less concerned about the well being of their employees as they are in keeping investors happy. An argument could be made, of course, that these companies overhired during the recent tech boom, and now it’s time to right size to better fit a changing market. That argument would carry more weight if the companies in question weren’t profitable. However, large American tech companies are very often both profitable and incredibly wealthy, even if their market cap has fallen from record highs. While there is some truth to the idea that companies grew too quickly in recent years and need to reset, layoffs feel like the worst kind of short-term thinking: sacrificing employees to please investors. Are companies at least getting what they want from investors out of this devil’s bargain? If companies are looking to impress investors with their cost-cutting measures, we can rate how effective their layoffs are by how investors have reacted to them."
457,‘There’s too much opportunity’ in Cerebral Valley,['@nmasc_'],"April 3, 2023","Evan Buhler moved to San Francisco’s Hayes Valley three months ago to build an AI company that would combine the buzzy technology and his experience as a startup attorney. At the time, he didn’t realize he had moved to the heart of a movement. Hayes Valley, which has been nicknamed “Cerebral Valley” by tech enthusiasts and builders, is exploding with happy hours, networking events and hackathons focused on one thing: artificial intelligence. Some attribute the spotlight to a rise in hacker homes in the area. Others think San Francisco just needed some good press, but perhaps most importantly to eager entrepreneurs amid a downturn, it has the attention of top-tier investors. “It almost feels like destiny. I think it’s going to become the economic and spiritual center of San Francisco,” Buhler said of his new stomping grounds. “I saw a competitor raise $5 million from OpenAI; the frothy environment is inspiring to a lot of entrepreneurs” who wouldn’t have made the jump otherwise, he described. Buhler, looking to spread word of his new startup, was one of the 200 founders, investors, engineers and entrepreneurs at the one-day Cerebral Valley Summit, hosted by tech journalist Eric Newcomer and AI gaming startup Volley. Early-stage startups and storied entrepreneurs, buzzing with excitement, discussed the opportunity of the current moment on stage and at the literal watercooler."
458,Bluesky’s best shot at success is to embrace shitposting,['@asilbwrites'],"April 27, 2023","I have joined so many social media websites since October 27, 2022, the fateful day in which Elon Musk tanked his net worth and volunteered for the worst job in the world. There’s Mastodon, T2, Spoutible, Hive, Post, Cohost and so many more, but no Twitter alternative has felt as promising as Bluesky. That is, in part, because of how much shitposting is going on there. Bluesky hatched from Twitter’s nest in 2019, when Twitter founder Jack Dorsey announced that the platform would fund a small, independent team to develop a decentralized standard for social media. Like Mastodon, Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within an open source network. Before we could have ever considered that Musk would buy Twitter, the “bluesky initiative” was central to the company’s long game — now the independent team has launched its invite-only beta, still operating with funding from Dorsey. (Yes, we know how sad it is that we are so excited for a Twitter alternative that is literally funded by a Twitter founder who publicly declared that Musk is the “singular solution” he trusts with his old company.) As one astute Bluesky user, Pavel Samsonov, wrote: “bluesky (serious people making silly little posts) is the spiritual opposite of linkedin (deeply silly people trying to write serious thoughtposts).” Samsonov even included a handy visual aid. Image Credits: Pavel Samsonov on Bluesky Image Credits: Pavel Samsonov on Bluesky It’s an apt description. I’m seeing the same journalists and tech folk that I follow on Twitter — I even found someone I know from Weird Facebook — but people aren’t talking about earning reports, layoffs and stocks. In this particular moment, Bluesky is a collection of people who remain addicted to the adrenaline of Twitteresque microblogging but are exhausted by the constant onslaught of asinine discourse and Musky shenanigans. Enter: shitposting. In what feels like a few days, a silly and chaotic culture has developed on Bluesky. There is no name for posts, like how Twitter has tweets, or how Mastodon used to have toots until they retired that branding because they’re cowards. So, people are calling Bluesky posts “skeets,” a portmanteau of “tweet” and “sky” that I am pretty sure is slang for ejaculate fluid but I will not fact check that because I am holding on to my one last shred of sanity. Rich Burroughs, a developer advocate, thinks that this culture was formed from the top down. Some Bluesky developers are very active on the platform that they’re building in real time, responding to users’ questions, complaints and feature suggestions, all while still acting like a real person. “Some of the staff seem to be accomplished shitposters themselves, which I think is a great energy that has been lacking with other Twitter alternatives,” Burroughs told TechCrunch. “People keep building these super serious feeling platforms to compete with Twitter, but what’s happening on Bluesky feels a lot like the early Twitter days, and why it became successful.” After publicly feuding with Musk, who gave him a blue check against his will, legendary shitposter Dril joined Bluesky today. Bryan Newbold, an employee of Bluesky, posted, “if first @dril.bsky.social poast sucks we are going to burn the whole thing down and try again.” Image Credits: @emily.bsky.team on Bluesky Image Credits: @emily.bsky.team on Bluesky Dril fandom seems to be all the rage among the Bluesky team. Another developer, Emily Liu, posted that Newbold gifted her with a book of Dril’s best tweets upon joining the team (also pictured is a book called “There Is No Antimemetics Division,” which sounds like something I should read ASAP). This fact seemed a bit too perfect for arguing my thesis that Bluesky will succeed by deliberately cultivating shitposting, so I double-checked with Newbold to make sure this was legit. He replied: “It Is The Public Stated Policy Of Bluesky PBLLC That All New Employees Shall Receive The Finest @dril.bsky.social Tweets In Printed Form.” Make of that what you will. When dismayed Twitter users scrambled to find a new platform to call home, some flocked to Tumblr, another social network that has largely failed to monetize because its user base is deliberately resistant to behaving predictably. When Tumblr rolled out a creator subscription product, users vehemently opposed it. As per data from November, more Tumblr users have purchased dashboard crabs (pixelated crabs that dance around your dashboard and can be gifted to friends) than actual creator subscriptions. And as a very targeted gag, Tumblr also offered users the chance to buy not one, but two blue checks for $8. In spirit, Bluesky feels a bit like Tumblr, except that I have not yet seen anyone drop a link to Archive of Our Own and/or a Ray-Ban sale. But unlike Tumblr, these aren’t high school kids shitposting about “Supernatural”; they’re adults with jobs who are looking for a social media experience as far removed from LinkedIn as possible. Sure, this is all a generalization, and perhaps there is some very serious corner of Bluesky that I have not yet encountered. But Bluesky seems to have taken what people enjoyed about Mastodon and Twitter and mushed it together, without as many of the bad parts. Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, Bluesky is intuitive, while Mastodon comes off as inaccessible: Choosing what instance to join feels like an impossible task, and longtime users are very defensive about their established tooting posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. As tech reporter Paris Martineau wrote on Bluesky, “genuinely, i think mastodon failed because it discouraged shitposting.” Bluesky still has a lot to overcome. The platform has not yet had to contend with the large-scale content moderation concerns that come with decentralization, and the app remains a walled garden (please don’t DM me for invite codes; I do not have any). But at least for this sliver of internet history, Bluesky is feeling good. And Dril is here.    "
459,OpenAI geoblocks ChatGPT in Italy,['@riptari'],"April 1, 2023","No, it’s not an April Fools’ joke: OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy. The move follows an order by the local data protection authority Friday that it must stop processing Italians’ data for the ChatGPT service. In a statement that appears online to users with an Italian IP address who try to access ChatGPT, OpenAI writes that it “regrets” to inform users that it has disabled access to users in Italy — at the “request” of the data protection authority — which it known as the Garante. We of course defer to the Italian government and have ceased offering ChatGPT in Italy (though we think we are following all privacy laws). Italy is one of my favorite countries and I look forward to visiting again soon! — Sam Altman (@sama) March 31, 2023  It also says it will issue refunds to all users in Italy who bought the ChatGPT Plus subscription service last month — and notes, too, that it is “temporarily pausing” subscription renewals there in order that users won’t be charged while the service is suspended. OpenAI appears to be applying a simple geoblock at this point — which means that using a VPN to switch to a non-Italian IP address offers a simple workaround for the block. Although if a ChatGPT account was originally registered in Italy, it may no longer be accessible and users wanting to circumvent the block may have to create a new account using a non-Italian IP address. OpenAI’s statement to users trying to access ChatGPT from an Italian IP address. Image Credits: Screenshot/Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch OpenAI’s statement to users trying to access ChatGPT from an Italian IP address. Image Credits: Screenshot/Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch On Friday the Garante announced it has opened an investigation into ChatGPT over suspected breaches of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — saying it’s concerned OpenAI has unlawfully processed Italians’ data. OpenAI does not appear to have informed anyone whose online data it found and used to train the technology, such as by scraping information from internet forums. Nor has it been entirely open about the data it’s processing — certainly not for the latest iteration of its model, GPT-4. And while training data it used may have been public (in the sense of being posted online), the GDPR still contains transparency principles — suggesting both users and people whose data it scraped should have been informed. In its statement yesterday the Garante also pointed to the lack of any system to prevent minors from accessing the tech, raising a child safety flag — noting that there’s no age verification feature to prevent inappropriate access, for example. Additionally, the regulator has raised concerns over the accuracy of the information the chatbot provides. ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots are known to sometimes produce erroneous information about named individuals — a flaw AI makers refer to as “hallucinating.” This looks problematic in the EU since the GDPR provides individuals with a suite of rights over their information — including a right to rectification of erroneous information. And, currently, it’s not clear OpenAI has a system in place where users can ask the chatbot to stop lying about them. The San Francisco–based company has still not responded to our request for comment on the Garante’s investigation. But in its public statement to geoblocked users in Italy, it claims: “We are committed to protecting people’s privacy and we believe we offer ChatGPT in compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws.” “We will engage with the Garante with the goal of restoring your access as soon as possible,” it also writes, adding: “Many of you have told us that you find ChatGPT helpful for everyday tasks, and we look forward to making it available again soon.” Despite striking an upbeat note toward the end of the statement, it’s not clear how OpenAI can address the compliance issues raised by the Garante — given the wide scope of GDPR concerns it’s laid out as it kicks off a deeper investigation. The pan-EU regulation calls for data protection by design and default — meaning privacy-centric processes and principles are supposed to be embedded into a system that processes people’s data from the start (aka, the opposite approach to grabbing data and asking forgiveness later). Penalties for confirmed breaches of the GDPR, meanwhile, can scale up to 4% of a data processor’s annual global turnover (or €20 million, whichever is greater). Additionally, since OpenAI has no main establishment in the EU, any of the bloc’s data protection authorities are empowered to regulate ChatGPT — which means all other EU member countries’ authorities could choose to step in and investigate — and issue fines for any breaches they find (in relatively short order, as each would be acting only in their own patch). So it’s facing the highest level of GDPR exposure, unprepared to play the forum shopping game other tech giants have used to delay privacy enforcement in Europe. Last but not least – this is a wake up call that #GDPR, #Article8 Charter, data protection law in general & particularly in the EU IS APPLICABLE TO AI SYSTEMS today, right now, and it has important guardrails in place, if they are understood & applied. 18/🧵 — Dr. Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna (@gabrielazanfir) March 31, 2023   "
460,HV Capital closes €710M fund amidst the wider European and global funding downturn,['@mikebutcher'],"May 4, 2023","If you’ve heard of Flixbus, SumUp, StudiVZ, Seatwave, Cafe Press, Zalando, Wooga, HelloFresh, Depop, Delivery Hero and Agreena, then you’ve heard of companies invested in by HV Capital. The German early- and growth-stage VC has been a stalwart of the European tech startup ecosystem since at least the early 2000s, funding largely German-born companies which have usually scaled both in the large DACH market and often spreading internationally. It’s now closed the its ninth “Fund IX” at €710 million, its largest ever fund to date, and backed by institutional investors from Europe and the United States. Prior to the news above, the largest fund to close in Q1 this year was HighTech Gründerfonds’ (also a German friend) with nearly €500 million for Fund IV. In addition, McWin Capital Partners’ closed a €300 million Food Ecosystem Fund. The HV Capital fund will be split into two vehicles, “Fund IX Venture” and “Fund IX Growth” to target companies from seed to Series D and beyond. Four investments have already been made from this new, such as in Berlin-based SPREAD, Berlin-based Polyteia, Munich-based ecoplanet and Copenhagen-based Agreena. The fund will also build on HV Capital’s stated commitment to advancing ESG themes in VC. It’s committed to Article 8 of the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Article 8 products are those “which promote environmental or social characteristics and which integrate sustainability into the investment process in a binding manner.” Thus, HV Capital says it will target 33% female representation in C-suite-level positions across the portfolio. Plus, 30% of the funds allocated will go to companies aligned with the Climate Action & Environmental Sustainability criteria of the European Investment Fund (EIF), by the end of the fund’s lifecycle. In a statement, Rainer Märkle, general partner at HV Capital said: “Fund IX will allow us to partner with outstanding entrepreneurs, who from every industry and market across the continent, are making incredible differences to the way we live our lives.” HV has also put its money where its mouth his, hiring female investors like Zuzanna Czapinska, recently promoted to investment manager. The VC firm has invested in around 225 internet and technology companies, supporting startups with ticket sizes ranging from €500,000 to €60 million, has offices in Munich and Berlin, and €2.7 billion assets under management. This latest news shows the continental European VC is managing to keep its head above water in more turbulent economic times. The Q1 2023 European Venture Report from PitchBook found the European venture deal value fell 32.1% quarter-over-quarter, while the number of deals dropped 19.2% in Q1 2023. There has been a sharp fall in startup funding, late-stage venture has an increased share of deal value compared to early stage and there’s a lot more M&A and consolidation with the IPO markets effectively closed. However, Europe’s funding downturn simply matches the global funding downturn of 53% year over year, according to Crunchbase."
461,LeapXpert raises $22M to monitor employee chats for compliance,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 29, 2023","The pandemic brought with it a spike in work-from-home and hybrid work, which increased peoples’ dependence on personal devices — driving businesses to try and rein in their use. It’s been a particular challenge for the financial services industry, which has comparatively strict governance and compliance requirements. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined Wall Street banks, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, $1.8 billion over failures in monitoring how staff used their personal phones to talk about work. On the hunt for a solution to the chat compliance problem, three entrepreneurs — Dima Gutzeit, Avi Pardo and Rina Charles — decided to create their own, LeapXpert. LeapXpert allows employees to message customers or colleagues through popular apps, including WhatsApp, WeChat, iMessage, Telegram and Signal, while monitoring and archiving their business-related chats. “My co-founders and I were concerned that if businesses didn’t evolve fast enough to adopt modern messaging apps and transform this growing shadow communication into approved and reliable business communication mediums, there would be major negative implications,” Gutzeit told TechCrunch in an email interview. “And so, LeapXpert was founded with a mission to help companies seize the opportunity to transform business communication.” Staffers might find the idea of an app that records their conversations disconcerting — and rightly so. When asked about privacy, Gutzeit was open about the fact that LeapXpert can maintain “a complete record” of all conversations between a company’s employees and third parties — but added that LeapXpert itself doesn’t have access to the data. “Just like in cases of regulatory audits, when regulators turn directly to the financial institute, law enforcement agencies may request data directly from our customers,” Gutzeit clarified. “It’s then up to our customers to decide if and how much data to pull from their archiving system and hand over to the authorities. We aren’t a party to any such transaction.” It’s a trend, to be fair. Even before the pandemic, conversation monitoring in the workplace was becoming more common than it used to be. According to a 2019 survey by GetApp, only 10% of managers considered recording worker chats to be an invasion of privacy, while 47% admitted to monitoring conversations on a daily or weekly basis. Unsurprisingly, workers aren’t too happy about this. In a 2022 study, Harvard Business Review found that monitoring staffers actually makes them more likely to break rules. And anecdotally, monitoring tends to lead to mission creep. Goldman Sachs once used a monitoring system to automatically flag 180 different phrases in employee communications for scrutiny by its compliance officers, including seemingly innocuous exchanges like “answer your phone,” “don’t worry I’ll take care of it” and “I don’t understand.” But given the high stakes in the financial industry, with the SEC making it abundantly clear that it sees personal, unmonitored texts from bank employees as an impediment to investigations, employers are less likely to be dissuaded. See Deutsche Bank, which last June forced bankers to install an app called Movius that tracks communications on their phones. “For technical decision makers, maintaining control over messaging channels used for business communication is crucial,” Gutzeit said. “To date, our unique value has been in building the pipes for better communication.” While that’s up for debate, LeapXpert touts its worker-monitoring, “mobile-first” dashboard through which employees can sign in to and access chat channels such as SMS, iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, Signal, Line and certain VoIP apps. On the employer side, companies can set rules and requirements for the types and level of materials that can be sent internally or externally, including specific keywords and phrases, and see the real-time status of all messages sent. LeapXpert promises to avoid capturing private and personal messages by siloing communications, enabling employees to have an independent messaging profile for personal use. TechCrunch wasn’t able to test this, though, so we can’t say how well it works in practice. We also can’t say whether it’s possible for an employer to circumvent this silo — a valid fear for surveillance-wary employees. LeapXpert’s platform acts as a gateway to popular chat channels such as WhatsApp, SMS and iMessage, running monitoring and archiving tools on top of chat sessions. Image Credits: LeapXpert LeapXpert’s platform acts as a gateway to popular chat channels such as WhatsApp, SMS and iMessage, running monitoring and archiving tools on top of chat sessions. Image Credits: LeapXpert Purely from a competitive standpoint, LeapXpert faces an uphill battle. Other platforms like it exist, including Symphony, TeleMessage and VoxSmart. But Gutzeit argues that, rightly or wrongly, LeapXpert is more holistic in its data capture than most. “We have added dozens of integrations with other tech solution providers. It has made the platform more compressive and enabled new use cases for new markets,” he said. In any case, LeapXpert hasn’t had trouble attracting customers — or investors, for that matter. Gutzeit says that the company counts “dozens” of financial institutions among its client base as well as “dozens” of enterprises in other vertical markets that collectively have tens of thousands of users on the platform. “Customers tell us that our product is a ‘must have’ not ‘nice to have,'” Gutzeit said. “The slowdown in the economy and in tech has not affected our business.” To that end, LeapXpert this week closed a $22 million Series A funding round led by Rockefeller Asset Management with participation from Uncorrelated Ventures, the Partnership Fund for New York City and other undisclosed existing investors. It brings the company’s total raised to $36 million, which Gutzeit says is being put toward growing LeapXpert’s 150-person workforce, expanding into new markets and investing in product development. With the cash infusion, LeapXpert also plans to launch a software-as-a-service version of its platform aimed at small- and medium-sized business customers. Currently, LeapXpert comes in only on-premises and self-managed cloud flavors. “The latest round provides us an additional layer of stability and comfort during these times and enables us to maintain and even accelerate our growth trajectory.”"
462,Jakarta-based cloud kitchen startup Legit Group gets Series A to take over the rest of Indonesia,['@catherineshu'],"April 11, 2023","Legit Group, a cloud kitchen brand operator based in Jakarta, has its eyes on the rest of Indonesia after raising a $13.7 million Series A. The round was led by MDI Ventures, the venture capital arm of PT Telcom Indonesia Tbk, the largest telecom conglomerate in Indonesia. It included participation from Sinar Mas Digital Ventures (SMDV), returning investor East Ventures and Winter Capital. This funding follows a $3 million seed round raised by Legit Group in 2021, from East Ventures and AC Ventures. Since then, Legit Group says its sales have grown three times. Founded in 2021, Legit Group currently operates four of its own cloud brands: Pastaria, Sei’Tan, Sek Fan and Ryujin. It covers 30 points in Jabodetabek, the larger Jakarta metropolitan area. Its goal with the new funding is to expand into new areas with large delivery markets, as 80% of its outlets are currently in Jakarta.

Image Credits: Legit Group Before founding Legit Group, chairman Bran Hendrata spent 15 years in the F&B industry. During that time, he built F&B company Ismaya Group into one of the largest in Indonesia. Hendrata told TechCrunch he became interested in cloud kitchens after witnessing the shift toward online food delivery during the pandemic. He believed the changes in habits would continue after the pandemic, as Indonesia’s growing middle class demanded convenience, like having restaurant-quality food delivered to their homes. Other cloud kitchen startups in Indonesia include Yummy and Hangry. Legit Group is currently working on an operating system that it says will give it an advantage over other cloud brand operators, but Hendrata said the company isn’t ready to comment on the tech yet since it’s one of the biggest projects they’re working on with the new funding. The startup plans to expand further in Jabodetabek and will also enter second-tier cities like Surabaya and Malang this year. It also plans to launch new brands that will have different peak hours than its existing ones to more efficiently utilize its kitchens. In a statement about the investment, MDI Ventures CEO Donald Wihardja said, “Legit Group founder’s experience, Bram who has been successful and profitable in the F&B business world for 15 years, as well as their ability to develop innovative, effective product and marketing strategies, makes MDI Ventures increasingly confident that our support as a major investor will strengthen their position in the F&B industry and accelerate their business growth.

463,Tencent backs Singapore’s Horizon Quantum Computing in $18M round,['@ritacyliao'],"April 3, 2023","Quantum computers have the potential to carry out highly complicated calculations in minutes that would have taken classical computers thousands of years to work out. But much of the industry is still in its infancy, partly because of a lack of domain experts and software tools that match the progress of quantum hardware. Now, companies are working to simplify the process of developing quantum software applications so programmers don’t actually need to understand the underlying quantum mechanics. One of the early-stage startups making such an effort is Singapore-based Horizon Quantum Computing, whose tools can automatically construct quantum algorithms based on programs written in classical programming languages. The company recently picked up $18.1 million in a Series A round from Tencent along with other investors, boosting its equity financing to around $21.3 million. Other investors in the Series A round included Sequoia Capital India, SGInnovate, Pappas Capital and Expeditions Fund. The money will be used to fund product development and its expansion in Europe, where the company is planning to open an office in Dublin, Ireland. The startup is also scheduled to launch the early access program of its developer tools later this year. While Singapore is more widely known as a financial hub, it has also been one of the most proactive governments in supporting quantum technologies. The Center for Quantum Technologies, where Horizon Quantum Computing’s founder and CEO Joe Fitzsimons used to be a professor, was set up under the city-state’s Research Centres of Excellence program to advance research in the cutting-edge field. “When I made the jump from academia, Singapore already had the right talent [for quantum computing] and there was access to capital,” said Fitzsimons, who earned a PhD from University of Oxford. Being in a politically neutral country like Singapore is increasingly important in a world where businesses become caught in the tech war between the U.S. and China and lose access to supply chains. Launching from a neutral home base is now seen as a prerequisite for many tech firms, including quantum computer builders, who rely on components sourced from around the world. Tencent’s investment in Horizon Quantum Computing is purely financial, so it won’t entail any transfer of sensitive data, the founder noted. The startup took Tencent’s investment because the giant is an “expert” in the area, he said. Indeed, the social networking and gaming giant showed a keen interest in the field when it opened its quantum research lab in 2018. Ling Ge, Tencent’s chief representative in Europe and the person who oversaw the deal with Horizon Quantum Computing, has known Fitzsimons since her years in Oxford, where she studied quantum computing. “At Tencent, we take a long-term perspective on quantum. In our own quantum lab, we are focused on fundamental research, first-principles simulations and quantum algorithms, and how these might serve enterprise customers,” said Ge at an industry event last year. “In terms of investments, we take a science-driven approach. One of the challenges in investing in quantum is what we call the ‘black box’ paradox. The challenge of evaluating early-stage deep tech companies in areas like quantum, nuclear fusion or biotech is difficult because the core technology is in its early proof-of-concept phase. It is hard to evaluate and understand at what stage of maturity it really is. “Therefore, we take appropriate steps to mitigate the risks of this black box paradox depending on the investment stage. This is primarily achieved through our deep technical expertise, which allows us to really understand what is being developed and its maturity,” she said. The story was updated on April 3, 2023 to clarify the founder’s view on export controls.         "
464,Indian edtech Unacademy slashes another 12% of jobs,['@jagmeets13'],"March 30, 2023","Unacademy has laid off 12% of its workforce, or more than 350 roles, in its latest round of layoffs — just over four months after cutting about 350 roles in November. Unacademy co-founder and CEO Gaurav Munjal announced the new layoff decision in a Slack post to employees. “We have taken every step in the right decision to make our core business profitable, yet it’s not enough. We have to go further, we have to go deeper,” he wrote in the message reviewed by TechCrunch. “Today’s reality is a contrast from two years ago where we saw unprecedented growth because of accelerated adoption of online learning. Today, the global economy is enduring a recession, funding is scarce and running a profitable business is key. We have to adapt to these changes, build and operate in a much leaner manner so we can truly create value for our users and shareholders,” he said. The latest move comes just days after the Bengaluru-based startup hived off programming learning platform CodeChef, which it acquired in 2020.   Unacademy, valued at $3.4 billion, cut 1,000 full-time and contractual employees in April last year. The startup in June also announced a pay cut and shut down of “certain businesses” to survive the funding crunch. Edtech startups in India are struggling to attract investments and facing challenges due to the market downturn. Unacademy competitor and India’s most valuable startup Byju’s also cut thousands of jobs last year and recently discussed shutting down coding platform WhiteHat Jr. “To those of our employees impacted by this decision, this is never the experience I hoped you would have had at Unacademy. I take complete responsibility for the way things have turned out,” Munjal said in his message. Unacademy, which counts Sequoia Capital India, SoftBank and Tiger Global among its key investors, will provide a severance pay equivalent of notice period and an additional one month’s pay to impacted employees. The startup has also promised to give medical insurance coverage for an additional six months until September 30, and dedicated placement as well as career support, and accelerate the vesting period of their stock by one year. Exact details on which roles are affected by the move were not disclosed."
465,How the feds caught a notorious credit card fraudster,['@carlypage_'],"May 4, 2023","The U.S. government announced on Wednesday that it had dismantled “Try2Check,” a credit card checking operation that allowed cybercriminals involved with the bulk purchase and sale of stolen credit card numbers to see which cards were valid and active. Department of Justice prosecutors confirmed the indictment of Russian citizen Denis Gennadievich Kulkov, who is suspected of creating Try2Check in 2005. Kulkov is said to have made at least $18 million in bitcoin from the service, which not only victimized credit card holders and issuers, but also a prominent U.S. payment processing firm whose systems were exploited to conduct the card checks. Try2Check took advantage of the unnamed company’s “preauthorization” service, whereby a business — such as a hotel — requests that the payment processing firm preauthorizes a charge on a customer’s card to confirm that it is valid and has the necessary credit available. Try2Check impersonated a merchant seeking preauthorization in order to extract information about credit card validity. In November 2018, the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service used an undercover online persona to load bitcoin into a Try2Check account. An agent then logged into that account and ran 20 newly created credit card numbers through Try2Check’s card checking system. These transactions appeared in the systems of the U.S. payment processing firm as if they were submitted by U.S. merchants for preauthorization, and contained unique identifying numbers corresponding to real merchants. Not only did these transactions reveal the inner workings of Try2Check, but also the vast scale of the operation: The same IP addresses used to submit the credit card numbers for preauthorization had collectively submitted over 16 million credit card numbers for preauthorization over nine months between April and December 2018. According to prosecutors, Try2Check processed at minimum tens of millions of card numbers every year. While this undercover operation revealed the scope of Try2Check’s activity, uncovering the person behind it all was far more arduous. The FBI and U.S. Secret Service confirmed they had been investigating the service since 2013. A photo of Denis Gennadievich Kulkov, the main suspect in the Try2Check credit card scheme, as pictured on a U.S. government “wanted” photo. Image Credits: State Department. A photo of Denis Gennadievich Kulkov, the main suspect in the Try2Check credit card scheme, as pictured on a U.S. government “wanted” photo. Image Credits: State Department. The decade-long probe largely centered around tracking Kulkov’s various online personas. For example, reviews of the Internet Archive revealed that the early versions of the Try2Check website, then known as “just-buy.it”, contained the name “Kreenjo” in its logo. At the same time, feds discovered that “Kreenjo” was also the name of a user who posted on internet forums frequented by cybercriminals. In 2006, for example, a user named Kreenjo offered credit card checking services on an online cybercrime forum. The signature of the message contained the URL “check.just-buy.it,” which was a web address where Try2Check could be accessed at that time. U.S. investigators continued to track the online presence of Kreenjo, who also went by the aliases of “Nordex” and “Nordexin”; the former had identified himself as “Denis from Samara,” a city in southwestern Russia, in messages sent to forum users, while the Nordexin moniker was discovered in records obtained from a unnamed crypto exchange. These records showed that the registered user for that account supplied his passport, revealing the name “Denis Kulkov,” an address in Samara and an email address, referred to as “Nordexin Platform-1,” which ultimately unmasked Kulkov as the man behind the now-notorious Try2Check service. Evidence linking Kulkov to Try2Check continued to grow: Travel documents obtained from Marriott International that linked Kulkov’s identity to the passport used to open his cryptocurrency account and images matching his passport photo were found on a publicly accessible Instagram profile belonging to “Denis Kulkov, Ferrari owner” and a Foursquare site that had “liked” various businesses in Samara, Russia. As a result of this mounting evidence, a judge in May 2019 ordered the search of the Nordexin Platform-1 account. The account contained images of webpages from Try2Check that were not publicly available, including screenshots of the site’s “administrator panel,” and a page that listed the bitcoin balance associated with each Try2Check user. It also contained multiple emails between Denis Kulkov and others, including his wife, who also provided travel documents to the Marriott hotel. One of these emails contained a picture of Kulkov holding up his passport. In another, he attempted to convert his cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency, asking “What is the maximum amount which will not cause compliance suspicion?” Ultimately, it wasn’t Kulkov’s attempts to convert his millions in crypto that was his undoing, but rather his failure to cover his sprawling online tracks. The U.S. Department of State announced a $10 million reward offer for information leading to Kulkov’s arrest or conviction. If convicted, Kulkov faces 20 years’ imprisonment.  "
466,Track the right metrics to improve your developers’ work experience,['@alexcircei'],"April 13, 2023","While the past few years saw a big drive towards caring for employees, the last months have seen the pendulum swing in the other direction. The tech industry has been harrowed by layoffs and economic uncertainty — and that’s directly impacting existing employees’ morale and well-being, which in turn affects their productivity. Digital health tools, better mental health treatment and mental health days are great steps, but they do not directly address some of the root causes of software engineer dissatisfaction at work. To counter this productivity-sapping trend, companies need to be thinking more about developer experience (DX). DX looks significantly different from general employee well-being. Developer experience is more about how software developers feel about the work they do on a daily basis, and that’s directly influenced by the tools and processes they use. That means looking at your team’s experience of the work day itself, the resources they use, and the efficiency of their workflow. The benefit of optimizing those elements is not only happier developers — it translates directly into better business results. Engineering leaders can do this by more effectively monitoring engineer satisfaction and performance to spot factors that are harming your engineering team’s experience. They should embrace new, holistic metrics and learn how to respond to them. Here are the steps any tech company can take to better understand and improve their developers’ experience. A staggering 3 in 4 software developers globally have experienced burnout in their lifetimes, and engineering leaders everywhere should be asking themselves why. One of the problems is that we’re essentially making engineers’ lives more difficult than they need to be. We have tools to better optimize the workflows and resources software developers use on a daily basis — which would improve their day-to-day experience and help reduce the risk of burnout. However, we may be missing opportunities to make those improvements because we’re not tracking the right metrics on how our engineering teams work, or talking to them enough about their experience. Another problem is that we haven’t been enabling software developers to engage in more fulfilling tasks. The 2019 State of DevOps report found that software developers often spend just 30 to 40% of their time actually creating features, while most of their time is consumed by delays and admin work. Fixing these time-consuming, low-reward tasks can lead to greater career development and job satisfaction. Tools that give engineering leaders visibility into this data are widely available and can drastically improve a developer’s experience. If we harness them, each business can start identifying their own unique root causes for developer dissatisfaction at work. There are two things engineering leaders need to look at: the best metrics to really gain insights into DX and how to use that information to improve how software developers feel on the job. A growing number of companies are turning to DORA metrics to measure software development performance. These are critical indicators, which essentially measure agility and quality. However, they don’t give the full picture. Indeed, the same team that created DORA’s four key metrics went one step further, and created the more holistic SPACE metrics system. These encompass all of DORA’s metrics, while also looking at the human or emotional aspect of software engineers’ work (or “Satisfaction and well-being”). Here’s a breakdown of SPACE:"
467,"Headphone startup Nura gets acqui-hired by Denon parent, Masimo",['@bheater'],"April 20, 2023","Every so often, a new startup crosses your radar and reminds you how exciting hardware can be. It’s a relative rarity in consumer electronics, a category dominated by corporations like Samsung, Apple and Sony, which are (perhaps understandably) somewhat risk averse. Melbourne-based Nura was one such company. I distinctly remember the startup paying a visit to TechCrunch’s New York offices not long after I started here. The early prototype was a thing to behold — effectively a mess of wires and circuits in a large box. But the point was clear. Turned out wireless audio could be much better than what we’ve slowly grown accustom to over the years. At the base of the firm’s various headphones was customizable audio profiles, created by mapping the unique architecture of the wearer’s ear. I beckoned a colleague over for a second opinion (and to make sure I wasn’t hearing things). They confirmed that there was, indeed, something next level — frequencies and elements in music that you miss altogether on a different pair.   The startup was recently acquired by Southern California medical device firm Masimo Corporation for an undisclosed sum. Nura will join fellow consumer audio brands under that umbrella, including Bowers and Wilkins, Polk Audio and Denon, which entered its portfolio when it acquired Sound United in April of last year. The news was announced quietly a couple of weeks back in a press release titled, “Nura Joins Forces With Denon.” What easily might have been mistaken as a partnership deal was actually effectively an acquiring of Nura talent and technology. “It was important to put the consumer first,” Masimo COO Blair Tripodi tells TechCrunch, when asked about the new reveal. “We chose to highlight the longstanding heritage and sound acoustics of Denon, so that fans would be as excited as we are for the future of Masimo AAT and the possibilities it unlocks.” Tripodi did, however, confirm the acqui-hire, stating, “Nura was a technology tuck-in and acquisition-hire of engineering talent to support the Masimo Adaptive Acoustic Technology (AAT) platform.” The company is cagey on specifics here, but the short version is that Nura’s tech is being folded up into Denon’s competing offering. Employees previously involved in research and development Nura will be folded into the same team at Denon. The company didn’t explicitly confirm layoffs, instead offering the line, “Our goal is to retain critical talent and integrate their employees into our business with the goal of advancing our AAT platform.” It’s simple enough to read between the lines on that one, unfortunately. As for the former startup’s executives, Tripodi says, Nura’s existing leadership team will stay intact and will report into a number of Masimo leaders, depending on department function. Masimo says that the plans don’t currently effect Nura’s offices, nor is it asking the employees it’s retained to relocate. As for timeline, Nura co-founder and CEO Luke Campbell adds, “Nura’s integration into Masimo AAT is well underway with the goal of bringing personalized audio to more customers around the world.” In past conversations, Nura has prided itself in remaining fiercely independent. I’ve previously discussed the topics of acquisition or technology licensing, but the startup has long been committed to building its own hardware products. The portfolio grew quickly, as the startup explored various monetization models, including a fairly early exploration of the hardware as a service model, which has been viewed as an increasingly viable strategy for the consumer electronics market. “It was always our vision to share the award-winning technology with as many people as possible,” Campbells says, when asked about the change in direction. “Masimo and the Masimo AAT platform presented us a chance to improve our existing technology framework, and I couldn’t be more excited about the future. Masimo’s industry-leading signal processing capabilities paired with Denon’s commitment to quality sound, will unlock opportunities that can take the personalized audio space to new heights.” No one ever said hardware was easy. And while Nura continued to offer a differentiator, the earbud market has grown more crowded with each passing year. It can also be a punishing category for hardware makers who don’t also produce their own handsets. For many — or even most consumers — there’s a benefit in the interoperability of those devices. Often times those who opt for a different option are looking for a less expensive product, and prices has subsequently dropped considerably. Nura’s products, meanwhile, largely sat between $150-200. Add into that supply chain issues and seemingly endless economic headwinds, and it’s easy to see how the path forward suddenly gets a lot cloudier than it might have seemed three or four years back. Nura declined to comment on what circumstances ultimately led it to sell to Masimo. Co-founder and CEO Kyle Slater left Nura in 2017 and most recently served as the CPO of Melbourne-based medical technology company, Seer. Third co-founder Dragan Petrović left in December. In the earlier release, the company outlines what the future looks like for existing Nura users, writing, in part: All Nura products will continue to be supported throughout the warranty period. Existing Nura customers can feel confident that their Nura device will be supported through this transition, including customer support and warranty support. The Nura app will continue to function as it does today, so you will still be able to create personalized hearing profiles and use all app functions. Masimo says it will sell through the remainder of its Nura inventory, at which point it appears the Nura brand will be fully sunset. The startup’s underlying technology will be a Denon exclusive, moving forward, with no plans to license to third parties. Details on the first Denon product to support the combined adaptive sound technologies will be announced at some point this summer."
468,Twitter quietly removes policy against misgendering trans people,['@asilbwrites'],"April 18, 2023","Twitter updated its content moderation guidelines regarding hateful content, removing a policy that prohibited the targeted deadnaming or misgendering of transgender people. Enacted in 2018, the policy explicitly stated that it violated Twitter’s rules to repeatedly and purposefully call a transgender person by the wrong name or pronouns. Spotted by GLAAD, this unannounced change to the hateful content guidelines occurred in early April. The rest of the webpage explaining these policies appears unchanged. Before the change, per the Internet Archive, the “Slurs and Tropes” subsection of the policy included the following: “This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.” That line has since been removed. Twitter’s guidelines still say that users may not attack others on the basis of their gender, gender identity or sexuality. Yet this removal of a clause that explicitly protects trans people is part of a continued trend in which Twitter has become more hostile toward LGBTQ+ individuals. Since Musk’s takeover, the platform has disbanded its Trust and Safety council and reinstated the accounts of previously banned users like author Jordan Peterson and conservative satire outlet The Babylon Bee, both of which were sanctioned for the targeted harassment of transgender people. A report from GLAAD and Media Matters also showed that since Elon Musk’s takeover, usage of the anti-LGBTQ “groomer” slur has increased.  “This decision to roll back LGBTQ safety pulls Twitter even more out of step with TikTok, Pinterest, and Meta, which all maintain similar policies to protect their transgender users at a time when anti-transgender rhetoric online is leading to real world discrimination and violence,” said GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis in a statement.

469,Remote working means this startup can use brains in emerging markets to disrupt management consultants,['@mikebutcher'],"April 18, 2023","The global management consulting industry is worth billions of dollars, but to this day it’s been tough to disrupt with technology. Traditional consulting firms provide high-quality services, but they cost a lot and have rigid terms. And while there are plenty of portals offering low-quality freelance consulting services, these are generally unsupervised and would never work for corporates and the public sector. Plus, countries like India are famous for offering back-office and research work at scale. A YC company, Apollo Group, is also in this space, roughly speaking. Intellia is an up and running startup that has raised $1.5 million so far from Fatima Gobi Ventures and angels. How it works is by engaging remote talent from emerging markets, which can now (because of the acceptance of remote working, post-pandemic) participate in much higher value roles in finance, strategy and public policy. Launching out of Dubai in 2020, Intellia looks for strategy and finance consultants in emerging markets where wages are cheap, throws in some AI-powered vetting, and comes up with a project delivery platform for finance, strategy and public policy. It claims its on-demand, remote analysts (from countries such as Colombia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates) can be deployed within 24 hours, and can save companies 80% on recruiting and advisory budgets. It’s now set to launch in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Lagos, Nigeria next month. Intellia founder and CEO Saad Raja told me over email: “From a business model perspective, we are closest to what Turing is for software engineering and Superside is for design — in addition to all remote talent vetted and trained from emerging markets. We are addressing the gap in the market between traditional consulting firms and freelance portals.” Examples of what Intellia analysts are doing right now include advising multinational companies with product launches, or even new market entry projects for Michelin-star restaurants in Europe. “We also have a wider purpose: Intellia’s mission is to build frontier markets as knowledge economies with a diverse workforce (half of our analysts are female) — aligned with ESG principles and social responsibility,” says Raja."

471,Don’t go it alone: Incubators and accelerators help build lifelong relationships,['@ron_miller'],"April 26, 2023","Launching a company is hard work. Even experienced founders don’t know what they don’t know, and having some structure and a group of like-minded people can help you refine your idea and get the product off the ground. One way to build that camaraderie is through incubators and accelerator programs. Speaking at TechCrunch Early Stage Boston last week, Matt Segneri, the executive director at the Harvard Innovation Labs, highlighted the importance of finding peers and mentors to go with you on your startup journey, and incubators and accelerators can help build those crucial relationships. It’s easy to spin your wheels as a startup founder without help, and connecting with a startup-focused group is a good way to find people who are in a similar position, Segneri said. His organization has been around for about 10 years, serving 3,300 venture founders from 150 different countries, so he knows from whence he speaks. However you do it, whether an incubator or an accelerator, you are generally very early with your idea, and that’s OK. That’s the purpose of joining one of these programs. “Essentially, these [programs] are just ways to support you at a really early stage of your startup,” Segneri said. “We’re working with folks who are pre-idea and pre-venture, but I would say for most of these, save the university flavors of incubators, these are really efforts where you [may] already have a venture, but you may not have product-market fit, you may not have any revenue, you may still be figuring out your business model.” Regardless of whether you participate in an accelerator, an incubator or a competition, Segneri says the greatest value you get from these programs is the ability to build relationships with people you will carry with you throughout your career. And the idea is to build these connections and friendships instead of trying to go it alone. “So this is fundamentally saying, how do you transform entrepreneurship from the solo sport that it is for many folks in the room to a team one,” he said."
472,VW and Redwood want to turn your old laptops into EV batteries,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 4, 2023","Battery materials and recycling startup Redwood Materials is expanding a partnership with Volkswagen of America in its bid to collect more end-of-life batteries from consumer electronics and strip out the valuable materials so they can be used to make batteries for electric vehicles. Redwood has said its technology can recover more than 95% of the critical minerals from batteries (like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper) and then manufacture the metals into battery components that are supplied to U.S. battery manufacturers for new electric vehicles and energy storage products. Co-founder and CEO JB Straubel, who was formerly the co-founder and CTO at Tesla, has long argued that creating a closed-loop system will reduce battery costs and the need to mine and ship raw materials. Volkswagen of America and sibling brand Audi contracted with Redwood last year to recover and recycle end-of-life EV battery packs from its thousand-dealership network in the United States. Audi then expanded its partnership with Redwood to launch a consumer-focused recycling program. Now Volkswagen of America has agreed to set up bins at certain dealerships to collect consumer electronics. The batteries and devices, including cell phones, cordless power tools, electric toothbrushes, wireless headphones and other lithium-ion-powered devices that are collected in the bins, will be sent to Redwood’s Nevada facility to be repurposed as EV batteries. The consumer recycling program officially launches at 14 dealerships April 22, including locations in New Jersey and Wisconsin. Volkswagen will also set up a bin during the New York International Auto Show, which will be held from April 5 to April 16. Additional dealerships will be added throughout the year. Redwood has largely been a B2B enterprise since its founding. The company has locked in deals with companies like Panasonic to recycle and process the scrap to recycle scrap from battery cell production. In early 2021, Redwood quietly opened a recycling program to everyday consumers and all of the old electronics sitting in their junk drawers. Redwood posted a “recycle with us” tab on its website, along with an address, where consumers can send their e-waste, and a “contact us” button. The program has collected tens of thousands of pounds of electronics from consumers, according to Redwood."
473,The US is losing crypto talent as blockchain devs seek safer havens,['@jacqmelinek'],"April 5, 2023"," It’s usually third-world countries that frequently say they’re experiencing a “brain drain” — the bleeding of talent to other countries or parts of the world. But it seems now the United States is the one seeing talent fleeing to other parts of the world, at least as far as blockchain developers are concerned. The number of blockchain developers in the U.S. has declined every year since 2017, according to a recent report by Electric Capital. While it’s arguably a bad signal for American innovation, it also points to a globally growing remote crypto ecosystem and workforce in a post-COVID world. According to the report, the U.S.’ share of blockchain developers has fallen 2% per year in the last five years, dropping to 29% last year from 40% in 2017. “The question is does it matter and why,” Paul Stavropoulos, CEO of credit-focused platform bridging the Web 2.0 and web3 worlds Archie Finance, told TechCrunch+. “The first and most important thing is overall growth of the ecosystem. That has been constant, which is fantastic, but it’s not good that the U.S. is losing market share.” Compared to other regions in the world, America’s drop is “a marginal difference,” Maria Shen, partner at Electric Capital, said. Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) maintained a consistent share of around 29% during the five years from 2017 to 2022. Right now, a lot of information being communicated to the crypto industry is through enforcement action. That scares away innovation.
Austin King, CEO and co-founder, Recursive “There’s a counterpoint where it’s not a bad thing that the U.S. is losing market share of developers, but maybe what’s important is the overall number of developers,” Stavropoulos said. “COVID has been a huge help in building remote teams; it’s no longer taboo to build a team with folks all around the world.” Archie Finance’s engineering team is Slovenian, but it’s still a U.S.-based team, Stavropoulos noted. “It perhaps is not as important that the engineering talent stays in the U.S. as it is that the actual company’s innovation starts in the U.S. I think the scary thing is when innovation doesn’t touch the U.S. at all because of accredited investor rules or people don’t want to be jailed.” Overall, a significant increase in the number of developers is the most important thing, Stavropoulos said. In the last seven years, the crypto industry gained over 22,000 monthly active developers, bringing the total number to 23,343 as of December, up 5% from a year earlier, the report said. About 52% of all monthly active developers began contributing in 2022, marking a big chunk of the people building today. Image Credits: Electric Capital 2022 Crypto Developer Report Image Credits: Electric Capital 2022 Crypto Developer Report While the U.S. and Europe are each home to 29% of all crypto developers, regions like Asia, India, Latin America and Africa saw more crypto devs taking up the torch in 2022. “There’s amazing untapped potential around the globe,” Stavropoulos said. “It’s also cheaper to hire extremely qualified engineers abroad.”"
474,"Amazon debuts free, ad-supported streaming channels just for Fire TV",['@sarahintampa'],"May 1, 2023","Amazon is doubling down on free, ad-supported content with today’s introduction of Fire TV Channels, its new, free and ad-supported (FAST) video experience coming to Fire TV devices this week. Though Fire TV had previously offered FAST content, Fire TV Channels will now be continuously updated throughout the day and integrated into several areas across the Fire TV interface, including on Home Screen rows, within Fire TV’s “Free” tab, and in category-specific pages devoted to certain genres. In addition, Fire TV is gaining a set of new FAST channels from NHL, Xbox, and TMZ, as well as a new Travel category featuring content from Tastemade Travel, “Rick Steves’ Europe,” “Travel Hacks,” and soon, Condé Nast Traveler. Later, Fire TV Channels will also include content from the PGA. The company explained this Fire TV update was informed by customer behavior and the increasing demand for free streaming content. “We’ve offered some of this [FAST] content for a while for customers — we’ve helped them discover it throughout the [user interface] by having rows of content for example throughout ‘Home’ or other pages,” explains Charlotte Maines, director of Advertising, Monetization, Marketing and Engagement for Fire TV. “We’ve seen that they’ve been engaging with it when we surface it in a topical way…And what we’ve seen in the past six months alone is that the monthly hours streamed of this content have grown by 300%. So we know it’s working for our customers,” she added. The growth can be attributed to several factors, the exec said. For one, customers have hit a sort of saturation point with streaming video-on-demand offerings and don’t have interest in adding more subscriptions to their monthly bills, nor do they want to try to keep up with any more services. By comparison, FAST channels are easy to use because users don’t have to create an account, sign in, or jump through any other hoops to start watching. With the update, the Fire TV interface will now pull all the new and existing FAST content together in an updated experience that provides access to a variety of categories like news, sports, food and cooking, music videos, trailers, gaming videos, comedy, and more, Maines notes. The news category includes access to both national news coverage as well as over 330 local news channels, including as of later this week, new FAST channels from NBC and Telemundo. These category pages can be accessed with just a click from Fire TV’s “Free” tab, and Amazon says more categories are “coming soon.” The update was announced as part of Amazon’s broader NewFronts presentation, which also included updates to its free streaming service Freevee — which offers FAST channels of its own. But Freevee is accessible across platforms, including on mobile devices and other non-Amazon media players and TVs, while Fire TV Channels are exclusive to Fire TV. The company’s pitch to advertisers is that they can now directly target the Fire TV customer base, which tends to include Prime subscribers and younger families, through Amazon’s DSP. This lets Amazon leverage the company’s broader advertising team and capabilities to sell Fire TV’s FAST channel ad space. Amazon notes it’s sold over 200 million Fire TV devices globally and Amazon’s ad-supported streaming solutions now reach an average of 155 million unduplicated monthly viewers, or 6 out of 10 adults in the U.S. The company also cited a customer success story where an automotive client ran native ads on Fire TV and Fire tablets that led to an 11% lift in brand awareness and a 14% increase in purchase intent. Plus, citing Nielsen data, Amazon said 72% of its streaming TV viewers are not watching linear TV. Amazon isn’t the only streamer offering FAST channels these days, however. Competitor Roku has over 350 FAST channels on its platform as of March. Google TV just announced over 800 FAST channels, and YouTube has been experimenting with them, as well. Plex, Warner Bros. Discovery, Tubi, and Sling TV, among others, are also wading into this market, historically led by services like Pluto TV. The new Fire TV experience will be rolling out to customers this week, Amazon said. Customers will be able to find the new content tiles via the Fire TV Home Screen, as well as within Fire TV’s “Free” tab. Later this summer, Fire TV will bring all the FAST categories together with the launch of an always-on Fire TV Channels destination.  "
475,"Apple releases iOS 16.4 with new emojis, web push notifications, voice isolation for calls & more","['Ivan Mehta', 'Sarah Perez']","March 27, 2023","Apple today released the iOS 16.4 update to users, which includes a number of new features, like an expanded set of emojis, voice isolation for calls, website push notifications and more. Users can update to the latest version by going to Settings > General > Software Update. While iOS updates often simply patch security holes or tweak smaller settings, those that deliver new emojis or expanded functionality are often more popular with consumers, leading to high demand for the download. That means you may have to wait a bit in order to install the latest update on your device. With iOS 16.4, users are getting 31 new emojis. (The release notes reference “21” new emoji, but this just has to do with how the variations are counted). Among the new additions are a shaking face, the long-awaited pink heart, two pushing hands, a Wi-Fi symbol and others, including various animals and objects. The Unicode consortium approved these emojis last year, and it was announced in February they would become available with the latest iOS update. The new set also includes gray and light blue hearts, a folding hand fan, ginger, a pea pod, jellyfish, a moose, a goose, a hair pick, maracas, a flute and several others. You can read more about the new emojis here.   Another new feature is voice isolation for cellular calls that will prioritize your voice and block out ambient noise around you. This will make for clearer phone calls, as you’ll be able to hear the voice of the person speaking and not whatever is taking place in the background — like other people talking or noises from their environment. The feature had already been available for FaceTime calls and other VoIP apps, but not for cellular (until now). To enable the feature, you’ll need to open the Control Center while on the call, tap on Mic Mode, then choose Voice Isolation from the list. Last year at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple had shown a feature that allowed developers to send web-based push notifications to end users. The company rolled out this feature for Safari 16.1 with an update to macOS Ventura. Now, it’s letting iOS developers send a notification to users (after seeking permission), when the user has pinned a web app to their Home Screen. This feature could be immediately useful to some of the new Twitter rivals like Post and T2 that haven’t yet built out native iOS versions of their apps but still want to alert users to important conversations. But it also provides a way for Apple to counteract claims that its App Store is the only way to reach mobile consumers, which could help it fight off antitrust regulations and other lawsuits. The update release notes also reference a few other tweaks and fixes, including the following:"
476,Pitch for the check you want ,['@nmasc_'],"April 29, 2023","Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host Natasha Mascarenhas. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. Tech’s guiding principles these days aren’t too difficult to find: discipline, focus and cash conservation. But I’ve always found those same focuses to be especially in conflict with what it means to be an early-stage founder pitching your vision: You have to have Elon Musk-level ambition, big dreams and the ability to sell a company to investors before there are any real metrics behind it. In some ways, it’s the job of the investor to see the reason to say yes anyway. In other ways, the downturn is very much making early-stage founders professionalize sooner and sooner; philosophically looking more like the late-stage company pitching for its Series C than the buzzy pre-seed. I’ve been noticing small things about how early-stage founders have changed their pitches, suggesting that the checks are currently less about the messiah and more about the monetization. Read the rest of my column on TC+: “Founders change their pitch.” In the rest of this newsletter we’re talking about AI attribution, venture layoffs and modern entrepreneurship. As always, you can follow me on Twitter or Instagram to continue the conversation. If you feel like supporting me extra, subscribe to my very free Substack. Layoffs are almost a daily occurrence during this news cycle — I covered Chief and Clubhouse layoffs within an hour of each other — but the reasons behind each reduction often lack specificity. Dropbox surprised me. CEO Drew Houston, who laid off 16% of staff this week, cited “the AI era of computing” in relation to the layoffs. “We’ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we’ve been building toward this future for a long time, as this year’s product pipeline will demonstrate,” he said. Here’s what to know: I expect there to be more redundancies in workforces that are partially attributed to artificial intelligence. It’s not a new take: The concern I hear most often around AI is its ability, or intent, to replace everyone’s jobs. To break from that pattern is to land lots of snaps: Harvey AI, backed by Sequoia this week, is the buzz all over tech dinners for its pitch to supercharge lawyers. Image Credits: TechCrunch Image Credits: TechCrunch TC’s Mary Ann Azevedo broke news this week: “Fintech-focused VC firm Anthemis Group lays off 28% of staff as part of restructuring.” She reports, “Anthemis declined to provide further specifics around its strategy moving forward, instead pointing me to this blog post from co-founder Amy Nauiokas. In the post, Nauiokas writes that the firm aims to “translate 2022’s reckoning in private markets into enduring change in the structure and method of early-stage investing.” Here’s what to know: We don’t see venture layoffs often, even though I have a feeling many are ghosts these days. Reductions will continue — and maybe more loudly this time. Last June, Backstage Capital fired most of its staff, with now only two people remaining at the venture firm.   Image Credits: PM Images

477,Plural lures mRNA vaccine and AI pioneer to become its newest partner,['@mikebutcher'],"March 23, 2023","Some say the European tech startup ecosystem lacks investors who have been “operators,” as in former entrepreneurs. And indeed, that has been the case for many years. However, it’s good to see that this has been changing, even if the pace has been slow. One of the newest VC funds to wear its “former operators” badge on its sleeve is Plural, a VC we covered last year on its launch of a €250 million early-stage venture fund. To date, it has consisted of Taavet Hinrikus (co-founder of Wise), Sten Tamkivi (co-founder of Teleport), Ian Hogarth (formerly Songkick) and Khaled Helioui (a former tech CEO). That changes today with the addition of another former operator to its list of “peers” (their in-house term for what everyone else in VC-land calls general partners) in the shape of Carina Namih, a pioneer in mRNA technology and former CEO of HelixNano. HelixNano is an AI-driven biotech company that develops mRNA vaccine technology, and which, among other things, tackled the fight against COVID and cancer. HelixNano started in San Francisco in 2013. She later left the Y Combinator-backed company, moving to a board role, which she will be maintaining, and between 2018 and until Summer 2022, worked with U.K. fund Episode One doing B2B seed-stage investing as a general partner. A trustee of the Alan Turing Institute, Namih says she is joining Plural because of the collective operational experience and the “scar tissue” of the founders. “Since leaving HelixNano, I’ve been in the U.K. for a few years, investing in different founders. When I met the guys at Plural we realized we’d been in similar businesses, investing in similar founders. When they started talking to me about the idea of joining Plural, I felt that it was really unique and really needed in Europe. Having a place where a group of genuinely experienced founders with real scar tissue coming together as peers and backing the next generation of epic European businesses is just something that, until now, been really lacking in Europe.” “I think ex-operators understand businesses in a way that VCs often can’t. When we started HelixNano, it was visionary founders and operators, people like Eric Schmidt and Sam Altman, who gave us our first go. It was not the VCs,” she explained to me over a call. She added: “I like finding really talented contrarian founders who can see a structural shift coming, whether it’s technical or behavior change before others, and that’s really what we did with HelixNano, you know. We were applying AI and computational approach to mRNA long before that became clearer to the wider world.”   As an angel or VC Namih has so far invested in Omnipresent, the remote work platform; Phasecraft, the quantum software company spun out of UCL; Robin AI, a generative AI company for the legal sector; and AtlasML, tools for the machine learning community, acquired by Meta AI. In a statement, Ian Hogarth, Plural Unemployable, added: “With her scar tissue from HelixNano and experience as an investor, Carina brings great wisdom and impeccable judgment to our group. She knows, firsthand, how to hire exceptional talent, how to find product-market-fit in a monopolistic and opaque industry with entrenched incumbents and how to commercialize a general purpose technology. Carina can empower founders to achieve their ambitions and we’re thrilled she is a part of Plural.” Plural has also appointed four legal, IR and operations professionals to scale its offering: Daniel Tarver, head of Investor Relations, Kate Connolly, chief of Staff, Tamsin Ashworth Reeves, general Counsel and Verner Uibo, head of Finance."
478,Twitter is randomly logging out users. You’re welcome.,['@sarahintampa'],"May 1, 2023","Twitter is not dead yet; it’s just randomly logging out a number of its users. After TechCrunch reported earlier today that Twitter was experiencing a bug that was allowing people to edit their bios to briefly regain their Verified check marks, the Twitter website this afternoon has begun to forcefully log out users at random. There are a number of complaints about the problem on Twitter itself, indicating that at least some are able to get back in after being booted from the site. The issue appears to be impacting desktop users at this time who are using Twitter via the web. Some claim they’re being logged out repeatedly. The issue occurs when you’re browsing the Twitter website, we found. The page refreshes and then Twitter users (including several of us here at TechCrunch) are taken to the default website for Logged Out users. This page shows a curated selection of tweets and options to sign in through Google or Apple or by creating a new account. Many people (tweeting via their phones, we guess) say they’re unable to get back into the site through any of the usual methods. We’re facing that problem, too, having gotten to the screen where we can enter the code from a code generator app. But after the code is entered, the page only refreshes and returns us to the same Logged Out page once again. The Downdetector website also shows a sharp increase in user complaints about the site, indicating the problem is fairly widespread. Image Credits: Downdetector Image Credits: Downdetector Twitter has yet to acknowledge the problem via its official Twitter or Twitter Support accounts. A tech reporter at The New York Times, Ryan Mac, tweeted that the issue was caused by a bad front-end deployment, sources said. The bug is yet another example of the growing slate of issues that have followed Elon Musk’s takeover of the social network and the significant layoffs of engineering staff that the transition entailed. Since then, Twitter has experienced a range of problems, including glitches with Twitter Circle that showed private tweets to the public, broken timelines, broken links and images, and misfired error messages, and it experienced multiple outages. At the same time, the company is pitching itself to advertisers and creators, and suggesting its future will involve becoming a super app that also offers payments. Over the weekend, in fact, Musk even touted how media publishers — a group he recently alienated by dubbing outlets like NPR and PBS “government-funded” — would be able to offer micropayments for individual articles through Twitter. A similar concept is now being trialed by Twitter rival Post. It’s not clear whether any of Twitter’s big plans will ever gain traction, however. After all, it’s hard to sell much of anything on a website users can’t access.  "
479,"The market has changed, but super-voting shares are here to stay, says Mr. IPO",['@cookie'],"March 28, 2023","Yesterday, the ride-sharing company Lyft said its two co-founders, John Zimmer and Logan Green, are stepping down from managing the company’s day-to-day operations, though they are retaining their board seats. According to a related regulatory filing, they actually need to hang around as “service providers” to receive their original equity award agreements. (If Lyft is sold or they’re fired from the board, they’ll see “100% acceleration” of these “time-based” vesting conditions.) As with so many founders who’ve used multi-class voting structures in recent years to cement their control, their original awards were fairly generous. When Lyft went public in 2019, its dual-class share structure provided Green and Zimmer with super-voting shares that entitled them to 20 votes per share in perpetuity, meaning not just for life but also for a period of nine to 18 months after the passing of the last living co-founder, during which time a trustee would retain control. It all seemed a little extreme, even as such arrangements became more common in tech. Now, Jay Ritter, the University of Florida professor whose work tracking and analyzing IPOs has earned him the moniker Mr. IPO, suggests that if anything, Lyft’s trajectory might make shareholders even less nervous about dual-stock structures. For one thing, with the possible exception of Google’s founders — who came up with an entirely new share class in 2012 to preserve their power — founders lose their stranglehold on power as they sell their shares, which then convert to a one-vote-per-one-share structure. Green, for example, still controls 20% of the shareholder voting rights at Lyft, while Zimmer now controls 12% of the company’s voting rights, he told the WSJ yesterday. Further, says Ritter, even tech companies with dual-class shares are policed by shareholders who make it clear what they will or will not tolerate. Again, just look at Lyft, whose shares were trading at 86% below their offering price earlier today in a clear sign that investors have — at least for now — lost confidence in the outfit. We talked with Ritter last night about why stakeholders aren’t likely to push too hard against super-voting shares, despite that now would seem the time to do it. Excerpts from that conversation, below, have been lightly edited for length and clarity. TC: Majority voting power for founders became widespread over the last dozen years or so, as VCs and even exchanges did what they could to appear founder-friendly. According to your own research, between 2012 and last year, the percentage of tech companies going public with dual-class shares shot from 15% to 46%. Should we expect this to reverse course now that the market has tightened and money isn’t flowing so freely to founders? JR: The bargaining power of founders versus VCs has changed in the last year, that’s true, and public market investors have never been enthusiastic about founders having super voting stock. But as long as things go well, there isn’t pressure on managers to give up super voting stock. One reason U.S. investors haven’t been overly concerned about dual-class structures is that, on average, companies with dual-class structures have delivered for shareholders. It’s only when stock prices decline that people start questioning: Should we have this? Isn’t that what we are seeing currently? With a general downturn, even if a company is executing according to plan, shares have fallen in many cases. So you expect that investors and public shareholders will remain complacent about this issue despite the market. In recent years, there haven’t been a lot of examples where entrenched management is doing things wrong. There have been cases where an activist hedge fund is saying, “We don’t think you’re pursuing the right strategy.” But one of the reasons for complacency is that there are checks and balances. It’s not the case where, as in Russia, a manager can loot the company and public shareholders can’t do anything about it. They can vote with their feet. There are also shareholder lawsuits. These can be abused, but the threat of them [keeps companies in check]. What’s also true, especially of tech companies where employees have so much equity-based compensation, is that CEOs are going to be happier when their stock goes up in price but they also know their employees will be happier when the stock is doing well. Before WeWork’s original IPO plans famously imploded in the fall of 2019, Adam Neumann expected to have so much voting control over the company that he could pass it along to future generations of Neumanns. But when the attempt to go public backfired — [with the market saying] just because SoftBank thinks it’s worth $47 billion doesn’t mean we think it’s worth that much —  he faced a trade-off. It was, “I can keep control or take a bunch of money and walk away” and “Would I rather be poorer and in control or richer and move on?” and he decided, “I’ll take the money.” I think Lyft’s founders have the same trade-off. Meta is perhaps a better example of a company whose CEO’s super-voting power has worried many, most recently as the company has leaned into the metaverse. A number of years ago, when Facebook was still Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg proposed doing what Larry Page and Sergey Brin had done at Google but he got a lot of pushback and backed down instead of pushing it through. Now if he wants to sell off stock to diversify his portfolio, he gives up some votes. The way most of these companies with super voting stock are structured is that if they sell it, it automatically converts into one-share-one-stock sales, so someone who buys it doesn’t get extra votes. A story in Bloomberg earlier today asked why there are so many family dynasties in media — the Murdochs, the Sulzbergers — but not in tech. What do you think? The media industry is different from the tech industry. Forty years ago, there was analysis of dual-class companies and, at the time, a lot of the dual-class companies were media: the [Bancroft family, which previously owned the Wall Street Journal], the Sulzbergers with the New York Times. There were also a lot of dual-class structures associated with gambling and alcohol companies before tech firms began [taking companies public with this structure in place]. But family firms are nonexistent in tech because the motivations are different; dual-class structures are [solely] meant to keep founders in control. Also, tech companies come and go pretty rapidly. With tech, you can be successful for years and then a new competitor comes along and suddenly . . . So the bottom line, in your view, is that dual-class shares aren’t going away, no matter that shareholders don’t like them. They don’t dislike them enough to do anything about them. Is that right? If there was concern about entrenched management pursuing stupid policies for years, investors would be demanding bigger discounts. That might have been the case with Adam Neumann; his control wasn’t something that made investors enthusiastic about the company. But for most tech companies — of which I would not consider WeWork — because you have not only the founder but employees with equity-linked compensation, there is a lot of implicit, if not explicit, pressure on shareholder value maximization rather than kowtowing to the founders’ whims. I’d be surprised if they disappeared."
480,"This robot dog can play soccer on grass, mud and sand",['@bheater'],"April 3, 2023","Here’s a fun challenge: teaching a quadrupedal robot to successfully dribble a soccer ball. It is, in essence, a core component of RoboCup, the big international competition founded all the way back in 1996. Soccer is a great way to put a robot’s locomotion, agility and decision making to the test. Two key differences with MIT’s Dribblebot: First, the RoboCup robots are generally bipeds. Second, and more importantly, this robot is designed to perform the complex task on uneven and changing terrain, adding yet another level of difficulty to the task. “Past approaches simplify the dribbling problem, making a modeling assumption of flat, hard ground,” project co-lead Yandong Ji said in a post tied to the news. “The motion is also designed to be more static; the robot isn’t trying to run and manipulate the ball simultaneously. That’s where more difficult dynamics enter the control problem. We tackled this by extending recent advances that have enabled better outdoor locomotion into this compound task which combines aspects of locomotion and dexterous manipulation together.” Potential terrains include grass (naturally), sand, gravel, mud and snow. The answer to all of the above is one that should be familiar to anyone with passing familiarity with the robotics space of late: simulation, simulation, simulation. In training, the physical robot is regarded as a “digital twin,” getting put through its paces as computers run 4,000 simultaneous simulations of different environments. This sort of training clearly has broader applications beyond the admittedly narrow world of robot soccer. The debate around the efficacy of legged robots rages on, but one thing is certain: There are limitations to how far you can currently go on wheels. “If you look around today, most robots are wheeled. But imagine that there’s a disaster scenario, flooding, or an earthquake, and we want robots to aid humans in the search and rescue process. We need the machines to go over terrains that aren’t flat, and wheeled robots can’t traverse those landscapes,” says MIT professor, Pulkit Agrawal. The whole point of studying legged robots is to go to terrains outside the reach of current robotic systems.” Of course, Dribblebot has its own limitations, as well. Stairs and inclines still present a challenge for the little robot."
481,Google Meet now lets you pause video streams of individual tiles,['@indianidle'],"April 20, 2023","Google Meet is rolling out a new feature that will allow you to pause the video streams for individual tiles to improve focus on frequent speakers or presenters. To turn off individual feeds, you can tap the three-dot menu next to the person’s name in the sidebar on the web, and click on “Don’t watch.” On mobile, there is a new “Audio only” mode, which turns off all feeds apart from the presenter’s feed. Hopefully, Google rolls out this facility to desktops as well. The “Audio only” mode is certainly helpful to save data if you are on the move. Google said that Meet won’t notify others when you switch off their video feeds. Plus, their meeting experience will remain unchanged. The company said it has already started to roll out the feature and will make it available to the entire base in a few weeks. Thankfully, admins can’t turn off the feature for individuals, so it will be available to users at all times. Earlier this year, Google introduced support for emoji reactions on Meet calls. In February, the company brought 360-degree virtual backgrounds for Meet on mobile.  "
482,"Meditation app Simple Habit sells to wellness marketplace Ingenio, pivots the company to Sleep Reset",['@indianidle'],"March 29, 2023","Y Combinator and Foundation Capital-backed meditation app Simple Habit has been acquired by Alpine Investors-backed wellness marketplace company Ingenio. Because of this deal, Simple Habit will rebrand itself to Sleep Reset — eponymous to a sleep-focused app it launched last year. Simple Habit was founded by Yunha Kim in 2016 with the aim to be the “Netflix of Meditation.”. The company got $12.5 million in total funding from various investors, including Y Combinator and Foundation Capital. The app boasts more than 5 million users. Last year, Kim launched Sleep Reset as she saw that while only 10% of content on Simple Habit was related to sleep, it brought in 70% of engagement. The new paid app was developed in partnership with experts from the University of Arizona, the University of Minnesota and the Stanford University Sleep Medicine Center to develop its program. It took a no-pill approach and brought Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in an app form. Users who subscribed to the app got a dedicated coach to improve their sleep. Kim told TechCrunch that since the launch last year, more than 8,000 users have paid for the app. She said that with $155,000 in revenue last month, the app is set to clock $1.86 million in its first year. She also said that the company has improved sleep and habit logging on the app and doubled the number of sleep coaches since the launch. “In the nine months since we came out of beta, we’ve more than doubled our subscriber base and our revenue. We’ve made updates to our program which have driven increased engagement and our efficacy data remains very strong, with the average program graduate reporting over an hour more of sleep per night, and 53% less time needed to fall asleep,” she said. Ingenio has a rather intriguing curve as a company. It was founded as Keen.com in the 90s — a platform to connect users to psychics for readings. In the 2000s, the company rebranded itself and launched the personal guidance platform Ingenio and sold it to AT&T. In 2013, it was sold to San Francisco-based Alpine Investors. Since then, it has acquired multiple media properties like Horoscope.com and Astrology.com. In 2021, Alpine spun off Ingenio with a continuation fund. The company has a blog post that says Apollo is an investor, but there are no details in the post (Apollo owns Yahoo, which owns TechCrunch). When asked about Apollo’s investment, Ingenio pointed to an Alpine press release about the single-asset continuation vehicle for the company, which doesn’t mention Apollo. Bryan Leppi, Ingenio’s Chief Corp Dev Officer, told TechCrunch over an email that the company is acquiring Simple Habit to bolster its holistic wellness portfolio. He mentioned that Simple Habit — which has more than 90,000 active users — will continue as a product and Kim will join Ingenio’s advisory board. “Simple Habit will continue as a stand-alone product as well as a further wellness content layer for Ingenio’s global brand footprint. The meditation and audio wellness content from Simple Habit may be added to apps like Keen to expand access to healthy habit formation and balanced lifestyles,” Bryan said.  Ingenio or Sleep Reset didn’t comment on the size of the deal. Kim said that Sleep Reset as a company will focus on better personalization for different kinds of sleep problems with advice from sleep experts on the team."

A relentless, untamed wilderness, AI’s enigmatic potential stretches to infinity, evoking both wonder and trepidation.

484,Woolly introduces a Twitter and TweetDeck-inspired Mastodon app,['@sarahintampa'],"March 24, 2023","The slow but steady Twitter exodus has brought a new abundance of third-party Mastodon apps like Ivory, Mammoth and Ice Cubes that connect users to the increasingly popular open source and decentralized social network. Today, we can add one more app to that list with the launch of Woolly, another solidly built iOS Mastodon client focused on offering a more customizable home screen, threaded views for reading longer conversations and a TweetDeck-inspired layout for the iPad. According to Woolly’s creator, Matteo Villa, the main differentiator between his app and others is the approach he took to home screen customization. With Woolly, users can pin things like multiple remote timelines, lists, bookmarks, search, hashtags or even other user profiles directly to the app’s main tab bar, enabling quick and easy access to your favorite content. You can also customize the icon associated with each pinned section for a more personalized experience. Image Credits: Woolly Image Credits: Woolly On both iPhone and iPad, the different pinned “columns” can be accessed by tapping on their icon, but on iPad, the columns are also presented in a TweetDeck-like view. This latter option may appeal to those who were more heavily dependent on Twitter’s often-ignored social media dashboard app, which the company has seemingly been winding down by dropping the TweetDeck Mac app last summer after discontinuing its mobile client and Windows support in prior years. (And of course, it’s unclear to what extent TweetDeck even has a future under Elon Musk’s ownership.) Image Credits: Woolly Image Credits: Woolly Another standout feature in Woolly’s new app is its support for threaded conversations, which resembles Twitter’s own look and feel, complete with connective lines between posts to help you follow the replies as you scroll down. The feature aims to offer “a better reading experience for longer conversations,” Villa explains, which was something he particularly missed when he switched to Mastodon’s official app. The similarity between Woolly and Twitter doesn’t stop there, either. Even the line of icons for engaging with Mastodon posts feels a bit familiar, as the row starts with the reply button on the far left, followed by the retweet (or “boost” in Mastodon lingo), then the heart icon for favoriting a post, as on Twitter. Image Credits: Woolly Image Credits: Woolly There are several other nice touches in Woolly, too, like a way to filter your timeline to hide boosts and replies, settings that let you specify if you want to open links in-app or in the system browser, a selection of both light and dark mode themes to choose from, toggles for hiding or unhiding sensitive media or hiding posts with content warnings, plus access to trending posts, links and hashtags. At launch, Woolly is still not as feature-rich as some other apps, like Ivory, which includes access to things like analytics and more custom timeline filters. However, Woollly comes across as a polished and stable app that also has the potential to make former Twitter users feel more comfortable when making the switch to Mastodon. Since Musk’s takeover of Twitter, the federated social web has been gaining ground, as some former Twitter users began to experiment with other places to socialize online. Mastodon’s user base has grown too, as a result, reaching 2.5 million monthly actives by year-end. Though some Twitter users have since departed, the network still has 1.2 million monthly active users and the wider Fediverse of decentralized social apps has grown to 2.3 million monthly actives. Recently, Mastodon has seen an uptick as services like Flipboard and Medium began setting up their own servers for their own customers to use. Plus, WordPress.com’s owner just bought a plugin that allows blogs to reach readers on federated platforms. Over time, these moves could potentially grow the number of active users on the Fediverse. Available today on the App Store, Woolly is available as a free download so you can take a look and test it out. But if you want to actually use the app to post to Mastodon you’ll have to purchase its in-app subscription. Currently, this costs either $0.99 per month or $6.99 per year and offers the ability to log in to multiple accounts, customize the main tab bar, unlock more themes and, soon, utilize Home Screen widgets, too.

485,Opera brings its free VPN to iOS to rival Apple and Google’s paid alternatives,['@sarahintampa'],"April 12, 2023","Opera, the makers of an ad-blocking web browser, whose most recent claim to fame is having TikTok built-in, announced today it’s rolling out an updated version of its iOS app that now includes its free VPN. Previously available on Mac, Windows, Linux and Android, the iOS release now makes Opera the first browser to offer a free VPN service across all major computing platforms, the company touted in its announcement. The news is particularly timely given that, late last year, Opera’s largest competitor Google expanded its own VPN tool to desktop users on Mac and PC, after earlier supporting iOS and Android. But in Google’s case, its VPN is available only to subscribers on its Google One paid plans. Apple also offers a tool for encrypting an internet connection with its iCloud Private Relay feature, though it’s not really a VPN. But like Google, it’s also only available as part of a paid subscription (iCloud+). Image Credits: Opera Image Credits: Opera Opera’s VPN, meanwhile, does not require a subscription. The company says users don’t have to create an account to log in or use the feature. Opera also notes it doesn’t collect any personal information or data relating to the user’s browsing habits or their originating IP address. And the service doesn’t require any additional extensions to use — users can activate it from the main menu in the app to begin encrypting their VPN traffic. The company is able to offer free tools to end users because it generates revenue through other channels, including search and ad revenues, as well as technology licensing fees. It’s projecting $370-$390 million in revenues for 2023, for instance. Still, some users may not feel comfortable with Opera’s VPN service given the Norwegian company was sold to a Chinese consortium in 2016. It bought back shares from Qihoo 360 in 2022 and its largest stockholder is now  Kunlun Tech Co, publicly traded on the Shenzhen stock exchange. The nature of U.S.-Chinese relations now has the government weighing a ban on TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps, which could potentially complicate Opera’s future plans. (Opera, however, points out that it’s headquartered in Oslo and GDPR-compliant, noting it handles user data as dictated by European laws and regulations regardless of our ownership). Some security researchers have also criticized Opera’s default privacy setting with regard to advertising and personalization. Opera disputes these findings as highly problematic and inaccurate. For iOS users, the Opera mobile browser app aims to differentiate itself beyond the new VPN feature alone. The app includes other unique tools, like a “My Flow” for file sharing between devices, a native Crypto Wallet feature, a built-in ad blocker and a security-focused cryptojacking protection feature, among others. With today’s update, the iOS app is gaining a couple of other additions, too, including a new Bookmarks feature for organizing favorite content, and a Live Scores feature for tracking sports teams’ latest scores via a scoreboard on the browser’s homepage. However, Opera cautions that while the features, including the VPN are launching starting today, the full rollout will actually take place over the weeks ahead. That means you may not immediately see the new VPN feature when you launch the iOS app, but should soon. Updated 4/13/22 with additional information about Opera ownership and its disputes over security concerns."
486,5 growth lessons I learned while scaling from $0 to $1M ARR,['@jon4growth'],"April 3, 2023","While building a startup may seem easier than ever because of the assortment of tools available, the available statistics on being successful still do not favor founders. In the past year, I’ve had the privilege of co-founding Sales Kiwi, a virtual sales staffing and marketing service company, from ground zero to over $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and more than 25 employees. What separates the startups that succeed over those who fail? While I don’t have a crystal ball to predict everyone’s futures, I do have a wealth of stories and experience gained from my work scaling our company. I’m here to share my top five growth lessons, with the aim to help you avoid making the same mistakes that we made early on. Once we had found success on a specific channel, I’d follow the same principles with other forms of growth marketing, such as lifecycle, referrals or affiliates. My first lesson can seem a bit obvious, but not spreading oneself too thin early on is imperative. In the area of growth specifically, I never tested more than two paid channels at a time, which is how I was ultimately able to unlock acquisition for my team. This applies for all forms of growth, so if you’re trying to unlock lifecycle marketing, don’t also put efforts into unlocking four paid channels at the same time. This gave me the ability to optimize and experiment with the channels that I was immediately working on rather than taking the approach of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what stuck. Once we had found success on a specific channel, I’d follow the same principles with other forms of growth marketing, such as lifecycle, referrals or affiliates. In contrast, you also need to ensure you don’t spend excessive time focusing on one channel that isn’t showing any viability. A quick back-of-the-envelope method to assess whether you may find success on a channel, or not, is if your customer acquisition cost (CAC) is 5x where it should be, or you’re only seeing sub-5% of your conversions coming from the growth pillar after a few weeks of testing. There are a few exceptions to this such as content or SEO that typically have longer timelines before you encounter success. It’s not easy to have perfect reporting. This is especially true for startups. One of the biggest shortcomings at my startup was attempting to perfect our tracking with complex dashboards on our customer relationship management (CRM) software. As we scaled rapidly, we kept trying to create new dashboards to accommodate the new data points we wanted to measure, which was ultimately a big mistake. Today, I am a firm believer that perfection can either make or break startups early on, and the first $1 million in ARR does not require expensive tools for reporting. Instead, one should leverage free tools like Google Sheets to create reports for your growth funnel, retention and any other tracking that you’re looking to measure. There are also many resources, such as GooDocs, which provide free templates for revenue tracking or project management that can be customized to your startup. It does not make sense to spend time reinventing the wheel with fancy frameworks when you can easily download a free template."
487,AI assistants come to Alibaba and a16z-backed Cider,['@ritacyliao'],"April 25, 2023","The generative AI world is evolving so rapidly that every few days we see startups rolling out new applications powered by large language models (LLMs). The latest attempt to monetize artificial intelligence comes from Mindverse AI, a Singaporean startup that is building an API interface, or what founder Fangbo Tao calls a “grounding layer” for businesses, to create smart agents with its own vertical memory and different skill sets using LLMs from OpenAI’s GPT series. Mindverse’s ChatGPT-like AI agents have already secured early users, including an undisclosed platform inside Alibaba’s ecosystem; a16z-backed fashion startup Cider, which is piloting the virtual assistant; and Hooked, a web3 education platform leveraging the startup’s AI agent to guide users through its site. Given its traction and investor excitement around conversational AI, it’s no surprise that Mindverse is nearing the completion of a Series A funding round of $10 million. Investors are likely reassured by Tao’s experience working on AI systems at tech behemoths in China and the U.S. After a stint at Facebook building its content understanding platform, Tao joined Alibaba in Hangzhou to help found an in-house AI lab before starting his own company. Mindverse’s virtual assistant for e-commerce sites. Image Credits: Mindverse AI Mindverse’s virtual assistant for e-commerce sites. Image Credits: Mindverse AI Mindverse’s last round, which picked up $7 million, valued it at $45 million and was led by Sequoia China with participation from Linear Capital, K2 Venture, Yinxinggu Capital and Plug and Play. Mindverse is essentially providing a platform that allows clients to quickly build specialized intelligent agents for different domains. This is what happens when a user lands on a Mindverse-powered ecommerce site: They will be greeted by a chatbot that’s absorbed all the inventory data from the site. Say the buyer asks something like, “What should I wear to my beachside vacation?” The bot will scour the products and show a few options. Conversing in a human-like manner, the shopping agent is also able to explain the products’ differences and suggest more alternatives if the user isn’t happy with its first recommendations — meaning the bot can learn from real-time conversations. Similarly, a hotel booking site can use Mindverse to create a virtual guide that recommends places to stay based on simple input like, “I’m planning a trip to San Francisco with my wife.” The locations shown will take into account both the husband’s and the wife’s interests rather than the universal tourist hotspots. This way of interfacing with web data, said Tao, is fundamentally different from the pre-generative AI era. “In the past, users were interacting with data sources through software and apps, or GUI [graphical user interface]. What we are doing now is adding an agent or copilot to aid the GUI… by training AI to autonomously learn the API, documents, data sources and instructions that we feed it so the agent can gain skillsets specific to the business scenarios and provide dynamic orchestration of those based on the user’s complex intention,” he explained. Mindverse AI’s CEO and founder Fangbo Tao explains how generative AI transforms the way we interact with web data. Image Credits: Mindverse Mindverse AI’s CEO and founder Fangbo Tao explains how generative AI transforms the way we interact with web data. Image Credits: Mindverse “The biggest difference is that existing recommendation algorithms are heavily reliant on data from the past and you aren’t able to specify your needs,” he continued. “What you click or buy determines what you see. Through [generative AI], on the other hand, you can actively have a back-and-forth interaction with the AI agent that can digest your intention.” It doesn’t mean recommendation algorithms will become obsolete, though. Mindverse’s agents can in fact compare its recommendations to those from the algorithms that learn from past data. One way to integrate both solutions is to bake the old algorithms into the agent as an API, so the app can learn from users’ past behavior. In fact, any conventional capabilities behind software — beyond recommendation and search — can be baked into AI agents as API skills, the founder pointed out. “But the AI agent acts on a higher level. By chatting with users, it can better make use of the recommendation and search capabilities so as to plan the best way of using backend data,” said Tao.             "
488,Three-wheeled EV startup Arcimoto shuffles leadership again,['@harriblogs'],"April 20, 2023","A newish leadership team is taking over at Arcimoto, a Eugene, Oregon–based startup that makes doorless, three-wheeled electric vehicles. On Thursday, the company said that board member Chris Dawson will step in as CEO, replacing interim CEO Jesse Fittipaldi. Arcimoto added that Fittipaldi will stick around as president and report to Dawson going forward. Two executives also recently left the company — former chief financial officer Doug Campoli and former chief experience officer Lynn Yeager. Plus, Arcimoto’s product head Dwayne Lum is now the company’s chief operating officer. An Arcimoto staffer since 2015, Fittipaldi assumed the interim role in August, weeks after police reportedly slapped Arcimoto founder and former CEO Mark Frohnmayer with a DUI citation, according to Oregon news outlet the Register-Guard. Around this time, Dawson joined the startup’s board. Arcimoto said in a statement that its incoming CEO “most recently served as the Chief Executive Officer of Nikola Tesla Co.” Crucially, “Nikola Tesla Co.” is not associated with Nikola Corporation or Tesla Inc. Complicating matters (at least for this reporter), Arcimoto said that Dawson also spent five years at Tesla (the Musk one) working on “battery production, the Model S/X line and Model 3 general assembly.”  In a call with TechCrunch, Dawson said he “was a big Nikola Tesla fan” growing up. When I explained that I was puzzled by the name’s similarity to the aforementioned EV companies, Dawson said, “You’re right that it is confusing.” He added, “Every other day, I’ve got to kind of correct somebody as to my level of engagement with Tesla, because what also makes it confusing is that I spent a long period of time with Tesla.” I reached out to Tesla Inc. for more information, but I doubt I’ll hear back, given the dissolution of its media team. Arcimoto’s press release described Nikola Tesla Co. as an “engineering services company with projects that include electrification, hybridization, EV charging, hydrogen powertrain development, hydrogen powered VTOL, hydrogen power systems, fuel cell and hydrogen electrolyzer development.”  Dawson said the Texas-based corporation does consultancy work, but added that “we’re really more of a hands-on type organization.” According to the Dawson, Nikola Tesla Co.’s clients included a drone company called Tesla Aerial Robotics and the Department of Defense.  Asked for more details on his connection with the DoD, Dawson said, “I can’t go into a lot of detail, but generally, it is electrification, hybridization of current tactical equipment that is on the battlefield, as these different DoD organizations try to transition both to green more sustainable solutions, but also better.” TechCrunch reached out to the DoD for confirmation and will update this story when we hear back. Arcimoto ended 2022 with less than half a million dollars in cash on hand, warning investors in its annual report that it had “substantial doubt about [its] ability to continue” operating. Yet, earlier this year, the firm secured $18 million in additional funds via two separate raises, and said it would start shipping new EVs in March. According to Dawson, Arcimoto is now producing new vehicles every single week. He said the company cut costs over the past several months by laying off or ending contracts with about 200 people. The company has about 110 people on staff today, added Dawson. The incoming CEO told TechCrunch, “We believe, toward the end of the year, that we’ll be able to be — at a product level — profitable. And those pieces are really the bones that we need to move this forward.” Asked about future products, Dawson said Arcimoto is focused on its existing vehicles, which include its consumer-focused Fun Utility Vehicle and a delivery-focused version called the Deliverator."
489,There’s trouble in Startup Nation,['@abracarioca'],"April 1, 2023","W
elcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. Tel Aviv has the fifth most unicorn companies in the world. Yet, relatively little has been written outside of Israel about the major concerns local entrepreneurs are currently dealing with. We talked to one of them, MDI Health CEO Avishai Ben-Tovim. — Anna The Exchange recently noted how Sweden was punching above its weight in terms of startup dollars raised per capita. But Israel is even more outstanding when it comes to tech — so much so that it earned the nickname “Startup Nation.” Israel’s tech scene is also remarkably resilient and relatively immune from the country’s global and local political woes. But in recent months, the Israeli startup ecosystem has found itself at the forefront of the protests against the government’s highly controversial judicial reform plan. The reform, its opponents claim, would harm Israel’s democracy and its economy, in a country where the tech sector “makes up about 25 percent of Israel’s income taxes and contributes about 15 percent to the country’s annual GDP,” according to The Jerusalem Post. Driven by these political and economical worries, major players from the Israeli startup scene took a public stance; Index Ventures, for example, “denounce[d] the proposed reforms in Israel that foster discrimination and threaten democracy.” Others chose not to make official statements or formally join the strikes, leaving it up to their employees. But regardless of their position, many are concerned about the economic consequences that this political crisis might have. These concerns have also turned into actions, especially finance-related ones. In January, Reuters reported that an Israeli venture capital fund and a local startup were moving their bank accounts out of Israel, and others similarly started looking into keeping funds in different locations. MDI Health CEO Avishai Ben-Tovim was one of these. His health tech company, which has raised $26 million to date according to Crunchbase, is both Israeli and American. As political instability increased in Israel, it made sense to make good use of its Silicon Valley Bank account … until it didn’t. Ironically, Ben-Tovim found himself in the position of moving money back to Israel in a rush before the banking entity collapsed. "
490,Singapore-based Accredify gets $7M to make sure your documents are real,['@catherineshu'],"April 20, 2023","Interested in tech, Quah Zheng Wei left his career as a chartered accountant to teach himself how to code. But it was his experience as an accountant that led to his interest in the blockchain and how it can be used to verify documents. “What intrigued me was the capability of the technology to allow for real-time authentication,” Quah told TechCrunch. “That was mind-blowing because fundamentally, accountants are there to match certain transactions and make sure everything tallies up against one another. When I realized that technology can completely displace that activity, it intrigued me.” Co-founded by Quah in 2019 to securely verify documents, Singapore-based Accredify announced today that it has raised $7 million in Series A funding co-led by iGlobe Partners and SIG Venture Capital with participation from returning investors Pavilion Capital and Qualgro. So far, it has processed 12 million verifications on 2 million issued documents and served 600 users. Accredify began by working with educational organizations to prevent the use of fake degrees and certificates. Then it began expanding into other use cases, including corporate registries and healthcare. For example, during the height of the pandemic, Accredify worked with the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of Health to create a system that verified COVID-19 records so workers could travel. It has also collaborated with Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to transform their data infrastructure. This means that now every time a company is created, it receives a verifiable business profile that can be traced back to the blockchain. “I think being able to create this kind of commercial traction and adoption is something that we have done really well,” said Quah. Accredify onboards clients by first creating an identity for them on the blockchain (it primarily uses Ethereum). It creates a wallet, or document store, which is a smart wallet on the Ethereum network. It manages the private and public key for the client. Then it draws data through dashboards or API integrations. Other companies in the same space include Unifier, which Accredify partnered with during the pandemic — Accredify created documents while Unifier read documents for their clients. U.S. startups like Trinsic work with verifiable identity credentials, like New Zealand companies like MATTR are working with the country’s government to create digital identity and verifiable data. Quah said the key difference between Accredify and other players “is that most of the use cases you see in the market stop at the pilot, proof of concept situation. When it comes to true commercial adoption, as well as scalability, I don’t think a lot of companies have achieved what we’ve done, including creating an entire system that has enabled the COVID-19 management within Singapore to be so seamless.” Accredify has offices in Singapore and Australia, and it plans to double down on its presence in the latter country by hiring more people. Quah says it is also exploring expansion into Japan by doing pilot programs with government entities.  "
491,Tesla China boss Tom Zhu named SVP as country sales boom,['@ritacyliao'],"April 6, 2023","China has been a major sales driver for Tesla in recent times, thanks to the company’s aggressive price cuts. The country delivered 88,869 vehicles in March, according to fresh estimates from the China Passenger Car Association. That means more than half of the carmaker’s Q1 deliveries originated from its Shanghai factory.   It’s no surprise then that Tom Zhu, the executive behind Tesla’s rise in China, has quickly climbed through the company’s corporate ladder in recent years. Zhu began serving as the senior vice president of Tesla’s automotive unit in April, shows a new SEC filing. The appointment makes the executive one of the four most important faces at the electric vehicle powerhouse alongside CEO Elon Musk, CFO Zachary Kirkhorn and Andrew Baglino, SVP of powertrain and energy engineering. According to the filing, Zhu joined Tesla in 2014 and served in various operational roles before being named vice president of Greater China, where he led the construction and operations of Gigafactory Shanghai. As the firm’s China production went into full swing, the 43-year-old executive was brought to Texas to run the new Gigafactory in Austin, Bloomberg reported in December. The success of Tesla’s China factory didn’t come easily. Like Musk, Zhu is known for peaching a hardcore work ethic. During Shanghai’s COVID-19 lockdown, he slept in the factory with other workers to keep production running, according to a Reuters report.      "
492,The lowdown for European startups looking to raise money in 2023,"['Alex Wilhelm', 'Anna Heim']","March 31, 2023","We’re an impatient bunch here at TechCrunch+, so while we await tidied quarterly venture reports from major startup databases, we’re also running our own queries to get early looks at the state of the fundraising world. As it’s the last day of the first quarter, we’re too antsy to wait any longer to see what’s been going on in Europe. Let’s take an early peek. In the wake of Techstars’ decision to leave the Swedish market, we looked at Sweden’s startup scene earlier this week following a glance at what is happening in the United States. Those were useful exercises, but we’ll need a broader dataset to really set our bearings. To that end, let’s look at all of Europe and then consider the three largest venture markets in the region: the U.K., Germany and France. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. The numbers are fascinating and can be read as either bullish or bearish. The negative take is simple: European venture totals are down from a year ago. The more positive perspective is also worth considering: When we focus our view on just the last few quarters, it appears that venture is done contracting. Naturally, we’ll have oodles more data and charts when Q1 2023 data fully drops, but we can get a head start. Let’s talk Europe. European startups raised $28.85 billion across 2,274 deals in Q1 2023, according to preliminary PitchBook data. That’s less than in Q1 2021, but we already know (and you may be tired of hearing by now) that the 2021 venture vintage was an outlier. However, the figure also represents a year-on-year decline, which may sound like a surprise: In Q1 2022, the downturn had already started in the U.S. "
493,Pitch Deck Teardown: Prelaunch.com’s $1.5M seed deck,['@Haje'],"March 23, 2023","Hardware startups have a serious disadvantage over SaaS companies: Once you ship, it’s somewhere in the hard-to-impossible range to make changes to the product. That means you’d best get it right. But knowing what to ship can be challenging. Prelaunch.com first caught my eye at CES in Las Vegas this year, where the company had a “wall of flops”: products that were manufactured but didn’t find commercial success. Earlier this year, the company raised a $1.5 million seed round, and I already talked with the company’s founder about what it takes to de-risk hardware products. As part of that interview, I managed to talk the team into letting me take a closer look at the pitch deck it used to raise the $1.5 million. We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. Prelaunch obviously has a very clear idea of where it wants to go, and it presents that beautifully in its slide deck. At the same time, the company makes some pretty elementary mistakes, and the deck is missing some important information. Still, there’s a lot to love here, so let’s dive in and take a look. On Slide 8, the company shows the measured efficacy of what it does, essentially suggesting that it has developed a crystal ball of sorts. [Slide 8] Being able to predict how much demand there will be for a product with more than 85% accuracy is a hell of a feat. Image Credits: Prelaunch
When you are putting together your own slide deck, think about whether you have a similar metric you can refer to, one that illustrates how much better your customers’ lives will be if they use your product. [Slide 8] Being able to predict how much demand there will be for a product with more than 85% accuracy is a hell of a feat. Image Credits: Prelaunch In Slides 1-7, Prelaunch sets up its problem space and the challenges it is addressing in the hardware ecosystem. On this slide, it brings it full circle, claiming that what it is doing works extremely well. To hardware manufacturers and the people who know how they work, an 86% accuracy of product demand forecasting is as good as it gets; it may as well be a crystal ball. This is an incredibly powerful claim that goes a long way toward confirming that the company is building something that may well be an indispensable tool for hardware manufacturers. When you are putting together your own slide deck, think about whether you have a similar metric you can refer to, one that illustrates how much better your customers’ lives will be if they use your product. It’s a great storytelling tool — if it stands up to scrutiny. [Slide 12] Plenty of space to grow. Image Credits: Prelaunch
Market sizing is always an interesting challenge for startups, but Prelaunch’s vision, combined with its claims around how much it can de-risk hardware manufacturing, makes for a compelling story. Of course, many product launches do start with a market research phase already, but Prelaunch aims to put the expensive market research tools available to high-end product manufacturers in the hands of everyone, including startups, mom-and-pop manufacturing operators and people who are interested in doing human-informed product design. [Slide 12] Plenty of space to grow. Image Credits: Prelaunch [Slide 11] Showing what the tool does is helps explain why it’s useful. Image Credits: Prelaunch
Prelaunch uses four slides to show different aspects of its product, summarizing the analytics, reporting and a large part of the feature set that’s available within the company’s product. But it was able to do this with a simple set of screenshots, rather than overloading the slide with words. [Slide 11] Showing what the tool does is helps explain why it’s useful. Image Credits: Prelaunch   This part of the story is very show-don’t-tell, and it describes a couple of important things about the company and its product: It’s able to create complex dashboards that convey large amounts of information simply, and it’s able to build a product that’s intuitive and actionable. I usually only add three things I like, but I had to include this slide as well … [Slide 14] In the four months since launch, Prelaunch has seen incredible growth. Image Credits: Prelaunch
There’s one slide that will trump everything else that’s going on in the business, and that’s traction. An awful team that has traction is not an awful team. A dreadful product that is making revenue is not a dreadful product. I’m surprised the Prelaunch team waited until slide 14 to tout these numbers. But $133,000 ARR after only four months is incredibly impressive, and although the 800 companies registered could be a vanity metric, if those are all in-market buyers for a product like Prelaunch, that’s a beefy, promising pipeline.

494,Ronbow nabs $10M to deliver custom cabinets in as short as 3 weeks,['@ritacyliao'],"April 5, 2023","If you’ve ever renovated a house, you’ve suffered through the ordeal of getting custom-made cabinets, a costly and lengthy process that involves rounds of back-and-forth with dealers and designers taking up to half-a-year to complete. Now, a California-based startup, Ronbow, wants to shorten delivery times and reduce the costs of customized cabinets with its proprietary design and manufacturing software. The four-year-old company recently landed a $10.5 million Series A round led by Celtic House Asia Partners to add more showroom locations. Other investors from the round included AME Cloud Ventures, a fund started by Yahoo founder Jerry Yang; Harpers Investments; Haiping Jin, the founder of Telenav; Weili Dai, co-founder of Marvel; and Ming Zeng, former chief strategic officer at Alibaba. Ronbow’s CEO and founder Jason Chen worked in home luxury for over two decades, targeting mostly B2B clients, before moving into the startup world. Rather than taking the common route of designed-in-Europe, made-in-Asia and export-to-America, Ronbow is designing and making its furniture in the U.S. “In 2019, we changed our mind because everything was different,” the founder told TechCrunch, referring to the increasing supply chain uncertainty triggered by the U.S.-China trade war. “On the U.S. side, supply chains were going to be a big issue when the U.S. had issues with China. A fully custom product line was so expensive here with a long lead time that we figured there was an opportunity for us.” Ronbow offers what it calls an “end-to-end” solution that allows customers to connect directly with manufacturers, doing away with the middlemen who used to help pass on design files to factories. This is how it works: The startup’s design platform first helps customers figure out the style and size of cabinets they want. Then it feeds that information into the cutting machines equipped with Ronbow’s software, which drives the whole production process. The benefits of data-driven manufacturing are obvious. According to Chen, Ronbow can reduce completion time by 90% to deliver products in as little as three to six weeks and cut costs by 40% compared to the traditional, manual practice. Ronbow is projecting revenue of more than $10 million this year, and aims to open 10 showrooms. Most of its existing user base of about 1,000 customers are in California, ranging from middle-class homeowners, professionals like real-estate agents and designers, as well as commercial clients like hotels and developers. It aims to operate 30 showrooms by 2024, when it expects to see annual revenue of $50 million to $60 million.       "
495,"News app Artifact can now summarize stories using AI, including in fun styles",['@sarahintampa'],"April 25, 2023","Artifact, the personalized news aggregator from Instagram’s founders, is further embracing AI with the launch of a new feature that will now summarize news articles for you. The company announced today it’s introducing a tool that generates article summaries with a tap of a button, in order to give readers the ability to understand the “high-level points” of an article before they read. For a little extra fun, the feature can also be used to summarize news in a certain style — like “explain like I’m five,” in the style of Gen Z speech, or using only emojis, for example. These styles aren’t really meant to be useful; they’re just there to add a little whimsy to the feature and potentially encourage users to try the new feature. To use the AI summaries feature, tap on the “Aa” button found on the menu above an individual news article; then tap the new “Summarize” option. The company confirmed it’s leveraging OpenAI’s technologies via its API to generate text summaries. However, the company cautions users that the feature should not replace actually reading the news, as AI isn’t perfect. Image Credits: Artifact Image Credits: Artifact “It’s important to note that summaries don’t replace the utility of having the full text of the article,” the company blog post reads. “AI is powerful, but from time to time can make mistakes, so it’s important to verify the summary matches the article as you read the full text,” it warns. The company said it may add other fun styles for users to play with over time, in addition to those available at launch. The feature is just now rolling out to Artifact users, so you may not immediately see the Summarize option in your app, but should soon. Founded by Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Artifact’s original premise has been to offer a personalized experience around news reading, but not one that leaves users trapped in “filter bubbles” as they were on Facebook. Though Artifact’s home screen does present a curated selection of news tailored to the end user, based on their reading preferences and engagement, the headlines section of the app shows users the same news item as covered by a variety of sources across the wider news ecosystem. Artifact vets its news sources upfront for adhering to certain standards around integrity — like their fact-checking and corrections process, their transparency around funding, and more. Since its public launch in February, Artifact has been quickly iterating on its feature set, and earlier this month rolled out a social discussions feature that lets users comment on news items as well as upvote and downvote comments left by others. The company isn’t yet sharing how many people are now actively using its news app, but app intelligence firm data.ai reports the app has seen 240,000 downloads worldwide installs across both app stores to date. On the U.S. App Store, the app is currently ranked No. 115 in the News section.  "
496,Why is Discord making you change your name?,['@techcrunch'],"May 4, 2023","Popular chat and streaming app Discord is making every single one of its users change their names, and you could be forgiven for wondering why make such a disruptive move at all. But the platform’s founders say it’s more necessary than you might think. Ordinarily, Discord users are identified by a name and random number separated by a hash sign — like MinaHarker#1897. Originally, explains co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy, it would have just been MinaHarker, since they didn’t require unique names (you were just joining a friend’s channel), but later when they needed to differentiate users with identical names, they added the “discriminator” four-digit number. As Discord has grown, this same system has stayed in place, but it wasn’t ideal for sharing outside of Discord. Meet someone in real life and you can say, “I’m @BigDraculaEnergy on Instagram” or whatever. But few people remembered their four-digit number or indeed the capitalization of their name on Discord, which actually matters. “Well, figure it out,” you say, but the trouble is lots of people didn’t: “Almost half of all friend requests fail to connect the user with the person they wanted to match with, mostly because users enter an incorrect or invalid username due to a combination of missing discriminator and incorrect casing,” Vishnevskiy writes, and other problems were common as well. That kind of friction and frustration is bad news for a growing community trying to reach new audiences. So after long debate the team decided to take an approach that will be familiar to users of social networks: a unique username, plus a freely assignable display name that can be changed at any time. Illustration showing before and after Discord username and display names. Image Credits: Discord Illustration showing before and after Discord username and display names. Image Credits: Discord The problem is simply this: Despite already having a name, everyone will now need to pick a new one, which might or might not be similar to the old one. If our friend MinaHarker#1897 wants to snag her name, she may find that others have already done so, and though she used to be known just by her name, she now has to change something, perhaps adding periods, underscores or numbers (the only other permitted characters). It’s definitely arguable that m1na_h4rk3r is more difficult to say or search for than MinaHarker#1897. And with hundreds of millions of users who previously had whatever name they wanted, you can be sure that kind of conflict will be fairly common. Users are understandably upset over the change. It may well be that friend searches were awkward and often unsuccessful. But that’s a temporary inconvenience — you ask your friend again or check around and find the correct name. What about this couldn’t have been fixed by a smarter search function to help differentiate between Jonathan#6733, Jonathan#7633, and Jonathan#3367?   In solving some problems, it also introduces others — which will also be familiar to social media users. For instance, how will Discord ensure that notable online personalities aren’t targeted by impersonators? Every platform is in constant battle with impersonators, and one can hardly expect the average user to know whether @ninja or @ninja_ is the one they want. (And after all, why shouldn’t an actual ninja take one of those names?) Others have pointed out that Discord channels have been great for automatic functions (like Midjourney’s image generation, an enormous community there) and friendly bots, which might be broken or require serious rework to operate under the new conditions. Having a single universal nickname may not be everyone’s cup of tea, either. Do I want to be known by the same nickname on my K-drama channel as on my racing sim channel? The company hopes to avoid acrimony with a slow rollout and prioritizing usernames for people who have been on the platform the longest. But those users are likely to be the most ticked off, since they joined when Discord was a relatively no-frills chat app for gamers and other communities — this constant creep toward being a full-blown social network may eventually push them to explore alternatives.

497,Twitter’s mobile web app is currently down for some,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 4, 2023","A few days after a Twitter bug randomly logged some users out of their accounts, the company’s web app on mobile is now currently down for some. The social network’s mobile and desktop applications appear to be working fine. According to third-party web monitoring service Downdetector, the issue seems to have started at around 8:00 AM ET. Once you open the web page on your phone, you’ll see a notice that says “Nothing to see here” with a blurb that says “Looks like this page doesn’t exist. Here’s a picture of a poodle sitting in a chair for your trouble.” Image Credits: Screenshot/TechCrunch Image Credits: Screenshot/TechCrunch Twitter has yet to acknowledge the problem via its official Twitter or Twitter Support accounts. If we were to email Twitter asking for a comment regarding the outage, they would just email us back a poop emoji. The latest outage is yet another example of the growing slate of issues that have followed Elon Musk’s takeover of the social network and the significant layoffs of engineering staff that the transition entailed. Since then, Twitter has experienced a range of problems, including multiple outages. Update 05/04/2023 1:30 PM ET: The issues have been resolved."
498,Forget banks: Investors should be worrying about the climate,['@tdechant'],"March 26, 2023","The reports issued by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are usually grim affairs. But even by that standard, last week’s seemed particularly bleak. The upshot is that the world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius, and we’re on track to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius — the “safe” limit set by the Paris Agreement — in the early 2030s. So unless we make drastic changes, the world will blow past the amount of warming deemed safe just 10 years from now. There’s a good chance that by the time 30- and 40-year-olds hit retirement, the world will be shitting the bed. The hurricanes, heat waves, polar vortices, fires, floods, droughts — all the things that make us stock the pantry, invest in backup power and beef up our insurance policies — we’ll be waxing nostalgic about those. Wasn’t it cute how bad we thought things were back then? Where the fuck is the panic? To be sure, plenty of people are worried. Problem is, most of them don’t have (or can’t marshal) the sorts of sums required to put a dent in the problem. Meanwhile, those who do are largely sitting out one of the biggest crises — and one of the biggest opportunities — of their lifetimes. There are a handful of investors who “get it,” but most don’t. Rather than invest in fusion or batteries or carbon capture or grid management tools, they seem content plowing their money into ad optimization software, corporate spend cards, corporate SaaS platforms — CRM, marketing or payments, take your pick! — or anything to do with the metaverse, really. One after another after another. (Soon, AI chatbots will join the list because, come on, have you seen what happens after the latest toy lands on “60 Minutes”? It’s like a bunch of high schoolers rushing to ape the latest TikTok trend.) When they’re not busy financing incrementalism, they’re giving failed wunderkinds hundreds of millions of dollars or fanning the flames of runs on regional banks. Is that what they aspire to? It would be less frustrating if venture capitalism weren’t tailor-made to tackle a problem like this. Sizable but manageable risks? Check. Needle-moving technologies? Check. Enormous upsides and the potential to refashion trillion-dollar markets? Check and check. Where is everybody? Let’s compare two vastly different markets to illustrate the problem. Over here we have software as a service, which investors have lavished with money and attention because those companies produce recurring revenue, which is often steadier and more predictable. Altogether, SaaS companies worldwide raised $122 billion last year, according to PitchBook. In other words, to fund companies that lease software on a monthly basis rather than sell perpetual licenses, VCs invested more money than the entire GDP of Slovakia. On the other side we have clean energy, which includes everything from batteries to renewable fuels, building electrification, solar, wind and more. Here, investors placed $40 billion worth of bets last year. In case you’re bad at math, investments that eliminate carbon pollution in myriad sectors of the economy were one-third those made just to sell software on a monthly basis. Venture capitalists once backed companies that took big, consequential swings. In 1946, VC pioneer American Research and Development handed the founders of High Voltage Engineering a $200,000 check to develop a fledgling technology known as X-rays to treat cancer. At $2.8 million in today’s dollars, that may not seem like a lot of money. But remember, apart from ARD, venture capital didn’t exist back then. Today, those big swings are similarly modest. Probably too modest. Investors should be collectively ramping up their ambitions, but the numbers don’t reflect that. Let’s look at two “big swing” techs: carbon capture and fusion energy. Last year, global VC firms invested just $4.25 billion in carbon capture and a mere $1.1 billion in fusion energy, per PitchBook. Together, they represent a “get out of jail free” card, allowing humanity to produce enough energy to drive the power-hungry process of reversing nearly 200 years of unchecked carbon pollution. Fusion represents perhaps the riskiest bet of them all. The science has progressed rapidly in recent years, and many startups express growing confidence in their timelines, but there’s still plenty of risk involved. Yet the technology has such tremendous potential, both for the climate and for returns, that investors should be pouring enormous sums into the market. In that way, fusion shows a way forward. Most fusion companies will need a lot of money, and most probably won’t pan out. But those that do will deliver significant returns. Today, the global energy market is worth $10 trillion. If one company could capture even a sliver of that, it would be rewarded with an absolutely stratospheric valuation. Given the risky but promising nature of a fusion-heavy portfolio, let’s assume for the sake of argument that investors will need 1,000x return from a winner to cancel out losses from their failed bets. If today’s portfolios assume winners need to return 10x, that means venture capital will need to take 100x more shots. So either firms need to get way bigger or there need to be way more of them. The easiest solution, of course, would be for more firms to dive into fusion. But that would mean that many would fail, too. Fortunately, fusion isn’t the only climate tech that’s in need of investment. Opportunities are multiplying by the day. Some are riskier than others, but all of them are bets on the future. And given that all of our futures are tied to the climate, if any of those bets pay off, the returns will accrue not just to investors, but to everyone. In climate tech, venture capital has a chance to get back to its roots — investing not just for money but to change the world."
499,Meta says about 10% of its global ad revenue at risk from EU data flows order,['@riptari'],"April 27, 2023","Meta’s earning call yesterday was upbeat on better than expected revenue for the quarter. However buried in its disclosures to investors is a stark warning on looming regulatory risk it’s facing in Europe — where a decision is expected in a matter of weeks (by May 12) that could see the tech giant ordered to suspend its transatlantic data flows. “We expect the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to issue a decision in May in its previously disclosed inquiry relating to transatlantic data transfers of Facebook EU/EEA user data, including a suspension order for such transfers and a fine,” Meta’s CFO wrote in its Q1 2023 report. We’ve covered the (very) long-running saga — which hinges on a clash between US surveillance laws and EU privacy rights — most recently here and here. So regular TechCrunch readers will already know that a key development Meta is hoping will save its bacon in Europe is the adoption of a new high level data transfer pact which aims to resolve the legal uncertainty around EU data exports. However the negotiations over this replacement deal have dragged on longer than expected and EU institutions are still reviewing the draft decision the Commission announced in December. So while the bloc had initially suggested the deal might be finalized by the end of 2022, it was forced to revise the estimate — saying in December that it hoped everything would be nailed down before July. Since then, multiple EU institutions involved in reviewing the deal have been raising concerns — so there’s still no firm word on when exactly the thing might be done. (Or, indeed, whether a new deal will survive the inevitable legal challenges, given the two prior pacts got invalidated by the Court of Justice of the EU.) In its earnings report, Meta tells investors it’s hopeful the new EU-US data framework will arrive soon enough to be implemented before the deadline for a suspension of its EU transfers — meaning, were these stars to align, it could reboot its claim to have an authorized mechanism for its EU transfers and flick the suspension order away — however the company also warns it “cannot exclude the possibility” that adoption won’t happen soon enough to prevent such an order. “Our ongoing consultations with policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic continue to indicate that the proposed new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework will be fully implemented before the deadline for suspension of such transfers, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it will not be completed in time,” Meta writes. “We will also evaluate whether and to what extent the IDPC decision could otherwise impact our data processing operations even after a new data privacy framework is in force.” During a call with investors, the social networking giant was asked about the potential impact on revenues if it is forced to suspend EU-US data flows on regulatory order. Responding, CFO Susan Li began by reiterating its hope that the new high level framework will save its bacon. However, if this sought for escape hatch fails to open in time, she warned investors Meta is facing a hit of around a tenth of its worldwide ad revenue — saying “roughly 10%” of this comes from ads delivered to Facebook users in EU countries. Li caveated the disclosure by saying it’s difficult for Meta to forecast the overall impact of any EU data suspension at this point, given it lacks information on what a final order would contain — such as the length of a suspension. Earlier in the call Meta’s CFO offered a breakdown of ad revenue growth by regions, saying it was strongest in the “Rest of World” segment (at 9%) during the quarter, followed by North America and Asia-Pacific (6% and 4%, respectively) — while she specified that Europe had declined 1%.

500,Shein and Temu the latest China tech targets in Congress body’s sights,['@ritacyliao'],"April 18, 2023","As the U.S. becomes increasingly wary of China’s growing influence on the Western tech stage, internet platforms from TikTok to Shein are finding themselves in Washington’s sights. As a Chinese saying goes: The first bird that pokes its head out gets shot. In recent months, lawmakers in the U.S. have escalated efforts to ban TikTok. In December, the U.S. House of Representatives ordered its staff and lawmakers to delete the video app from their government-issued mobiles. A broader restriction appears to be looming after the app’s CEO Shou Zi Chew went through five hours of grilling questions before Congress in late March. Now Temu and Shein, two fast-growing e-commerce platforms that leverage China’s efficient supply chains to ship affordable goods to American consumers, are facing heightened scrutiny from Washington. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), a government organ created by Congress to report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the two countries, published a report detailing the “challenges” presented by Chinese fast fashion platforms. Those challenges include “exploitation of trade loopholes; concerns about production processes, sourcing relationships, product safety, and use of forced labor; and violations of intellectual property rights.” The report, which came out last Friday, singles out Shein and Temu as two foremost examples posing such risks to America. These concerns have been flagged before. For instance, Rick Helfenbein, former chairman of the Board of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, wrote back in 2021 that Shein and other similar direct-to-consumer e-commerce players managed to take advantage of the U.S. de minimis import exemption, which allows $800 per person per day to be free of tariff. But as Shein and Temu gain further ground in the U.S., their influence inevitably draws more attention. Shein was the most downloaded shopping app in the U.S. last year, overtaking Amazon; Temu, which is the sister app of China’s online deals giant Pinduoduo, managed to climb to the top of the U.S. app stores in the course of a few weeks. Shein responded to the USCC report in a statement: “As a global company with customers and operations around the world, Shein takes visibility across our supply chain seriously. For over a decade, we have been providing customers with on-demand and affordable fashion, beauty and lifestyle products, lawfully and with full respect for the communities we serve.” Temu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The fact that Shein is in the crosshairs of USCC goes to show the difficulty of trying to play down one’s China links. In an effort to shun the impact of geopolitical tensions, Chinese companies expanding in the West feel increasingly pressured to disassociate themselves from home. Many Chinese startups have expressed to TechCrunch their angst about being trapped in geopolitics while trying to build a genuinely competitive global product. As I wrote before, many of them are now moving their main entity abroad and even securing foreign citizenship for their executives, aside from basic practices like storing user data in the target markets rather than China. In Shein’s case, the fast fashion behemoth, which was founded in Nanjing and Guangzhou a decade ago, has made Singapore the home of its de facto holding company; its founder and CEO Sky Xu also reportedly became a permanent resident of Singapore, a country seen as politically neutral and favored as an overseas outpost by Chinese tech bosses for its cultural and geographic vicinity.

501,Hackers claim vast access to Western Digital systems,['@lorenzofb'],"April 13, 2023","The hackers who breached data storage giant Western Digital claim to have stolen around 10 terabytes of data from the company, including reams of customer information. The extortionists are pushing the company to negotiate a ransom — of a “minimum 8 figures” — in exchange for not publishing the stolen data. On April 3, Western Digital disclosed “a network security incident” saying hackers had exfiltrated data after hacking into “a number of the Company’s systems.” At the time, Western Digital provided few details about exactly what data the hackers stole, saying in a statement that the hackers “obtained certain data from its systems and [Western Digital] is working to understand the nature and scope of that data.” One of the hackers spoke with TechCrunch and provided more details, with the goal of verifying their claims. The hacker shared a file that was digitally signed with Western Digital’s code-signing certificate, showing they could now digitally sign files to impersonate Western Digital. Two security researchers also looked at the file and agreed it is signed with the company’s certificate. The hackers also shared phone numbers allegedly belonging to several company executives. TechCrunch called the numbers. Most of the calls rang but went to automated voicemail messages. Two of the phone numbers had voicemail greetings that mentioned the names of the executives that the hackers claimed were associated with the numbers. The two phone numbers are not public. Screenshots shared by the hacker show a folder from a Box account apparently belonging to Western Digital, an internal email, files stored in a PrivateArk instance (a cybersecurity product) and a screenshot of a group call where one of the participants is identified as Western Digital’s chief information security officer. They also said they were able to steal data from the company’s SAP Backoffice, a back-end interface that helps companies manage e-commerce data. The hacker said that their goal when they hacked Western Digital was to make money, though they decided against using ransomware to encrypt the company’s files. “I want to give them a chance to pay but our callers […] they have called them many times. They don’t answer and if they do they listen and hang up,” the hacker said. The hacker said they have also emailed several executives — using their personal email addresses because the corporate email system is currently down — demanding a “one-time payment.” “We are the vermin who breached your company. Perhaps your attention is needed!” the hackers wrote, according to a copy of the email the hackers shared with TechCrunch. “Continue down this path and we will retaliate.” “We only need a one-time payment, and then we will leave your network and let you know about your weaknesses. No lasting harm has been done. But if there are any efforts to interfere with us, our systems, or anything else. We will strike back,” the hackers continued. “We are still buried in your network and we will keep digging there until we find a payment from you. We can completely conceal this and make it all disappear. Before it is too late, let us do that. Until now, you have been gracious; Let’s hope that you do not keep going the wrong way.” “Cut the crap, get the money, and let’s both go our separate ways. Simply put, let us put our egos aside and work to find a resolution to this chaotic scenario,” the hackers wrote. Western Digital spokesperson Charlie Smalling said the company declined to comment or answer questions about the hacker’s claims, such as whether the company could confirm the amount of data stolen, if it included customer data and whether the company had made contact with the hackers. The hacker who spoke to TechCrunch declined to specify what kind of customer data they have, how they originally broke into Western Digital’s network and how they maintained access to the company’s network. “I can say that we exploited vulnerabilities within their infrastructure and spidered our way to global administrator of their [Microsoft] Azure tenant,” the hacker said. As for why they hacked Western Digital, the hacker said they just come up with targets “randomly.” They also declined to say anything about themselves or the group, saying they don’t go by any name. If Western Digital doesn’t get back to them, the hacker said, they are ready to start publishing the stolen data on the website of the ransomware gang Alphv. The hacker said they are not directly affiliated with Alphv but “I know them to be professional.” Do you have more information about the Western Digital hack? We’d love to hear from you.

502,Spain’s privacy watchdog says it’s probing ChatGPT too,['@riptari'],"April 13, 2023","Spain’s data protection authority, the AEPD, has followed Italy’s lead and announced a preliminary investigation of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over suspected breaches of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). At the end of last month, Italy’s DPA ordered OpenAI to stop processing locals’ data — over a range of suspected breaches of the GDPR — which swiftly led to OpenAI geoblocking the service in Italy. At the time of writing ChatGPT remains accessible via a Spanish IP address. But the regulator does not appear to have issued an order that it suspend processing.   In a press release about its action (which we’ve translated from Spanish) it writes: “The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) has initiated ex officio preliminary investigation proceedings against the U.S. company OpenAI, owner of the ChatGPT service, for possible non-compliance with the regulations.” The release does not provide any details of the specific concerns the AEPD has but we’ve reached out with questions. Italy’s DPA has raised a range of GDPR concerns over ChatGPT, including the lawfulness of OpenAI’s processing, transparency issues, plus child protection and data access requirements. Earlier this week it published a list of measures OpenAI must implement if it wants the local suspension order lifted, giving it a deadline of the end of the month to make most of the changes. OpenAI has not commented publicly on the changes the Italian agency has asked for. An OpenAI spokeswoman declined comment on the Spanish investigation now. The AEPD’s press release confirms it earlier asked the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body for applying the GDPR, to include ChatGPT in a plenary discussion this week. It says it made that ask considering OpenAI’s “global processing operations may have a significant impact on the rights of individuals” — which it also said may require “harmonized and coordinated actions at European level”. “The Committee decided at today’s plenary session to launch a task force to promote cooperation and exchange information on the actions carried out by data protection authorities,” the AEPD adds. The EDPB task force on ChatGPT will act in parallel to individual authority probes. But it may, ultimately, help to coordinate GDPR enforcement on the generative AI technology across the bloc. Although, in the short term, early mover DPAs like Italy and Spain could conclude their investigations and take enforcement action before the Board is in a position to offer any harmonizing recommendations. One difference of approach is already in evidence: With Italy’s DPA issuing a suspension order, while Spain’s AEPD has only announced it’s taking a preliminary look into ChatGPT at this stage. Though that could suggest Spain’s probe is less advanced than Italy’s. In further public remarks, the AEPD said it “advocates for the development and implementation of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence”. But it emphasized that such development must fully comply with the EU’s data protection framework and the rights and freedoms the GDPR affords individuals.

504,How this investor widens the net by refusing warm intros,['@Haje'],"May 1, 2023","I have often been annoyed by warm introductions. I get why investors insist on them, but it has always struck me as lazy and un-inclusive. So I was filled with great delight and curiosity when I was introduced to GoAhead Ventures. The firm claims it will hear anyone’s pitch, no matter where in the world you are or what you are building as long as you are a pre-seed or seed company. The catch? They insist on a video pitch. The upside? They promise to get back to you within a few days to let you know if you’re through to a partner meeting. Assuming the (very light) due diligence goes to plan and they like your company, you could have the money in your bank account within a week. This approach is different enough from most venture outlets that I decided to talk with Clancey Stahr and Phil Brady, both managing partners at the firm, to find out what life is like with the proverbial VC doors thrown wide open. I was also keen to get the inside track on what the firm looks for in investments and what founders can do to stand out. “When we were getting started, what we were doing was very similar to other VC firms: We were trying to do some thought leadership, do some grassroots marketing around the Stanford campus; that kind of stuff. But it wasn’t until COVID that we started to differentiate and move into our current process,” says Stahr, describing the firm’s journey from 2014. “Phil created and drove that.”   COVID changed investing for a lot of firms. Gone were the days of in-person meetings and everyone had to deal with days of Zoom-induced chaos. That’s when GoAhead decided to try to rethink its processes. “We wanted to figure out how to scale [our process] up most effectively. Now, we just have founders submit a video pitch through our platform. It literally takes about five minutes from start to finish; it’s a four-minute elevator pitch. They just fill out some basic information like their name and company name ahead of time. From the moment they submit that pitch, we let them know in three days or less if we want to invite them to a partner meeting or not,” explains Brady, revealing that the firm gets more than 3,000 pitches per year. The company still maintains its promise of a three-day turnaround. “If we invite them to a partner meeting, we give them a final decision the next day at five o’clock. So the entire process can be done in a week. You could submit a pitch on Monday and you could have money in the bank on Friday, feasibly.” “We get people a decision the following day, so we don’t have time to review what other firms are doing. We just state the amount of money we want to invest and the valuation cap we want to invest at.”
Clancey Stahr, managing partner, GoAhead Ventures On the face of it, it seems like a very founder-friendly way of deploying capital: Anyone can pitch and once they do, the process is transparent, quick and relatively streamlined. Most importantly, the fact that anyone can submit a pitch on its website means the firm presents a level playing field to potential investments. “We do deals anywhere in the world. We cover all sectors. We’re completely flexible and the only ‘gating factor’ is that we are only focused on the early stage. Aside from that, we are just choosing people, so we wanted to put all founders on equal footing. We felt that most other funds ended up only inviting founders to pitch if they have some kind of warm intro or some kind of strong pedigree in their background that kind of gets them in the front door,” said Brady. “We love to be able to watch all these pitch videos apples-to-apples to try to decide without other extrinsic factors. So far, it has been great. We launched it around COVID and it has really skyrocketed our deal flow in ways we couldn’t have imagined. I think it’s been kind of a win-win for founders and for us.” Picking a fight with warm introductions — replacing them with the hurdle of having to record a video — has given the firm an edge, it believes.   “There are a lot of really well-known firms. When you go to their website, it says something like ‘Find a partner for a warm introduction to the partnership.’ For us as emerging fund managers, the most frustrating thing about starting a VC fund is also fundraising. Everything about the process sucks. You need to find a warm intro to this billionaire. You need to find someone who knows someone who knows someone — the process is entirely unclear,” Stahr laments. “You meet someone, they say, ‘Oh, this sounds great,’ and then they disappear. I know that happens to founders all the time, too, and all the fine-tuning we’ve done to our process around the top of the funnel as well as making it transparent is mainly built around our frustration with fundraising for our own funds. We just hated that so we decided to change it.” The firm is explicitly not investing with a consensus-driven model: If one of the investors wants to write a check, they can, even if the others think it’s an awful idea.

505,"CEO of Orbex, a UK small launch developer, is stepping down",['@breadfrom'],"April 14, 2023","U.K.-based small launch developer Orbex is undergoing a change in leadership. The company’s co-founder and (now former) CEO Chris Larmour said on LinkedIn that he will no longer be leading the startup as it races to its first launch sometime this year. His LinkedIn post suggests that the departure was mutual: “I feel I have taken [Orbex] as far as I can personally, and it’s time now to step away and let others lead the company to the next level.” But there is no doubt that a major leader stepping away from a company at such a pivotal point in its development — in this case, just before the first test of its microlauncher, Prime — suggests a more uneasy exit. The news is all the more puzzling because Orbex had a slew of positive news announcements last year. In October, the company closed $45.8 million in Series C funding led by new investor the Scottish National Investment Bank, a vote of confidence from the government. The following month, Orbex said it had signed a lease with a Scottish developer to construct a launch site near Sutherland, in the northern part of Scotland. Kristian Von Bengtson, Orbex’s current Chief Development Officer, will act as interim CEO while the company looks for a new leader. “The company is now transitioning into its commercial phase as we move toward the first launch of the Orbex Prime vehicle,” an Orbex spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Following a sustained period of fundraising and extensive research and development over the past few years, it is now time for someone new to take the helm and lead the company through this important stage.” Orbex is one of the most well-funded rocket startups in Europe, having raised nearly £100 million ($124 million) since its founding in 2015. The company was only recently surpassed by German startup Isar Aerospace in March. The story has been updated to include comments from Orbex. "
506,Pinterest brings on Google Pixel VP to fill chief product officer position,['@laurenforristal'],"April 19, 2023","Pinterest announced today its newest hire, Sabrina Ellis, to take on the role of chief product offer. Ellis spent the last 12 years at Google, where she led the work on Google Pixel. Previously, she spent eight years at Yahoo (the parent company of TechCrunch) in numerous leadership roles. Sabrina will join Pinterest on May 15. She will replace Pinterest’s current senior vice president of product, Naveen Gavini, who will remain at the company until the end of September. In her new role, Ellis will lead the product management and design teams, reporting directly to Pinterest CEO Bill Ready. The overarching goal for the company is to make everything on Pinterest shoppable. For instance, in July 2022, Pinterest launched an API for Shopping, so merchants can create engaging shopping experiences for users (aka Pinners). It also rolled out a Shop tab, which features are now integrated throughout the Pinterest experience for businesses to show off all their shoppable products. During its latest earnings call, Ready mentioned that Pinterest is also working on making videos shoppable. Additionally, the company is currently testing ways of integrating Shuffles collage content into Pinterest, starting with shopping. Ellis will be responsible for helping accelerate this goal by further integrating Pinterest’s shopping experience into the home feed and the search function. In today’s announcement, the company reiterated plans to make pins shoppable.   “I’m thrilled to join the incredible team at Pinterest. In a world where finding inspiration is more important than ever, I’ve long admired how Pinterest stands out as the platform helping people turn real-life dreams into real-world action,” Ellis said in a statement. “I’ve been passionate throughout my career about offering users experiences that enhance their lives and foster positivity. Pinterest is a natural fit for me to pursue this passion, and I’m excited to create a world where inspiration and emotional well-being go so authentically hand-in-hand.” “I’m excited for Sabrina to steer the next phase of innovation at Pinterest while leading the most talented and hardworking individuals I’ve ever had the privilege to work with and learn from,” Gavini said. After more than 11 years, Gavini is stepping down in order to pursue the next chapter in his career, the company wrote. Gavini has worked on almost every major new product at Pinterest, including his time as an engineer for Guided Search, its search engine that launched in 2014 to give users an in-depth discovery experience with the use of descriptive guides. “When I joined Pinterest, I was motivated by the idea of building a first-of-its kind platform for people to discover inspiration for all aspects of their lives,” Gavini added. “More than a decade later, I’m grateful for the opportunity to have helped scale Pinterest to a place that inspires hundreds of millions of users around the world.” As of February, Pinterest has 450 million monthly active users worldwide.

507,Alaska Airlines does away with check-in kiosks,['@fredericl'],"April 18, 2023","Alaska Airlines recently started a three-year, $2.5 billion project to improve the airport experience at its hubs and focus cities like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a part of this project, the airline is looking to modernize the lobby experience — and as the company announced today, the most visible change here will be the removal of the good old check-in kiosk. Alaska will encourage fliers to check in at home or on their smartphones and instead of the kiosks, the airline will introduce single-function, iPad-based bag tag stations, where fliers can scan their boarding passes to get a bag tag, and automatic bag drops. These bag drops will also mark the first time Alaska will use biometric data to authenticate travelers. The airline started testing this system at a number of airports, including Palm Springs, in recent months, but it’s now announcing this wider rollout. Image Credits: Alaska Airlines Image Credits: Alaska Airlines Charu Jain, Alaska’s senior VP of merchandising and innovation, stressed that Alaska was the first airline to put kiosks in the airport lobby and that it now wants to be the first to remove them. The airline, she said, is always looking for ways to remove pain points and the lobby experience remains one of those, as travelers simply want to get through security and to their gate. “When we looked at what to do with that pain point, we started reimagining the lobby and looking at customer behavior and trends,” Jain said. “Everybody uses their mobile phone now. So we’re really kind of saying ‘goodbye to kiosks and hello smartphone’ and what that does is it creates a very easy way to connect and get through the lobby in five minutes or less.” Image Credits: Alaska Airlines Image Credits: Alaska Airlines She noted that today, across all of the airports that Alaska serves, about 70% of travelers check in before they arrive at the airport (and in some places, that number is significantly higher). The company wants to drive that number to 90%. The idea to get every flier through the lobby in five minutes is also ambitious. However, Jain argues that today, users have to enter their confirmation number in the kiosk and then maybe pay for baggage and also select seats — and then wait for the machine to print a boarding pass — all of which can take over five minutes. Now, at some of the stations that the company has started using this system, fliers take around 45 seconds to print a bag tag. Image Credits: Alaska Airlines Image Credits: Alaska Airlines It’s interesting that Alaska decided to go with a consumer-level iPad connected to a printer for the bag tagging experience, but Jain argues that this allows the company to quickly iterate on the experience. She noted that Alaska worked closely with Apple on this project. Alaska also already provides all of its agents with iOS devices. “What this does is it creates this iOS ecosystem where all that technology can talk to each other now,” she explained. “So we’re connecting the agents not just physically but also through technology with our guests. And a lot of our guests have Apple phones versus Android, too. It’s easy to change, too. Any change on the kiosk, you’d have to work with a vendor and that takes about six weeks. With these, we can roll out changes very quickly and it’s a very simple and good user experience.” Image Credits: Alaska Airlines Image Credits: Alaska Airlines The new automated bag drops will launch later, but once they become available, they’ll look quite similar to Delta’s new biometrics-based bag drops — and just like with Delta’s system, Alaska will also work with the TSA to enable biometric confirmation that it was really you who dropped off a bag (though you will also be able to scan your ID or work with an agent). It’s worth noting that Alaska is obviously aware that not everybody will be able to check in online. Agents will remain available for assistance, and Jain emphasized that travelers will continue to have this option.    "
508,Binance CFTC suit shows that ‘regulators will keep regulating and regulate more’,['@jacqmelinek'],"March 28, 2023","Another bomb has fallen on the crypto space — and the impact could be far-reaching On Monday, the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission announced it was suing Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume; its CEO, Changpeng Zhao; and chief compliance officer Samuel Lim. The company, Zhao and Lim are being sued for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules. “Crypto is under attack,” Yankun Guo, partner at Chicago-based law firm Ice Miller, told TechCrunch+. “The past six months has seen a wave of complaints and enforcement actions against blue-chip names including Coinbase, Kraken and KuCoin, and it was only a matter of time until Binance had their turn.” Binance had about $11 billion in trading volume in the past 24 hours and has over 90 million customers globally, according to CoinMarketCap data. It launched in June 2017, and within 180 days became the largest crypto exchange in the world. The exchange has never registered with the CFTC in any capacity and has “disregarded federal laws” for U.S. financial markets, including laws that implement controls to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorism financing, among other aspects, the filing said. TechCrunch+ reached out to CFTC for comment but did not hear back by the time of publication. A Binance spokesperson said the filing was “unexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years.” They added that they intend to continue to collaborate with regulators in the U.S. and around the world. “The best path forward is to protect our users and to collaborate with regulators to develop a clear, thoughtful regulatory regime.” Binance has spent $80 million on external partners like know-your-customer vendors, transaction monitoring, market surveillance and investigative tools to support its compliance programs, the spokesperson added. The ultimate impact on Binance could send shockwaves through the global digital asset market, Jason Allegrante, chief legal and compliance officer at Fireblocks, said. The lawsuit is also interesting because two executives, Zhao and Lim, were named, Guo noted. “This is a major shift that shows regulators are not only going after the company but also executives.”"
509,AirOps is helping companies build AI-enabled applications on top of LLMs,['@ron_miller'],"April 26, 2023","There is a shift in the air, and it feels like companies need to be thinking about how to put large language models to work, but as with any new advanced technology, it’s often easier said than done, especially for less-technical organizations. AirOps, an early-stage startup, is in the right place at the right time, helping companies take advantage of these new capabilities to build AI-enabled applications on top of large language models. Today, the company announced a $7 million seed round, which actually closed at the beginning of last year. Company CEO and co-founder Alex Halliday says that with the recent interest in LLMs, there is a challenge for businesses trying to get involved. “There is a really large gap to close between these amazing capabilities that folks can play with in things like ChatGPT, and then [applying that] to the kind of hardest challenges in the business. So we’re creating a platform that lets folks come in and create custom solutions on top of these algorithms that really move numbers in the business,” Halliday told TechCrunch. The company is currently helping customers build applications on top of three LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3 and Claude. The idea is to help users do things like automating processes, extracting insights from data, generating personalized content and performing natural language processing techniques, according to the company. Halliday says that current customers are looking for ways to take advantage of their own data and content in conjunction with LLMs to build new content from that existing corpus or build a generative AI experience on top of their existing software. One of the primary value propositions of the company is helping customers use these models more efficiently and effectively because it can get expensive. “What’s kind of really interesting is that you can actually use the larger models to train smaller models. So maybe for the first couple of months you would run using GPT-4, and that would create the training outputs to then use a smaller, open source model that’s been fine-tuned,” he said. And AirOps can help you move through those steps. “We’re really learning the right recipes and architectures here, but we expect over time the kind of boil-the-ocean, sledgehammer approach will give way to a more nuanced and a better understanding of how to take advantage of the menu of choices people have,” he said. The company launched last year with the goal of helping get value from their organizational data, but as LLMs moved into the public consciousness, the company shifted its focus. “As we started to look at the application of LLMs to the data space, we realized that actually a much larger opportunity was helping people blend LLMs with their data to create custom workflows and applications,” he said. Last fall they really shifted their focus to that approach. The company has 14 employees with a few open roles. Halliday says he sees diversity across many dimensions, but he is aiming to build a diverse employee base as he builds the company, and this is especially true given how new LLMs are. “We’ve really been very open-minded when hiring people with different backgrounds and different levels of experience,” he said. The $7 million seed investment was led by Wing VC with participation from Founder Collective, XFund, Village Global, Apollo Projects and Lachy Groom."

According to Carta, “the number of down rounds had nearly quadrupled in Q1 2023 compared to the same time last year,” writes Rebecca Szkutak. With valuations falling, founders who accept down rounds no longer have the taint of failure, said Russ Wilcox, a partner at Pillar VC. “When you set a $700 million valuation, it looks like you’re winning somehow and you’re not being diluted, but actually, you just raised the bar so high,” he said.

/ Getty Images My hot take on down rounds: when you consider the alternative, they’re just fine. Reasonable people can agree that startup valuations have been overvalued for years. I’m not an economist, but this seems more like a market correction than the start of a bleak winter. Even so, Alex Wilhelm reports that down rounds “accounted for nearly one-fifth of all venture investments Carta saw in the first quarter.” “I don’t see any reason for this trend to suddenly arrest, let alone reverse,” he writes.

That’s a year earlier than the Japanese automaker originally said it would introduce EVs based on its in-house vehicle platform, which puts greater emphasis on software and over-the-air updates à la Tesla. Honda said in a statement that the 2025 vehicle will feature a new, in-house operating system, which will “enable the continuous advancement of vehicle functions and services for customers even after the vehicle is purchased.”  A latecomer to the electric vehicle race in North America, so far Honda has leaned on GM to get its EVs out the door by building on the Detroit automaker’s Ultium architecture and EV platform. The EVs that Honda developed with GM — the Prologue and Acura ZDX — are due in North America in 2024. Honda said its first e:Architecture-based vehicle will be “a mid- to large-size EV model,” disappointing the seemingly precious few of us here in North America who prefer small cars. TechCrunch reached out to Honda to ask if it plans to introduce smaller electrics stateside, and a spokesperson for the company later declined to “speculate on other future products.”"
512,Stability AI CEO has the ambition to IPO in next few years,['@nmasc_'],"March 31, 2023","Emad Mostaque, the CEO and founder of open source platform Stability AI, hinted at plans to go public in the next few years, during the Cerebral Valley AI Conference in San Francisco on Thursday. He also shut down the idea that Stability AI, an OpenAI rival and leader in the generative artificial intelligence space, will ever get acquired. “I think you can’t just IPO,” Mostaque said during an interview with journalist Eric Newcomer. “You need to have amazing revenue, amazing margins, distribution, and so we’ve been executing…we’re 17 months old.” He also said that the business model of Stability AI’s open source platform will be seen more properly in the next year,” but added that he doesn’t “want to give away my arbitrage opportunities.” The generative intelligence company landed a spotlight after building Stable Diffusion, an image-generating system, along with Dance Diffusion and the development of open source music. Thus, it’s unsurprising that Mostaque feels strongly about creating open source standards in the world of generated art. Mostaque was one of the notable 1,100+ signatories who published an open letter this week asking for more regulation in the AI space, but more specifically, for “‘all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months.” His name appeared alongside Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris.   “OpenAI should become transparent and probably governed; what is the governance of Open AI? Nobody knows. What is transparent? Completely opaque,” Mostaque said during the panel, defending the petition, which some critics see as destructive or an attempt by some buidlers to slow down competition. The bullishness around exits, and pause on innovation, comes as Bloomberg reports swirl that Stability AI is seeking funding that would value the business at $4 billion, up from a reported $1 billion post-money valuation that it landed in October when it raised capital from Coatue and Lightspeed Venture partners. Mostaque didn’t comment on fundraising rumors. Earlier this month, Stability AI bought imaging tool Init ML.  Despite all the activity in the space, Mostaque doesn’t think AI is a bubble, saying that “this is bigger than 5G and self-driving customers.” “When founders come to me, I say build good products and solve problems…most of the stuff is still surface level,” he said.

513,Using Facebook in the EU? Here’s how to opt out of its creepy ads,['@riptari'],"April 4, 2023","Facebook and Instagram users in the European Union objecting to Meta’s behavioral advertising can easily ask for their data not to being used for its consentless tracking-and-profiling thanks to a free tool provided by privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb. According to noyb, an online form Meta is planning to offer EU users wanting to exercise their legal right to opt out of its ads processing is not at-all straightforward — no surprise there! — hence why the group has created a super-simple way for them to obtain their rights under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Users can lodge their objection via noyb’s tool either by logging into Facebook (i.e. to verify their account); or just by providing noyb with the email they use for the service; or objecting via their own own email client. Once they’ve confirmed they want noyb to help them opt out of Meta’s processing (i.e. by consenting to its data processing for this limited purpose), the tool generates an email on their behalf that noyb sends to Meta’s data protection officer asking for it to stop processing their data for ads. The GDPR states that individuals have an absolute right to object to the processing of their personal data if it is for direct marketing purposes — meaning there are no grounds for the request to be refused. There is also no required format for these objections to be lodged — so if Meta intends to comply with the GDPR it cannot ignore emails from users asking for it to stop processing their data. Here’s the link to the tool noyb has created for opting out.  You can also see a preview of the objection letter it sends to Meta on your behalf. The letter asks Meta for confirmation of compliance with the objection within five working days, and emphasizes that the user does not wish to be referred to “any links, online forms or other ways to exercise my rights” (a common delaying tactic used to frustrate individuals’ data protection rights), emphasizing: “I would have to treat such a reference as a refusal to comply with my clear request.” Per the GDPR, data processors must comply with a right to object “without undue delay” — or, typically, at the latest a month after receipt of a request. So Meta should be acting on any such opt-out requests that it receives stat. Or it’ll be risking fresh complaints and privacy enforcement. The European rights group was behind a successful challenge to the legal basis Meta has claimed for tracking and profiling users which led to the tech giant finally being hit with a $410 million penalty at the start of this year — along with an order to fix its violations of the GDPR within three months.   Meta is due to start applying a new privacy policy in the EU from tomorrow, following the aforementioned GDPR decision that found its claim of contractual necessity to be a bogus basis for behavioral advertising. And it has suggested it will apply some alternative form of ad targeting for users who opt out — such as contextual targeting, which does not rely on tracking and profiling individuals. The GDPR breach finding means Meta currently lacks a lawful basis for the processing under the bloc’s rules. Hence why it’s being forced to switch legal bases — and it is planning to claim a so-called “legitimate interest” (aka LI) to process people’s data for microtargeting under the incoming regional policy. This is its response to the three month deadline imposed by EU regulators to bring its ads processing into compliance with the GDPR. So essentially Meta was forced to do something.  Data protection experts suggest LI is (also) extremely unlikely to fly as a valid legal basis for Meta’s surveillance ads. But even to be able to claim it’s relying on this basis it needs to provide users with a way to opt out of the ads processing since the regulation demands it offer a right to object to LI-based processing. Which means this is already far more than the privacy-hostile tech giant has offered before. (tl;dr: Privacy enforcement works!) Thing is, this being Meta, the company doesn’t seem keen for EU users to exercise their legal right to object to its ads processing. noyb has provided a link to what it describes as “the hidden and complex Facebook opt-out form” which Meta appears to be planning to use to obfuscate this privacy choice from users. The form deploys classic dark pattern design (aka sludge) to bury the key choice, deploying a series of nested menus replete with irrelevant info, tedious drop-downs and other hidden options (i.e. which only appear if you select a specific choice), larded with reams more extraneous information that’s designed to steer users away from the salient right Meta does not want them to exercise. Eventually, after a lot of tedious clicking around trying to find the legally mandated objection option, TechCrunch arrived at vague wording stating: “I still have a question on how to exercise my privacy rights”. Clicking on this brought up yet another menu asking for country of residence — seemingly in order, finally, to be able to file a request. However — at the time of writing — the pre-populated list Facebook offered us did not feature any EU Member States. (We can only hope Meta will have fixed that by the time the new privacy policy goes into effect tomorrow. Or, er, it’s yet another dark pattern to try to circumvent EU rights — literally by preventing users from stating they reside in the region… 🤦) Either way, it’s a lot quicker and easier to use noyb’s tool to opt out of Meta’s privacy violating ads. (Here’s that link again.) You could also just manually send an email to Meta asking for it to stop processing any of your personal data — “for alleged ‘Legitimate Interests'”  — assuming you can find an email address for Meta’s DPO (data protection officer) buried somewhere on their website. The standard EU privacy experts suggest Meta should be providing is to ask users for up front consent to ads processing. And complaints over its attempt to ram a surveillance ads business through an LI basis will surely fast follow its latest legal ground switcheroo. But, in the meanwhile, EU users can at least ask Meta for their opt out. Commenting in a statement, noyb’s founder and chair, Max Schrems, said: “These moves by Facebook are just laughable and embarrassing. You have to find each element in their privacy policy that you disagree with and explain why Meta’s assessment is wrong in your individual case. Their assessment, however, is not published. It’s not far from saying you can only opt-out ever second Monday from 8am to 9am.” “Our form turns the table: Meta has to argue why they have an overriding interest — not the user,” he added. “Users can now opt out of data processing, and Facebook must process this objection without delay. We want to make it as easy as possible for those affected to exercise their fundamental rights.” Any Facebook users in the US wishing they had such a choice should get on the phone to their representatives in Congress and tell them to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation ASAP.

514,Fintech-focused VC firm Anthemis Group lays off 28% of staff as part of restructuring,['@bayareawriter'],"April 25, 2023","Anthemis Group has completed restructuring that resulted in its letting go of 16 employees, or about 28% of its employees, earlier this year, the fintech-focused venture firm has confirmed to TechCrunch. A spokesperson for London-based Anthemis said the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.” The firm declined to say which roles were impacted in the restructuring but a source who wished to remain anonymous pointed to Farhan Lalji, a former managing director of the firm, as being among the group that was laid off, in addition to early-stage investor Swarnali Mitra and an individual who served as both a content and editorial manager. TechCrunch reached out to all three employees but did not receive a response. However, their LinkedIn profiles indicate they are no longer with Anthemis as of January and February of this year. (Reporter’s note: It was called to our attention post-publication that former managing director Farhan Lalji confirmed in this February 1 blog post that he left Anthemis and then reveals he founded another venture firm, LTV Capital, in this February 2 post.) Since the layoffs, Anthemis says it has made two new hires — an investment principal and head of intellectual capital — and currently has a team of 44 people across Europe and North America. In April 2021, Jillian Williams left her role as investment principal at Anthemis to join Cowboy Ventures as a partner. She initially joined Anthemis in July 2016 and helped open its U.S. office in New York. Founded in 2010, Anthemis today has $1.5 billion in assets under management. The firm in late 2021 announced that it had raised $700 million in new funds in what the spokesperson described as “a collection of capital” it closed “across strategies” from its venture studio through to its venture growth fund. “Our focus, now more than ever, is around deploying financial, intellectual and human capital in service of the financial system improvement and reinvention,” the spokesperson said this month. “And I will say that strategy continues to evolve.” She said Anthemis remains committed to backing diverse founders and that it continues to “explore complementary products” within its asset management business. This isn’t the first time in recent years that a venture capital firm has let go of staff. Last June, Backstage Capital revealed it had downsized its staff from 12 to three people after pausing net new investments. Generally, though, it is quite unusual for a venture firm to lay off so many people at one time.  Anthemis declined to provide further specifics around its strategy moving forward, instead pointing me to this blog post from co-founder Amy Nauiokas. In the post, Nauiokas writes that the firm aims to “translate 2022’s reckoning in private markets into enduring change in the structure and method of early-stage investing.”  She added: “With interest rates rising across western economies, the ‘search for yield’ that has sustained an epoch of our business has officially come to a close.”  So far this year, Anthemis has publicly announced a few new investments including: Flyby, Elevate (lead investor), Greenspark and Agreena. It also announced a follow-on investment in Flock. The firm has also seen a couple of exits, including Power being acquired by Marqeta and Goji getting picked up by Euroclear. Other companies in its portfolio include social investment app eToro, investing and savings app Betterment and insurtech Vouch. But in the past year, Anthemis has also seen a couple of portfolio companies stumble. In November, controversy surrounding the sudden stepping down of three of Pipe’s co-founders, including its CEO, raised eyebrows. And more recently, LGBTQ+-focused digital bank Daylight was slammed with a lawsuit by three former employees “alleging age and wage discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, and fraud.” Meanwhile, Anthemis also is “actively fundraising,” the spokesperson confirmed, but said the firm could not comment on those efforts beyond that so as not to violate regulatory rules. It also declined to provide a comment in response to an allegation from one affected employee that the recent layoffs were related to challenges in getting capital commitments “due to less than top quartile returns.” The spokesperson said Anthemis could not comment on returns “as a matter of policy.” One individual who wished to remain anonymous confirmed to TechCrunch that she was notified about one week before she was due to start a new position at the firm in January that the firm had “restructured” and that the role she was set to start “no longer exists.” However, she says she was “really OK with the way it was dealt with and how I was treated.” The company’s restructuring is not the first time there has been a management shakeup. The firm also made headlines in 2018 when its then-CEO and co-founder Nadeem Shaikh resigned after reportedly being the target of a sexual harassment complaint by a female employee.

515,Snap is offering its AR tools to enterprise customers,['@indianidle'],"March 23, 2023","Snap users are already quite familiar with the company’s expertise in AR thanks to Lenses and Filters. Now, the social media company is unveiling AR Enterprise Services (ARES) to offer those tools to businesses. As part of the launch, Snap is offering a “Shopping Suite” to brands that can help them get more customers. The company said that more than 250 million people engage with AR on the platform every day. For comparison, Snapchat has 375 million daily active users. Last year, it claimed that since January 2021 users have tried shopping-related AR lenses more than 5 billion times. The company didn’t provide an updated figure. The company’s partners use AR Lenses to let people try on different apparel and accessories. They include Amazon and Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart. Snap’s new Shopping Suite SaaS product offers four features: AR try-on to virtually try new styles of clothing, footwear and accessories (users can also upload an image of themselves and see how these items might look on them); 3D viewer to look at a product from all angles; fit and sizing recommendation tech based on the users’ body shapes; and enterprise manager to host and manage all digital assets, create AR experiences using Snap’s SDK and look at performance analytics… as well as help from the Snap’s team to customize client’s solutions. Companies can integrate these features directly into their apps or websites, so customers can engage with them while checking out products. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap The social media platform has been building up to this for a while. In 2021, it acquired Fit Analytics, a startup that helped customers find the right size of apparel and footwear from online retailers. The same year, it added commerce-related features to its AR Lens creator studio. In April 2022, Snap introduced tools for virtual try-on and converting images into 3D assets. These were made possible by Snap’s acquisitions of Forma and Vertebrae. It also launched the Lens Cloud back-end service for lens developers. Now, the company is combining all this into a package for enterprise customers. “Over the last decade, we’ve been hard at work bringing fun and personal AR experiences to Snapchatters. In the next decade, we’re excited to take our world-class AR technology to business’ websites and apps. We look forward to making the shopping experience more delightful for consumers and transforming businesses around the world with AR Enterprise Services,” Jill Popelka, head of AR Enterprise Services at Snap, said in a statement. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap Snap has been testing the SaaS offering with some customers already. These include sunglasses seller Goodr, clothing company Princess Polly and Mongolian manufacturer Gobi Cashmere. Snap claimed these retailers have seen higher conversion rates, better engagement with products and lower return rates. The company’s results for Q4 2022 showed that revenue was flat year-over-year and it registered a net loss as compared to a profitable quarter in Q4 2021. The company has been taking steps to return to a cash flow-positive state with different monetization strategies. Last June, it launched the Snapchat+ subscription plan, which now has more than 2 million paid users. Snap is buoyant about its enterprise offerings. The company quoted a survey saying 92% of Gen Z users are comfortable using AR shopping features. A combined study from Publics media and Snap suggests that the AR Retail market will have a project value of $1.2 trillion by 2030."
516,HeatTransformers turns up the dial on heat pumps with new funding,['@Haje'],"April 6, 2023","In the Netherlands, central heating boilers will be banned by 2026 and its government has incentivized the installation of heat pumps. Meanwhile, the U.K. government estimates that heating buildings accounts for 25% of the U.K.’s greenhouse gas emissions. It passed the Energy Security Bill, and is aiming to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028. All of this opens up opportunities for companies advising on, fitting and maintaining heat pumps, which is what Netherlands-based HeatTransformers, does. It just a raised €15 million Series A to go heavy on the (proverbial) gas. “Heat pumps have an unbeatable CO2 reduction ratio per invested dollars for households,” says Stijn Otten, co-founder and director of HeatTransformers, “This ratio is much higher than with solar for instance. This was already the case back in 2018 when we started, but even more today.”   While heat pumps might not be new technology, the tech isn’t evenly distributed. More than 60% of homes in Norway are heated using heat pumps, for example, while the U.S. sees fewer than 6% so equipped. HeatTransformers seeks to address the traditional challenges of heat pump adoption by connecting heat pump producers and installation specialists with consumers. The HeatTransformers platform takes consumers through the process from the beginning, when they might only be thinking about the benefits of a heat pump, through installation and beyond, with maintenance, online monitoring and the optimization of heat pumps. This is a model that has attracted global energy companies, heat pump producers and installers as committed partners, including Engie, Bosch, BDR Thermea Group and dozens of local and national installers. Its €15 million Series A funding round was led by Energy Impact Partners (“EIP”), a global investment firm supporting the transition to a sustainable future, with participation from existing investors Fair Capital Partners and InnovationQuarter. Interestingly, HeatTransformers told TechCrunch that it could have done without the investment but felt that it needed to scale faster in order to address the general state of the global energy market: war in Ukraine, energy poverty and carbon emissions’ climate impact. “In this process we were looking for truly professional investors who could help us scaling up across multiple markets,” says Otten. “But at the same time, we also wanted investors who share the same impact fundamentals we have. This is what we found in Energy Impact Partners — a leading investment firm in this space with experience scaling companies like us across multiple markets.”   With heat pump sales having risen by almost 38% across Europe last year, which replaced roughly 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas and avoided 8 million tons of CO2 emissions, HeatTransformers has recognized that right now is the time to be expanding, to meet the growing need for heat pumps not just in the Netherlands, but across Europe. “This investment will cement our market-leading position in the Netherlands, it will enable us to grow into other markets like Germany and the U.K.,” says Otten. “Fundamentally, it will help us grow and increase our impact.” For Otten himself, the excitement lies in growing his company and, further into the future, having a lasting impact on global residential heating, as well as climate change. “I am specifically looking forward to building the teams, further developing the tech-platform and building our partnerships with suppliers, energy companies and installation companies across Europe,” says Otten. “In 10 years’ time, heat pumps will be the common way of heating your home across the entire globe. HeatTransformers will have played a pivotal role in speeding up this transition and [will still be] playing a role in the installation of heat pumps and optimizing the energy systems of households across multiple countries.”"
517,Germany probes Microsoft’s market power,['@riptari'],"March 28, 2023","Microsoft is the latest tech giant to be caught in the cross-hairs of Germany’s antitrust authority. The Federal Cartel Office (FCO), aka the Bundeskartellamt, has announced it’s opened a proceeding to determine whether special abuse measures can be applied to the company’s business in Germany — citing Microsoft’s extensive digital ecosystem which it noted cuts across multiple markets, including operating systems and office software; cloud computing; gaming; professional networking; Internet search; and — latterly — novel AI applications. Commenting in a statement, Andreas Mundt, president of the FCO, said: With Windows and its Office products Microsoft has had a long-standing and very strong position with regard to operating systems and office software. Based on this, the company has continuously expanded its product range both for business customers and consumers. More recently, we have seen a strong increase in the importance of the cloud services Azure and OneDrive, which are often linked to other Microsoft applications, and the resounding success of Teams, a software for video conferences and collaborative working. In addition, Microsoft is also active in other areas, including gaming with its Xbox, career networks with its service LinkedIn or internet searching with its search engine Bing. Most recently, the company has attracted attention with the integration of AI applications. In light of this, there are good reasons to examine whether Microsoft is of paramount significance for competition across markets. Such a finding would allow us to take action at an early stage and prohibit possible anti-competitive practices. Earlier FCO reviews of Google, Meta and Amazon already confirmed the special abuse control regime applies to their businesses (although Amazon is appealing) — dialling up the regulator’s ability to act against anti-competitive behavior by drawing on updated powers which are designed to target digital giants with so-called “paramount significance for competition across markets”. Back in June 2021, the FCO also announced a proceeding to review Apple’s market power — which it noted today is “well advanced”. But it did not confirm when it would take a decision on Cupertino. The German regime offers a taster of what’s coming down the pipe across the European Union as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) comes into application later this year. That said, the EU’s ex ante competition regime takes a slightly different tack, laying out a set of up-front ‘dos and don’ts’ for platforms that are designated as so-called “gatekeepers”, whereas the FCO has more leeway to decide what strictures to apply to tech giants that meet the local bar of having “paramount significance” for competition in Germany across digital markets. The FCO is also more advanced along this road of a more proactive approach to regulating digital giants, with the update to the German competition regime applied at the start of 2021; and now, a couple of years later, a clutch of designations in place — as well as some notable policy swerves to show for it: Such as Google offering not to put News Showcase results into search; and Meta untying its VR headsets from its social accounts. So while the EU will still be classifying gatekeepers (up to September) this year, with the DMA then allowing until March 2024 for compliance, the FCO has done a bunch of that foundational legwork already — and, in several cases, is empowered to intervene if it suspects anti-competitive by tech giants, cutting the time it can act on Big Tech competition concerns. In the case of Microsoft, the FCO emphasized that today’s proceeding does not “yet” mean it’s taking formal steps to assess specific practices the company is engaged in. However its press release offers a clear warning, writing: “If complaints or other information suggest that there are indications of Microsoft engaging in potentially anti-competitive practices, a separate decision will have to be issued in this matter — also in consultation with the European Commission and possibly other competition authorities.” A report in Bloomberg earlier this week suggested Microsoft has been seeking to apply data restrictions on users of its search index to prevent them developing their own AI chatbots — apparently to try to ensure OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology, which the tech giant is a major investor in, retains the lead in the generative AI race (and therefore that Microsoft also remains ahead of the pack, with even other giants like Google scrambling to keep up). While Microsoft was regularly in the cross hairs of antitrust regulators back in the nineties up to the early noughties, it has enjoyed something of a lighter touch on the competition scrutiny front over the last decade or so — during which time it’s steadily expanded and deepened its business across multiple digital markets, including healthcare, digital advertising and gaming, to name a few. Most recently, as noted above, it’s been close to the center of the buzz around so-called AI search — through its investment in (and partnership with) OpenAI, a former not-for-profit turned capped-profit AI developer, whose technology underpins the ‘new Bing‘. So reports that Microsoft is trying to throw its weight about to try to quash rivals’ ability to develop their own AI models could certainly trigger competition concerns. Microsoft was contacted for comment on the Bundeskartellamt’s proceeding. A company spokesperson sent us this statement: As a major technology company, we are mindful of our heightened responsibility to support a healthy competitive environment. We will engage constructively with the Bundeskartellamt as they seek to understand our role in digital markets.    "
518,Linux Foundation launches new organization to maintain TLA+,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 21, 2023","The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit tech consortium that manages various open source efforts, today announced the launch of the TLA+ Foundation to promote the adoption and development of the TLA+ programming language. AWS, Oracle and Microsoft are among the inaugural members.  What is the TLA+ programming language, you ask? It’s a formal “spec” language developed by computer scientist and mathematician Leslie Lamport. Best known for his seminal work in distributed systems, Lamport — now a scientist at Microsoft Research — created TLA+ to design, model, document and verify software programs — particularly those of the concurrent and distributed variety. To give a few examples, ElasticSearch, the organization behind the search engine of the same name, used TLA+ to verify the correctness of their distributed systems algorithms. Elsewhere, Thales, the electrical systems manufacturing firm, used TLA+ to model and develop fault-tolerant modules for its industrial control platform. “TLA+ is unique in that it’s intended for specifying a system, rather than for implementing software,” a Linux Foundation spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “Based on mathematical concepts, notably set theory and temporal logic, TLA+ allows for the expression of a system’s desired correctness properties in a formal and rigorous manner.” TLA+ includes a model checker and theorem prover to verify if a system’s specification satisfies its desired properties. The goal is to assist developers with reasoning about systems above the code level, uncovering and preventing design flaws (hopefully) before they evolve into bugs during the later stages of software engineering.  To that last point, failures in software design are surprisingly common — and disruptive. A 2020 report from the Standish Group found that around 66% of software projects fail. And according to the Consortium for Information and Software Quality, poor software quality cost companies over $2 trillion in 2020. With the establishment of the TLA+ Foundation, the Linux Foundation says it’ll provide education and training resources around TLA+, fund research and develop tools for it and work to foster a community of TLA+ practitioners. The TLA+ Foundation will also make decisions on language enhancements, address user feedback and guide the language’s evolution. “TLA+ has already been successfully used by major tech companies like Amazon, Oracle, and Microsoft to verify and design planetary-scale systems,” the spokesperson continued. “By establishing a TLA+ Foundation under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, TLA+ will gain increased visibility and support, promoting its wider adoption within the tech industry. The foundation’s mission to advocate for open-source projects will ensure that TLA+ continues to evolve and remain accessible to the broader tech community. Additionally, the foundation will facilitate greater collaboration between industry and academia, advancing the state of the art in formal methods and concurrent and distributed systems research.”"
519,Carbon’s laser weeding robots score another $30M,['@bheater'],"April 11, 2023","If I’m an investor hoping to determine where robotics goes next after logistics, I’m looking at three key categories: construction, healthcare and agriculture. All are still in their relative infancy and poised for (in my humble opinion) some explosive growth. Agtech robotics is going to be an especially interesting category over the next couple of years, given how loudly and aggressively John Deere has entered the category with a startup shopping spree. Also, much like fulfillment and logistics, farms have their own unique set of labor issues at the moment. The average age of an American farmer is mid-50s, and the life of a migrant worker is a difficult one, with numerous health and safety risks. Carbon Robotics, which first crossed our radar back in April 2021, is one of several firms competing for a place on the farm. The company has found some early success for its laser weeding robots with zapping “500 million weeds across 40 different crops,” per its press material. The company is on track to deliver LaserWeeder to 17 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces in 2023. This morning the Seattle-based firm announced a $30 million Series C. That follows a 2021 B round of $27 million, bringing its total to-date raise up to $67 million. Sozo Ventures led the round, which also features Anthos Capital, Fuse Venture Capital, Ignition Partners, Liquid 2 and Voyager Capital. “This financing round further supports our mission to provide cost-effective and efficient precision ag-tech tools to growers,” founder and CEO Paul Mikesell said of the latest round. “Traditional weeding methods, including hand weeding and herbicides, are expensive, unreliable and damage soil health. The LaserWeeder uniquely addresses all of these challenges.” The money will go toward sales, accelerating manufacturing and international expansion. It also sees investors from Sozo and Voyager joining Carbon’s board."
520,Germany’s XaaS platform Equipme secures $3.8M seed led by La Famiglia VC,['@mikebutcher'],"April 17, 2023","As the economy has gotten tougher, plenty of companies have switched from buying in assets to renting them. There’s a tortuous acronym for this which is XaaS or “everything as a service,” also referred to as “Servitization.” An example of this would be ServiceNow, which automates services for enterprise operations. A new-ish player in this space is Equipme, out of Germany, which bills itself in this XaaS manner. It’s now secured $3.8 million in a seed investment round led by La Famiglia VC, out of Berlin, the €250 million fund raise for which we covered just last month. Other investors include Lightbird, Anamcara and angels including Ignaz Forstmeier, co-founder at Personio, and Charlie Songhurst, former head of Corporate Strategy at Microsoft. Equipme has a B2B marketplace and asset management portal which — it says — enables suppliers to offer their products and services in this XaaS manner. In other words, companies invite their existing service-providers onto it and then make their services available via this self-service model. In a statement, Paul Martin, co-founder and CEO of Equipme, said: “For instance, Equipme simplifies the process of equipping employees during the onboarding process, by seamlessly integrating all relevant parties and suppliers, including the employees itself to select their preferred devices and tools. Subsequently, Equipme takes care of managing inventory, subscriptions, and related costs throughout the entire lifecycle in one central place.” Equipme says it is in use by 500 customers, largely in the DACH region, but plans to expand globally. The company was founded in November 2021 by Alexandre Seifert and Paul Martin, with its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Judith Dada, partner at La Famiglia added: “Decision-makers value cost efficiency and flexibility most. This is why Software as a Service has been so successful in recent years.”"
521,How to make progress on managing unstructured data,[],,"Long-time Forrester analyst and Elastic CIO discuss strategies for realizing value from data with search-powered technology   We asked a longtime CIO and a leading analyst whether organizations today are getting results that matter from all of their data, and the conversation was illuminating.  Less than 20% of enterprise data is finding its way into applications that provide actionable insights for businesses, estimates guest Boris Evelson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. There are “a lot of opportunities for all of us,” he said.  A recent study of technology leaders, conducted by Forrester Consulting and commissioned by Elastic, found that managing unstructured data was the top challenge respondents are trying to address with search-powered technology today. Evelson and Matthew Minetola, a CIO for 20+ years, now at Elastic, recommended three strategies to make progress in addressing this challenge. By applying search-powered technology to unify, visualize, and scale data, organizations can start to tap into that data opportunity. For 77% of survey respondents, information silos prevent them from using data to accelerate business growth. Organizations with structured data in data warehouses and unstructured data in data lakes may require different tools for analyzing and managing data. Search-powered technology can offer a unifying layer that brings structured and unstructured data together. “As the CIO, your job is to be able to provide the information a business needs in order to make decisions,” Minetola said. “The ability to now see into that 80% of the data and make decisions based off that . . . is significant.” Unifying data can help accelerate digital transformation — an objective for which 84% of organizations say they rely on search-powered technology. When thinking about all the data sources an organization needs to grapple with as part of its transformation, it makes sense. For instance, consider a bank with thousands of computer systems in over a hundred countries.  “You need technologies that close silos,” Evelson said. “Whenever we talk about digital transformation, data and analytics platforms that unify everything that I just talked about, like search-powered technologies, are at the top of everyone’s mind.” Search-powered technology should bring two critical capabilities to the table: a visualization layer and machine learning. Visualization improves the ability to extract insights from large volumes of data. “It’s one thing to be able to have data,” Minetola said. “It’s another thing to understand it.” Furthermore, machine learning such as natural language processing or vector search can help join data sources to create more relevance and context.  Together, these capabilities can help organizations be more adaptive and responsive in real time, as opposed to predefining database queries upfront and relying on historical views. Minetola describes the change as progressing from looking at data “in the rearview mirror to looking at it through the front windshield.” “Without the ability to link that data, to see that data, and understand it in real time and action it and be able to make insights and create relevance, I don’t know how in today’s world, let alone tomorrow’s world, a company is going to be able to survive,” Minetola said. Cloud, as Minetola said, enables “the ability to scale up . . . and not worry about where a limit is” when it comes to storing and managing data. When asked which features are most important to the success of their next search-powered solution, 85% of respondents named high storage capacity and a cloud-based platform.  McKinsey identifies the potential value of innovation driven by cloud computing at $770 billion,* including faster product development and hyper-scalability. Imagine being able to see telemetry data on what people are doing on a website, then tying that to product data, and then being able to see product utilization over time. By massively scaling with search-powered technology on the cloud, there are ways to better understand patterns of behavior and apply those insights to product innovation. Using search-powered technology to grasp the 80% of data just beyond our fingertips can help organizations be more insights-driven. Evelson explained that being an insights-driven business goes even further than being data-driven.  A data-driven business transforms data into metrics and indicators. An insights-driven business makes decisions based on those indicators. For 83% of organizations, search-powered technology delivers important insights that improve the speed of decision-making. From those decisions stem actions. “And then, hopefully,” Evelson said, “those actions are affecting tangible business outcomes.” Download the study to learn more about how search-powered technology is enabling the digital future of business.   *Cloudy with a chance of billions, 2022.

522,Crypto wallet company Ledger raises another $108 million,['@romaindillet'],"March 30, 2023","French startup Ledger has added more money to its Series C funding round. The company designs and manufactures so-called hardware wallets to secure crypto assets. In 2021, the company raised €356 million ($385 million at today’s exchange rate). And the company is adding another €100 million ($108 million) in new funding. This is an extension round as the valuation of the company isn’t changing — €1.3 billion ($1.41 billion at today’s exchange rate). In the current funding environment, raising at the same valuation is already quite impressive. Once again, the company has managed to line up a long list of investors. New investors in the company include True Global Ventures, Digital Finance Group and VaynerFund. Some existing investors are also investing in Ledger once again, such as 10T, Cité Gestion Private Bank, Cap Horn, Morgan Creek, Cathay Innovation, Korelya Capital and Molten Ventures. Ledger’s main products are hardware crypto wallets that offer a high level of security. The company’s current devices are shaped like USB keys and feature a tiny screen to confirm transactions on the device. Hardware wallets are secure by design because the private key of the crypto wallet never leaves the device — it is stored in a certified secure chip. When you want to send some crypto tokens, you have to use another device like a computer or a smartphone. When you enter the public address of the recipient in the Ledger Live app, you have to validate the transaction with the private key. That’s why you need to turn on your Ledger wallet and confirm the transaction. When you first boot up your Ledger device, the company asks you to write down a 24-word recovery phrase on a piece of paper. You should then store this recovery phrase in a safe place as it allows you (or someone else) to recover your wallet in case you lose your Ledger wallet. And it’s true that having a secure wallet doesn’t prevent scams. In July 2020, Ledger discovered a data breach of personal information stored in an e-commerce and marketing database. It led to phishing campaigns with scammers trying to obtain recovery phrases. To be fair, other wallets have been targeted by similar phishing campaigns. For instance, MetaMask users should never share their wallet seed phrase for the same reason. Some companies are moving away from this single point of failure by switching to other recovery methods, such as Argent and ZenGo. Ledger’s flagship product is the Ledger Nano S Plus. It’s the most recent iteration of the Ledger Nano S. It has a small black-and-white display, two buttons and a USB-C port to plug the device to your computer and turn it on. It costs $79. Ledger also sells the Ledger Nano X. It looks a lot like the Ledger Nano S Plus, but it has a built-in battery and a Bluetooth chip. This way, users can connect a Ledger Nano X to a smartphone using Bluetooth. Image Credits: Ledger

(opens in a new window) More recently, the company unveiled the Ledger Stax. Designed in partnership with Tony Fadell, this high-end wallet costs $279 and features a large E Ink display similar to a Kindle display. Just like other Ledger wallets, you can use it to sign transactions. But users will also be able to manage NFT collections. The display wraps around the body of the device, which means that the name of the wallet remains visible even if you stack Ledger wallets — crypto millionaires often have multiple Ledger devices to separate assets across several wallets. As it’s an E Ink display, the name of the wallet remains visible even when the device is turned off or the battery is empty. The company expects to ship the first Ledger Stax devices to its customers at some point in the next two months. Ledger has sold 6 million devices since its inception in 2014. And that trend isn’t slowing down as the FTX debacle showed once again that your crypto assets could disappear overnight if you leave them on a crypto exchange. The company sold 1 million devices between June 2022 and February 2023. In addition to this hardware business that is performing really well, the company offers enterprise solutions to secure crypto assets with governance and treasury management features. The enterprise platform also offers some DeFi and NFT management features. Ledger also generates revenue from Ledger Live. The company offers staking opportunities and integration with third-party products. But the company’s main products remain its hardware wallets as Ledger estimates that it secures 20% of cryptocurrencies and 30% of NFTs worldwide. Image Credits: Ledger

523,"With Bedrock, Amazon enters the generative AI race",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 13, 2023","Amazon is throwing its hat into the generative AI ring. But rather than build AI models entirely by itself, it’s recruiting third parties to host models on AWS. AWS today unveiled Amazon Bedrock, which provides a way to build generative AI-powered apps via pretrained models from startups including AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Stability AI. Available in a “limited preview,” Bedrock also offers access to Titan FMs (foundation models), a family of models trained in-house by AWS. “Applying machine learning to the real world — solving real business problems at scale — is what we do best,” Vasi Philomin, VP of generative AI at AWS, told TechCrunch in a phone interview. “We think every application out there can be reimagined with generative AI.” The debut of Bedrock was somewhat telegraphed by AWS’ recently inked partnerships with generative AI startups in the past few months, in addition to its growing investments in the tech required to build generative AI apps. Last November, Stability AI selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider, and in March, Hugging Face and AWS collaborated to bring the former’s text-generating models onto the AWS platform. More recently, AWS launched a generative AI accelerator for startups and said it would work with Nvidia to build “next-generation” infrastructure for training AI models. Bedrock is Amazon’s most forceful play yet for the generative AI market, which could be worth close to $110 billion by 2030, according to estimates from Grand View Research. With Bedrock, AWS customers can opt to tap into AI models from a variety of different providers, including AWS, via an API. The details are a bit murky — Amazon hasn’t announced formal pricing, for one. But the company did emphasize that Bedrock is aimed at large customers building “enterprise-scale” AI apps, differentiating it from some of the AI model hosting services out there, like Replicate (plus the incumbent rivals Google Cloud and Azure). One presumes that generative AI model vendors were incentivized by AWS’ reach or potential revenue sharing to join Bedrock. Amazon didn’t reveal terms of the model licensing or hosting agreements, however. The third-party models hosted on Bedrock include AI21 Labs’ Jurassic-2 family, which are multilingual and can generate text in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch. Claude, Anthropic’s model on Bedrock, can perform a range of conversational and text-processing tasks. Meanwhile, Stability AI’s suite of text-to-image Bedrock-hosted models, including Stable Diffusion, can generate images, art, logos and graphic designs. Image Credits: Amazon Image Credits: Amazon As for Amazon’s bespoke offerings, the Titan FM family comprises two models at present, with presumably more to come in the future: a text-generating model and an embedding model. The text-generating model, akin to OpenAI’s GPT-4 (but not necessarily on a par performance-wise), can perform tasks like writing blog posts and emails, summarizing documents and extracting information from databases. The embedding model translates text inputs like words and phrases into numerical representations, known as embeddings, that contain the semantic meaning of the text. Philomin claims it’s similar to one of the models that powers searches on Amazon.com. AWS customers can customize any Bedrock model by pointing the service at a few labeled examples in Amazon S3, Amazon’s cloud storage plan — as few as 20 is enough. No customer data is used to train the underlying models, Amazon says. “At AWS … we’ve played a key role in democratizing machine learning and making it accessible to anyone who wants to use it,” Philomin said. “Amazon Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models.” Of course, given the unanswered legal questions surrounding generative AI, one wonders exactly how many customers will bite. Microsoft has seen success with its generative AI model suite, Azure OpenAI Service, which bundles OpenAI models with additional features geared toward enterprise customers. As of March, over 1,000 customers were using Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft said in a blog post. But there are several lawsuits pending over generative AI tech from companies including OpenAI and Stability AI, brought by plaintiffs who allege that copyrighted data, mostly art, was used without permission to train the generative models. (Generative AI models “learn” to create art, code and more by “training” on sample images and text, usually scraped indiscriminately from the web.) Another case making its way through the courts seeks to establish whether code-generating models that don’t give attribution or credit can in fact be commercialized, and an Australian mayor has threatened a defamation suit against OpenAI for inaccuracies spouted by its generative model ChatGPT. Philomin didn’t instill much confidence, frankly, refusing to say which data exactly Amazon’s Titan FM family was trained on. Instead, he stressed that the Titan models were built to detect and remove “harmful” content in the data AWS customers provide for customization, reject “inappropriate” content users input and filter outputs containing hate speech, profanity and violence. Of course, even the best filtering systems can be circumvented, as demonstrated by ChatGPT. So-called prompt injection attacks against ChatGPT and similar models have been used to write malware, identify exploits in open source code and generate abhorrently sexist, racist and misinformational content. (Generative AI models tend to amplify biases in training data, or — if they run out of relevant training data — simply make things up.) But Philomin brushed aside those concerns. “We’re committed to the responsible use of these technologies,” he said. “We’re monitoring the regulatory landscape out there… we have a lot of lawyers helping us look at which data we can use and which we can’t use.” Philomin’s attempts at assurance aside, brands might not want to be on the hook for all that could go wrong. (In the event of a lawsuit, it’s not entirely clear whether AWS customers, AWS itself or the offending model’s creator would be held liable.) But individual customers might — particularly if there’s no charge for the privilege. On the subject and coinciding with its big generative AI push today, Amazon made CodeWhisperer, its AI-powered code-generating service, free of charge to developers without any usage restrictions. The move suggests that CodeWhisperer hasn’t seen the uptake Amazon hoped it would. Its chief rival, GitHub’s Copilot, had over a million users as of January, thousands of which are enterprise customers. CodeWhisperer has ground to make up, surely — which it aims to do on the corporate side with the simultaneous launch of CodeWhisperer Professional Tier. CodeWhisperer Professional Tier adds single sign-on with AWS Identity and Access Management integration as well as higher limits on scanning for security vulnerabilities. CodeWhisperer launched in late June as part of the AWS IDE Toolkit and AWS Toolkit IDE extensions as a response, of sorts, to the aforementioned Copilot. Trained on billions of lines of publicly available open source code and Amazon’s own codebase, as well as documentation and code on public forums, CodeWhisperer can autocomplete entire functions in languages like Java, JavaScript and Python based on only a comment or a few keystrokes. Image Credits: Amazon Image Credits: Amazon CodeWhisperer now supports several additional programming languages — specifically Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell scripting, SQL and Scala — and, as before, highlights and optionally filters the license associated with functions it suggests that bear a resemblance to existing snippets found in its training data. The highlighting is an attempt to ward off the legal challenges GitHub’s facing with Copilot. Time will tell whether it’s successful. “Developers can become a lot more productive with these tools,” Philomin said. “It’s difficult for developers to be up to date on everything… tools like this help them not have to worry about it.” In less controversial territory, Amazon announced today that it’s launching Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) Inf2 instances in general availability, powered by the company’s AWS Inferentia2 chips, which were previewed last year at Amazon’s re:Invent conference. Inf2 instances are designed to speed up AI runtimes, delivering ostensibly better throughput and lower latency for improved overall inference price performance. In addition, Amazon EC2 Trn1n instances powered by AWS Trainium, Amazon’s custom-designed chip for AI training, is also generally available to customers as of today, Amazon announced. They offer up to 1600 Gbps of network bandwidth and are designed to deliver up to 20% higher performance over Trn1 for large, network-intensive models, Amazon says. Both Inf2 and Trn1n compete with rival offerings from Google and Microsoft, like Google’s TPU chips for AI training. “AWS offers the most effective cloud infrastructure for generative AI,” Philomin said with confidence. “One of the needs for customers is the right costs for dealing with these models … It’s one of the reasons why many customers haven’t put these models in production.” Them’s fighting words — the growth of generative AI reportedly brought Azure to its knees. Will Amazon suffer the same fate? That’s to be determined."
524,Why a fast-growing climate tech startup raised its second Series B in 13 months,['@tdechant'],"April 24, 2023","Picture this: Fast-growing startup raises a high eight-figure round. Then, a year later, it decides to raise another. Investors line up, and this time they pledge more money while giving the company a healthy valuation bump. What’s wrong with this picture? It’s 2023, a year in which plenty of investors have rolled up the welcome mat, and the company in question isn’t a fintech or a web3 or even a SaaS startup. But bucking the trend is Span, a hardware-focused climate tech company that’s trying to replace the home electrical panel, a device most people only think about when the hair dryer causes the lights to go out. Just a little over a year ago, Span announced that it had closed a $90 million Series B that valued the company at $410 million pre-money. Today, the startup is announcing a $96 million Series B2 that values it at $600 million. (Why B2 and not an extension? Because the company was able to raise its valuation following the initial Series B.) The round was led by Wellington Management with participation by existing investors including Congruent Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group and Alexa Fund. “As we were looking at both our own growth aspirations and extraneous factors,” Arch Rao, founder and CEO of Span, told TechCrunch+, “and as we look at programs like the Inflation Reduction Act, we actually see the opportunity to accelerate over the course of this year or next year. And that’s what prompted the idea of bringing in additional capital.” The Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t changed the company’s business model, but it has changed its business plans, Rao said. “It’s helped us pull forward our addressable market by at least five years.”"
525,Snap quietly acquired 3D-scanning startup Th3rd last year,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 24, 2023","Snap quietly acquired Amsterdam-based 3D-scanning studio Th3rd in the second quarter of last year, at a time when the company was looking to bolster its AR-powered commerce ambitions. A spokesperson for the company confirmed to TechCrunch that four team members from Th3rd, who are based in the Netherlands, joined Snap as part of the acquisition. The company did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Founded in 2014, Th3rd specializes in creating high-quality digital twins of people and products to give brands and retailers a way to digitize their product catalog at scale. After being selected for Adidas’ Accelerator in Europe, the company worked with the retailer to digitize more than 2,500 shoes. Snap declined to share how it incorporated Th3rd’s capabilities into its company, but we understand the startup’s technology has been used to enhance Snap’s AR projects, including its newly launched offering for brands. Yesterday, Snap announced it would start offering its AR tools to enterprise customers. The new SaaS product offers a suite of features, like AR try-on and fit and sizing recommendation tech, to help brands leverage AR technology. Brands can integrate these AR features directly into their apps or websites, Snap had said.   The company has been investing in AR-powered commerce in recent years and is building out its platform to leverage the technology. In April 2022, the company introduced tools that turn retailers’ photos into 3D assets and launched an in-app destination for AR fashion and virtual try-on called “Dress Up.”   A few months before that, Snap rolled out a number of upgrades to better appeal to retailers and brands, including the ability to update product information and pricing in real time, access better analytics and more easily create AR Shopping Lenses, among other things. At the same time, Snap had updated its Lens Web Builder that allowed brands to create shopping Lenses in a matter of minutes. In addition, Snap recently landed a notable partner for its AR-powered commerce ambitions when it announced that it partnered with Amazon for its Virtual Try-On shopping experience. Other brands that have leveraged Snapchat’s AR Shopping Lenses include MAC Cosmetics, Ulta Beauty, American Eagle, Puma, Chanel, Walmart and LVMH. Th3rd is one of the several AR companies that have been acquired by Snap over the last few years. In May 2021, Snap acquired AR startup WaveOptics, a company that supplied the technology that powers Snap’s Spectacles AR glasses, for $500 million. In March 2021, Snap acquired Fit Analytics to further its AR-fueled move into e-commerce. In July 2021, it acquired 3D and AR commerce company Vertebrae. And last year, Snap disclosed it acquired AR company Forma. Given its recent investments, it’s clear that the company sees potential in AR-powered commerce. A combined study from Publicis media and Snap suggests that the AR Retail market will have a project value of $1.2 trillion by 2030. Snap says 250 million Snapchat users have engaged with AR shopping lenses more than 5 billion times since January 2021. For context, Snapchat has 375 million daily active users. The company also recently said in an email that it conducted a study with consulting firm Ipsos and found that 92% of Gen Z users are interested in using AR for shopping. Snap isn’t the only company that has been investing in AR-powered commerce, however, as Pinterest and Google have also leveraged AR to allow shoppers to try on makeup, apparel, and accessories. Amazon also launched a virtual try-on experience for shoes in June 2022, available to consumers in the U.S. and Canada in the Amazon iOS app."
526,"Amazon omits India business in earnings, a first in years",['@refsrc'],"April 28, 2023","Amazon omitted any reference to India in Thursday’s earnings call and release, a notable change for the e-commerce giant that has consistently highlighted rapid growth and bullish outlook in the South Asian market. The absence of India in the Q1 2023 quarterly earnings and investor call, the first since early 2014, follows Amazon’s shutdown of multiple services, including food delivery and wholesale distribution, in the country, prompting many analysts to wonder if the American giant is scaling back operations in the country amid global restructuring. Amazon has poured over $7 billion into its India operations over the last decade and competes aggressively with Walmart-backed Flipkart. Amazon is lagging Flipkart and struggling to make inroads in smaller Indian cities and towns, according to a report by Sanford C. Bernstein. Its global rival Walmart, in contrast, is doubling down on India and has spent close to $2.5 billion in the country this year alone."

528,Hong Kong’s ZA Bank wants to be the go-to bank for crypto startups,['@ritacyliao'],"April 12, 2023","As the collapses of Signature Bank and Silvergate sent crypto companies scrambling, a virtual bank from Hong Kong is extending a warm welcome to web3 startups. Hong Kong-based ZA Bank is now allowed to serve as the settlement bank for regulated web3 companies in the city, the company said today at Hong Kong’s web3 festival, an event that’s backed by the region’s government and has attracted crypto startups and institutions from all over Asia. The online bank is set to facilitate crypto-fiat conversions in conjunction with two licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, HashKey and OSL, where customers can swap crypto into fiat currencies. In other words, the crypto-fiat conversion part is happening over the regulated exchanges rather than ZA Bank directly. ZA Bank will likely be settling transactions for more crypto exchanges as more companies apply to obtain digital assets permits from the Hong Kong authorities. In addition, ZA Bank, which was established by Chinese online insurer ZhongAn in 2017 as one of Hong Kong’s first virtual banks, has started to offer basic banking services to local web3 startups, a category of businesses widely underserved by traditional financial institutions. It will be interesting to see if the handful of other online banks in Hong Kong will follow suit to compete for web3 clients and if ZA Bank’s offering will attract more crypto companies to set up shop in the Asian financial center. The move is happening at a time when Hong Kong is trying to position itself as a crypto-friendly alternative to other hubs like the U.S. and Singapore and act as a sandbox for web3 businesses that originate from China, where crypto trading is illegal. The city has been revamping its digital assets regulatory framework, which tentatively plans to legalize retail trading of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether.   “As Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to cultivate a web3-friendly environment, ZA Bank’s online account opening for Web3 startups represents a major step forward in the integration of traditional banking services with the web3 world,” said Ronald Iu, CEO of ZA Bank. “It signals a greater acceptance and recognition of the importance of this emerging sector and hopefully will encourage other financial institutions to follow suit in offering tailored banking services for web3 companies. We look forward to exploring collaborations with key global web3 businesses such as HashKey, OKX and more.”     "
529,"For Bluesky to thrive, it needs sex workers and Black Twitter",['@morgan_sung'],"May 2, 2023","In the months since Elon Musk took over, and subsequently tanked, Twitter, people have been desperate to find an alternative platform. Bluesky, a decentralized social network backed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is the latest frontrunner.  Bluesky has already gained attention with its irreverent posting culture, but to keep users, it needs to maintain a safe environment for sex workers and other marginalized communities.  In recent weeks, Bluesky has been hailed as a shitposting wonderland and a welcome respite from the increasingly rancid vibes that Twitter has been festering in since Musk took over as CEO. The user interface is nearly identical to Twitter’s. Instead of tweets, users widely refer to posts as “skeets” — despite protest from Bluesky CEO Jay Graber and others who don’t find slang for semen absolutely hilarious.  Reception to Bluesky has been overwhelmingly positive, with users comparing their feeds (unofficially known as the “skyline”) to “the first day of high school” and “early Twitter vibes.” One user described Bluesky as a much-needed smoke break, skeeting, “this app is like the cousins you ‘go for a walk’ with at your conservative family’s thanksgiving dinner.”  Bluesky’s posting culture is noticeably less hostile than Twitter’s — for now. Bluesky’s posting culture is noticeably less hostile than Twitter’s — for now. Though discourse on Bluesky flares up every now and then — like whether users should be allowed to threaten generally disliked public figures with hammers — so far, conflict doesn’t usually reach the fervor of a Twitter spat. Since Bluesky is still invite-only, and users lose remaining invite codes if their invitees are banned, there’s a unique incentive to maintain a less toxic environment than on Twitter. Granted, Bluesky is still in its extremely early days, and with such a small user base, it hasn’t been around long enough for hostility to brew like it has on Twitter.  Bluesky, like Mastodon, aims to be a decentralized, federated social network. But instead of running on ActivityPub, the protocol powering Mastodon and other open source social platforms, Bluesky uses its own AT Protocol, and aims to establish a community labeling system that would allow users to “opt in” to certain content filters. The company also plans to allow users to choose what they want to see by offering a “marketplace of algorithms” instead of using a conventional “master algorithm” employed by most social media sites. Users will be able to switch between seeing specific feeds and viewing multi-algorithm feeds.  “Moderation is a necessary feature of social spaces. It’s how bad behavior gets constrained, norms get set, and disputes get resolved,” Graber wrote in a recent blog post. “We’ve kept the Bluesky app invite-only and are finishing moderation before the last pieces of open federation because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start.” Even in its bare-bones state — users can’t even send DMs yet — Bluesky’s culture already stands out among Twitter alternatives. Mastodon, for example, is populated by tech enthusiasts, academics and journalists, but tends to be so dry that there’s little motivation to scroll it for fun. Skeets, on the other hand, lean into the unhinged. Nudity and sexuality aren’t censored, and scrolling past tiddies on the skyline is to be expected. The cheeky posting culture that exists on Bluesky has only encouraged non-Silicon Valley insiders to join, bringing a fresh energy that other Twitter would-be alternatives are sorely lacking.  Bluesky is a fetus among social media giants like Twitter and Facebook. But in its earliest stage, it has a unique opportunity to cultivate a diverse, vibrant community of the users who made Twitter fun. In its heyday, Twitter’s memes, mutual aid networks and other redeemable traits existed because of Black Twitter and sex workers. Much of internet culture originated in Black communities. “Not safe for work” (NSFW) Twitter receives consistent, and growing, engagement. Adult content makes up 13% of Twitter, according to internal documents obtained by Reuters last year. Aveta, a Black software engineer who has invited over 500 Black users to Bluesky, wasn’t a fan of Mastodon because “a lot of Black people weren’t on there,” and “there was a lot of racism that was going unchecked.” She asked to only be referred to by her first name out of fear of harassment. She made it her mission to invite as many Black users as possible, she said, because Black communities drive the culture of social platforms like Twitter, Instagram and TikTok.  “It’s so crazy that despite how much time has passed, exposing how Black people have so much power and influence, especially in tech communities, especially in social media, that people want to disregard that,” Aveta said. “Yeah, there were people who were in before all that, but the ones who really got it jump started, who really came in at the middle, were Black people.” Before Aveta started inviting other Black users to Bluesky, the site was “very white, very quiet and very small.” She said there was a noticeable vibe shift as more of Black Twitter joined.  “If they want to know where it started, the hype of recent days? Black people. I think my invite tree can be testimony to that.” – Aveta, a software engineer who invited over 500 Black users to Bluesky.

Black people. I think my invite tree can be testimony to that.”  Black Twitter’s influence extends beyond Twitter itself, shaping humor and pop culture both online and in real life. Black creators typically create and spread trends across the internet, from choreographing viral TikTok dances to organizing digital activism. Guides to internet language often describe phrases like “ate this up” and “out of pocket” as “Gen Z slang,” which is misidentified and uncredited African American Vernacular English (AAVE.) “Gagged” and “slay,” for example, originated in the ballroom scene, the Black and Latino drag culture that emerged in 90s New York City.  In a 2016 essay for Model View Culture, Northwestern University professor Lauren Michelle Jackson noted that meme origins are often found in the “circulatory movement of Black vernacular itself.”  “Black folks are hardly the sole proprietors of internet memes, yet it’s undeniable that memes are at their liveliest — that is, which allows them to keep living — is in fact indebted to Black processes of cultural survival,” Jackson wrote.  Twitter is also unique because it allows nudity and sexually explicit content, unlike most major social platforms. The site has become a safe haven for sex work, and provides a centralized space for creators to advertise their services, interact with other sex workers and share vital resources with their community.  Sex work Twitter has existed since Twitter launched in the late 2000s, and grew as other online spaces became more hostile toward sexually explicit content. In 2018, U.S. law enforcement agencies shut down the classified ads site Backpage, and later that year, Tumblr banned porn. Sex workers flocked to Twitter, making that community one of the fastest growing subcultures on the platform.  Twitter is struggling to keep its active users. Last year, market research agency Insider Intelligence predicted that the site will lose more than 30 million users in the next two years. In April, data intelligence firm SimilarWeb reported that users are visiting Twitter less, with a 7.3% drop in worldwide visits in March.  Though interest in Twitter is waning, NSFW content is one of the only topics on the platform gaining interest among English-speaking users. (The other is cryptocurrency.)  But sex workers themselves are questioning whether Twitter will stay safe. After Musk’s takeover in October, many adult content creators expressed concern over losing the sex work community they built on Twitter. For now, Bluesky offers a promising alternative platform with decent moderation.  Olivia Snow, a dominatrix and research fellow at the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, said Musk’s takeover disrupted marginalized communities and made it “more difficult to do literally any job” on the site because “the vibe sucks ass.” She’s hopeful that Bluesky’s moderation and content policies will pave the way for a less hostile social platform than Twitter has become.  “The main thing that I’m heartened by is the fact that they seem to have infrastructure in place for porn. It tells me that they are actually taking moderation seriously,” Snow said. “… Not in the way Twitter has started to, which is allowing whatever, and not the way that Instagram is super anti-sex. The way it’s set up will allow users to really customize their experience.”  Bluesky allows users to set their own content moderation, providing an “infrastructure for porn.” Image Credits: Bluesky Bluesky allows users to set their own content moderation, providing an “infrastructure for porn.” Image Credits: Bluesky Bluesky not only allows explicit content, but also lets users choose the content they want to see. Users can toggle between seeing explicit content on their feeds, having a warning for sensitive content or avoiding it all together. The platform also categorizes content as “explicit sexual images” like pornography, “other nudity” including non-sexual and artistic images, and “sexually suggestive” content that does not include nudity.  Natrix, a sex worker and NFT artist, was originally skeptical of censorship on Bluesky.  “I do think the lines between these categories can still be blurry, but that will always be the case with art and porn, as sexualization is so subjective,” Natrix said. “It will be interesting how things progress once the platform grows and how their detection system is fine-tuned, which they acknowledge is not yet perfect.”  The delineation is still clearer than Tumblr’s approach to easing content policies after its 2018 porn ban. Late last year, Tumblr started allowing nudity again, but not “depictions of sexually explicit acts,” causing confusion among users. Some adult content creators said their NSFW content was flagged even if it didn’t contain nudity.  “Giving users the option to choose which of these potentially sensitive categories they see, rather than outright banning or shadowbanning entire accounts, is still miles ahead of what we are used to on Twitter or Instagram, where sex workers are too often selectively punished for being sex workers more than for the content itself,” Natrix said.  Snow also questioned how Bluesky would handle doxxing. OnlyFans immediately bans users for sharing creators’ legal names, but no other social platform considers that to be doxxing. Meta Verified came under fire in sex work circles for requiring users to change their Instagram display name to the name on their government ID in order to receive verification.  Marginalized communities are usually responsible for building social media subcultures, but are also disproportionately moderated and harassed online. Black TikTok creators have repeatedly spoken out about how content discussing race and cultural appropriation appears to be censored on the app. Last year, a coalition of Black Twitch streamers penned an open letter to the company demanding better protection from harassment. And under Musk’s tutelage, hate speech on Twitter has skyrocketed.   If Bluesky aspires to be a viable alternative to Twitter, it needs to be better than Twitter was at its peak — and safer for marginalized users. In its nascent, invite-only phase, it’s already demonstrated that it will take action against hate speech. Over the weekend, Bluesky swiftly banned a user who harassed others with transphobic remarks.  the ceo of bl**sk* quickly banning and then putting a transphobe's head on a pike as a warning to others, honestly extremely based pic.twitter.com/zi6kc2W76O — Michael (@_FleerUltra) April 30, 2023  Bluesky does appear open to fostering a sex worker community. Natrix noted that she received coveted invite codes (users usually only receive one code every two weeks, unless they’re gifted more by Bluesky staff) after she posted about wanting to bring more sex workers to the platform.  Though Bluesky doesn’t shun adult content, the platform does appear to be adding some restrictions on nudity. As of Monday, though, the platform has a “no boobs (or dicks, or asses)” on the discovery page policy, per a post from Bluesky technical advisor Jeremy Johnson. The goal, Johnson said, is for users to avoid nudity unless they deliberately opt in.  The platform may be safe for sex workers now, but like Tumblr, could take on more puritanical policies as it faces external pressure over time. “We also know that sex workers often help to shape platforms and the way people use them, only to be pushed off later — but maybe the decentralized nature of it all will help when the going gets rough,” Natrix said.  Bluesky’s current draw is that it’s a more fun, less toxic version of Twitter. Plenty of would-be alternatives have emerged in the last year, each promising a newer, shinier user experience. Most have fizzled out as users either lost interest or grew horrified with the kind of rampant hate speech that also already exists on Twitter. By refusing to harbor hate speech, Bluesky is already distancing itself from Musk’s Twitter, but that commitment will truly be tested when it starts onboarding more users. Of course, keeping tabs on 50,000 users is nothing compared to moderating the hundreds of millions of users on a mature social network. It’s unrealistic to expect a platform to be free of conflict entirely, and even in its insular, invite-only mode, the site has already seen its fair share of discourse. Bluesky doesn’t need to be a utopian paradise for it to make a lasting impact, but it does need to establish guardrails to protect the vulnerable communities that are already shaping its culture — especially its Black users and sex workers. Booting transphobes from the site is a good start. "
530,How Swytch used ‘crowdshopping’ to scale without VC money,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 23, 2023","The pandemic era taught many of us that bikes are a great way to get around cities. Doubly so if they are e-bikes, replete with batteries to help reduce the amount of sweat required to get somewhere. Swytch Technology, a startup that builds e-bike conversion kits, isn’t targeting your average cyclist in the United States or Europe, however. Instead, the U.K.-based startup offers regular bike riders a way to turn their existing bike into something with a little more oomph. Swytch’s conversion kit is one of the lightest and smallest on the market, similar in size to a large smartphone and weighing just 1.5 pounds. It recharges in one hour, provides 10 miles of range and can easily be fitted onto bikes by anyone who “knows how to use an Allen key and has put together a piece of Ikea furniture,” co-founder and CEO Oliver Montague told TechCrunch+. Oh, and if you preorder, it only costs around $500. Swytch launched in 2017 via an Indiegogo campaign, during which time Montague learned about the benefits of crowdfunding when launching a new product. Crowdfunding eventually gave way to crowdshopping, which involves having customers pay a deposit on a kit to be delivered at a future date. This, Montague says, has helped Swytch scale quickly for a small company without major VC funding by eliminating the need to hold onto too much inventory. Instead, Swytch uses the money from deposits to fund production on an almost a la carte basis. To date, Swytch has shipped over 70,000 kits globally. There’s a waitlist of over 1.5 million customers who have registered interest in the next release; Swytch recently had to close preorders because it is sold out until May and is busy fulfilling over 5,000 orders per month to customers today. Its next batch of stock will be available for delivery in June, and preorders will reopen next month. The company isn’t sitting still. Swytch is moving onto its next phase of growth, which might involve new product offerings and partnerships. So we sat down with Montague to discuss the pitfalls of VC funding, why keeping stock on hand opens you up to risk and how Swytch scaled so quickly without raising much equity. (Editor’s note: The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.) Swytch has been able to scale quite rapidly without relying on much, or any, venture capital funding. You say it’s because of your “crowdshopping” model. Can you explain how that’s different from crowdfunding? Crowdfunding is when lots of people get together and get big discounts to support a new product that will be delivered in the future. Maybe. And that’s the big thing about crowdfunding: the big “maybe” at the end. Lots of crowdfunding projects never deliver anything. Or they deliver something, but it doesn’t work. Or it works, but there’s no customer service, and the company folds a year later."
531,"Ex-Fin Capital general partner, who led its investment in Pipe, starts new venture firm",['@bayareawriter'],"May 5, 2023","Peter Ackerson has departed from his role as general partner at fintech-focused venture firm Fin Capital and started a new firm, Audere Capital. According to his LinkedIn profile, Ackerson — who joined Fin Capital in August of 2019 — stopped working at that firm in January of this year. While his profile shows that he became a general partner of Audere Capital in February 2023, it appears that he only updated his online presence to reflect his new position this week. There is not much public information about Audere other than it’s listed under the “Financial Services” category on LinkedIn and its tagline is “championing American innovation through early-stage technology investment.” A source with familiarity of internal happenings at Fin Capital alleges there was tension between Ackerson and managing partner and founder Logan Allin around portfolio company alternative financing startup Pipe — an investment into which Ackerson led and on whose board he sat. The exact circumstances around his departure are unclear.  For a while, Pipe was quite buzzy, catapulting to a $2 billion valuation on the premise that it helped SaaS companies generate non-dilutive cash with a model that provided upfront capital for recurring revenue.  But last November, Pipe announced that its three co-founders were stepping down from their executive roles and that a search for a new, “veteran” CEO had commenced. Soon after that announcement, several sources who wished to remain anonymous — including one investor who says he passed on investing in the startup in its early days — told TechCrunch that they “heard” that Pipe had made roughly $80 million in loans to one or several crypto mining companies. The outfit or outfits have since gone out of business and the $80 million is believed to have been completely written off, said these individuals. Pipe denied the claims and Luke Voiles was named its new CEO in February. Fin Capital (called Fin VC at the time) led Pipe’s $60 million financing in June of 2020. When asked if the management shakeup and alleged preceding circumstances at Pipe had anything to do with Ackerson’s departure, Allin told TechCrunch in an emailed statement: Peter was integral to the early growth of Fin Capital and we greatly appreciate his contributions. Peter departed the firm to pursue other opportunities and remains a close friend and ally of the firm. With respect to Pipe, our team is collaborating closely with Luke Voiles, who is a terrific CEO and has our full support as the team focuses on the next phase of growth for the company.  Ackerson declined to comment on the record. According to LinkedIn, Maggie Sprenger joined his new firm, Audere Capital, in April. Both she and Ackerson are Kaufmann Fellows, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Founded in 2018, Fin Capital invests in the B2B fintech sector with a focus on enterprise SaaS across the United States and Europe. According to Crunchbase, it has over $1 billion in assets under management. Fin was an investor in SoFi, and has backed the likes of Figure, Hummingbird and Elevate. While at Fin Capital, which appears to have been his first VC role, Ackerson served on the boards of companies such as Maxwell, Teampay, Pipe, SamCart and Ternary. He previously served as CFO of SymphonyAI and sat on the board of numerous other companies.  Prior to SymphonyAI, Ackerson worked at McKinsey & Co. in the fast growth tech practice; with Wells Fargo in the global technology equity research group, including working on Facebook, ServiceNow, Marin Software, and Groupon IPOs; and with Merrill Lynch in the technology investment banking group.

533,You can now access Snapchat Lenses during Microsoft Teams meetings,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 10, 2023","Tired of using virtual backgrounds to spice up your Microsoft Teams calls? Well, you now have a new way to express yourself during meetings. Microsoft and Snap have today announced the integration of Snapchat Lenses for Teams to bring a bit of fun to virtual meetings. As part of the integration, Teams users will get access to a collection of 26 popular Lenses during meetings. You can use the Lenses to do things like transform yourself into a cartoon character or add fun backgrounds to your video. Snap says the new integration aims to allow for more fun and engaging meetings. You don’t need to download anything to access the Lenses, as you can get started by clicking on “Video effects” and selecting the “Snapchat” tab. “With the rise of hybrid and flexible work, our customers need tools that help build connections and foster a productive and enjoyable work environment,” said Microsoft Teams Vice President Nicole Herskowitz in an emailed statement. “That’s why we are excited to bring Snapchat’s most popular Lenses natively into Microsoft Teams meetings, making it easy for users to add even more personality and fun to video calls. With Snapchat Lenses for Teams, we are offering customers a new way to express themselves and engage with co-workers in a dynamic and entertaining manner.” Snap says the integration is made possible by Camera Kit, Snap’s SDK that allows partners to leverage Snap’s AR technology in their own applications and websites. It’s worth noting that this is Microsoft’s second integration with Camera Kit. The company has also used Camera Kit to bring Snap AR into Flip, Microsoft’s video learning platform where educators can post topic prompts to spark video discussions among students. Since adding Snap AR to the Flip web experience, the company has seen a 60% increase in students and teachers creating videos. Today’s announcement comes a few months after Snap shut down its camera app for desktop that allowed users to apply filters on video calls. At the time, Snap said that it was focusing more on expanding Camera Kit access for the web. The company first introduced Snap Camera in 2018 as a way for creators to spice up their Twitch stream, but the camera app really took off during the pandemic in 2020 when people started using it with video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams, Skype, YouTube, Google Hangouts, Skype and Zoom. The app, available on both Windows and Mac, allowed users to switch between different face filters during a video call or a livestream. Snap says it’s continuing to work closely with new partners to integrate Camera Kit, which means we will likely see Snapchat Lenses pop up in more popular apps and platform in the future.  "

535,Rivian sticks to 2023 production goal for EVs despite quarterly dip,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 3, 2023","EV automaker Rivian said Monday it produced 9,395 vehicles at its factory in Normal, Illinois in the first quarter, lower than the previous period but still on track to hit its 50,000 production goal for the year. Rivian said it delivered 7,946 of those vehicles in the first quarter. Rivian’s first-quarter delivery numbers just missed analysts’ expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Rivian to deliver about 8,000 vehicles. Shares fell 4.3% following the announcement. Those Q1 numbers were higher than the same quarter last year, a time when Rivian was grappling with supply chain constraints in the midst of scaling up production. Still, they were lower than its Q4 results. Rivian produced 10,020 EVs in Q4 and delivered 8,504 in the same period. Rivian has struggled with supply chain problems — specifically semiconductors — since production of its R1T truck began in late 2021. Those problems didn’t abate in 2022, forcing the company to scale back production guidance from 50,000 to 25,000 vehicles for 2022. Even with that lower, more conservative guidance Rivian didn’t quite hit the mark. Rivian produced 24,337 vehicles and delivered 20,332 vehicles in 2022. Rivian is scheduled to host an audio webcast at 2 pm PT May 9 following the release of its first-quarter earnings results."
536,WhatsApp now lets you create single-vote polls and forward media with captions,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 4, 2023","WhatsApp is adding a few new updates around polls and sharing on its platform, the company announced on Thursday. Most notably, you can now create single-vote polls and forward media with captions. You now have the option to create single-vote polls, which means you can run a poll where people are only allowed to vote once. Currently, polls are multiple-choice by default. You can turn off the “allow multiple answers” option when creating a poll. The messaging app now also lets users filter messages by polls, just like you can with photos, videos or links. You can do so by pressing “Search” and then “Polls” to find a list of all results. In addition, you will now receive notifications when people vote on your polls. You will also be shown how many people total have voted in the poll. As for sharing, you can now forward media with captions. WhatsApp notes that when you forward media that has a caption, you now have the option to keep, delate or completely rewrite it. WhatsApp notes that in the past, you may not have had time to add context to forwarded media before someone responds. Another new update will let you add a caption before sharing a document. WhatsApp says the new updates have started rolling out globally and will be available to all users in the coming weeks. The new updates come a week after WhatsApp finally rolled out multidevice login support for more than one phone. Until now, users could use only one WhatsApp account on one phone and multiple companion desktop devices. With the new rollout, users’ messages will be synced across devices, including other phones. So even if one device is switched off, they can access the app on other devices.  "
537,"OpenView goes bigger with seventh fund, closing on $570M to invest in business software startups",['@christinemhall'],"March 27, 2023","Three years after announcing its sixth fund, OpenView Venture Partners is back with $570 million in capital commitments for its new, seventh fund. It represents a 25% increase over the firm’s $450 million sixth fund, its largest to date. The Boston-based venture capital firm gave its intent to raise the fund back in January 2022, according to an SEC filing that noted OpenView intended on a hard cap of $800 million. In another filing made last September, the firm reported it had raised just over $517 million toward that goal. “The way that we’ve always built the firm and the funds is to stay relatively small and concentrated,” Mackey Craven, OpenView partner, told TechCrunch. “When we went out to raise the fund, the way we size them is bottoms up: looking at how many partners we have, the average investment size they make, how many investments we make in a year and how many years we want to be out. That gives you a range, and that range is from right about where we closed the fund.” The firm will continue to focus its investments on “high-growth software startups,” investing globally across business software categories including infrastructure, applications, cybersecurity and vertical software. While there is some turmoil in the financial markets and the banking system, Craven says the product markets for software, looking broadly, “are stronger than they’ve ever been.” He notes that global software spend is about twice what it was five years ago and is still growing at double-digit rates.   He attributes that growth to what he called a “go-to-market model” for software companies for product-led growth, a term that Craven said was coined years ago by partners Kyle Poyar and Blake Bartlett to describe what was making businesses more efficient. We profiled OpenView in 2020 when it closed its sixth fund, and in terms of when it invests in companies, Craven told my colleague Alex Wilhelm that the firm looks for companies that have between $1 million and $10 million in annual recurring revenue. Three years later, Craven said that criteria hasn’t changed much, explaining that OpenView tends to be the first investor in a company after it is generating revenue, no matter if it was bootstrapped or venture-backed before that. For example, he said his first investment was in cloud monitoring platform DataDog after it had $1.7 million in ARR. “It’s more than 1,000 times larger than that right today, but that’s very similar in the scale of businesses that we’re investing in right now,” Craven said. Kyle Poyar further explained, “It’s more about the underlying qualitative characteristics of the business. It says specifically, we’d love to see the company find product-market fit with their customers, and they’re showing signs that they’re ready to scale with building out their teams and their go-to-market motions. That tends to correspond with that revenue range rather than the revenue range being the focus.” When asked how different it was to go after funding in today’s economic climate versus when OpenView was raising for its sixth fund, Craven responded, “it absolutely is a more challenging fundraising environment,” but noted that the firm’s core partners have worked together for over a decade, so there was still a “strong set of supportive limited partners” who were receptive to getting in on another fund, one that was also larger. OpenView invested in 16 companies with its sixth fund and expects with its seventh fund — being 25% bigger — it could invest in up to 20 companies over the next few years. As of today, the firm made its first investment from Fund VII in a company called Rewst, which is doing robotic process automation for the managed service provider sector. “Rewst is in a combination of themes we’re excited about, like vertical software and the increasing automation of software workflow,” Craven said. “It turns out that in the managed services ecosystem, the vast majority of the work that they do, and outsource, is workflow-oriented. The entrepreneur has built a business in this space before and is off to a great start.” Meanwhile, business software spending is expected to rise despite analyst predictions that consumers will scale spending. When it comes to trends within this area that the firm is following, Craven said that companies are continuing to spend in areas that deal with risk, for example, cybersecurity. Another is automation: Companies rely increasingly on software instead of on people to do some of those activities. As a result, the firm is looking at domain-specific applications of machine intelligence and software around integrations, automation and workflow, he said. Poyar also said vertical software and product-led growth are two additional themes that will continue to be among investments. “Regarding vertical software, there’s a lot of folks who really need software, but don’t have great solutions because that is a market that has historically been underserved by software players,” Poyar added. “We coined the term ‘product-led growth’ in 2016 because of trends we were seeing in the software market. That’s now a part of the market that is continuing to grow as product-led businesses. By just building products that customers love, they are growing in a way that’s more efficient and more effective than their peers.”  "
538,Nextdoor launches new ‘Assistant’ feature powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 2, 2023","Neighborhood social network Nextdoor is introducing new features powered by generative AI, the company announced on Tuesday. Most notably, Nextdoor is launching a new “Assistant” feature that helps users on the app write better posts. The new Assistant feature, which is being tested with select users, is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Assistant feature is designed to help users write posts that are more likely to drive positive community engagement. When writing a new post, users will start to see a revised suggestion that they can review and edit before finishing their post. Additionally, Assistant will suggest ways to rephrase potentially harmful comments to make the same point in a more friendly way. “With ChatGPT launching in November, we saw an opportunity to train ChatGPT technology on top of our proprietary local knowledge to create something we think really helps users create a more engaging post,” Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar told TechCrunch in an interview. “We’re now giving you an assistant that says ‘Hey neighbor, would you like to rephrase or reword this post to have more neighbors comment and react to it.’ It’s able to help you create posts and ultimately engage your neighborhood.” Nextdoor currently has a “Kindness Reminder” feature that notifies users of the platform’s community guidelines and gives users the opportunity to reflect on a potentially harmful post. With the new Assistant feature, Nextdoor will start helping users rewrite posts to come across kinder. Say you and a neighbor are discussing the addition of new speed bumps in your neighborhood and you write a heated response. Assistant will help you reword or rephrase your post to ensure that your message comes across in a balanced and constructive way. In addition, Nextdoor says the new generative AI technologies enable the platform to deliver more personalized and relevant content to users by analyzing the topic and context of conversations. As a result, Nextdoor can better match content to users and provide more targeted recommendations for local news, events and activities. Friar says Nextdoor is prioritizing safety with this launch, noting that users don’t have to interact with the new features. For instance, you don’t have to accept the suggestions that Assistant makes, you can go on and post as you would like to while still adhering to the platform’s community guidelines. Nextdoor initially began testing the new features with 25% of its users, and is making them more broadly available starting today, but the company doesn’t plan to make the features available to 100% of its user base just yet. Friar says Nextdoor plans to continue to test the features and make sure it’s rolling out the technology safely before making it available to everyone. The features will roll out to everyone in the United States overtime, and then eventually to the other markets where Nextdoor is available. “We’ll watch to make sure that there aren’t unforeseen consequences, and of course be accountable,” Friar said. “We’ll continue to move at the right pace to make sure we’re doing it the right way. With any new technology, there’s always concern about what could happen, but at the same time, we want to make AI available to the masses. I feel like everyone has a right to understand how this technology can make their life more efficient.” Nextdoor plans to continue testing generative AI models and is building a dedicated generative AI team led by the company’s Head of AI Qi He, who joined Nextdoor last year after more than eight years at LinkedIn. The dedicated team will be hiring product leaders and engineers to advance the company’s use of AI across its platform. Last year, Nextdoor revamped its app with new profiles and more community-building features. The changes came as the social network developed a reputation for racial profiling over the years, which led to Nextdoor releasing specific features to address this and the company’s former CEO stepping down. The revamp was part of Nextdoor’s larger vision and its goal to create a welcoming neighborhood both online and offline.  "
539,"YouTube’s new metric shows an artist’s reach across all formats, including Shorts",['@aiishamalik1'],"March 30, 2023","YouTube announced today that it is expanding its Analytics for Artists tool by adding YouTube Shorts-related data to the “Total Reach” metric, which gives artists and their teams an overview of how their music is reaching audiences across YouTube. Prior to this expansion, the Total Reach metric only included official content uploaded by the artist and long-form videos uploaded by fans. YouTube says the new updated metric shows how many people an artist’s music is reaching across all formats. Lyor Cohen, YouTube’s global head of Music, said in a blog post that fan-created Shorts increased the average artist’s audience of unique viewers by more than 80% in January 2023. In addition, artists who are active on Shorts saw more than 50% of their new channel subscribers coming directly from their Shorts posts on average. The company is also launching a new “Songs” section in its Analytics tool to help artists and their teams see how fans are listening to their music or creating with it, across all video formats. In the new Songs section, artists will see their top songs from the past 28 days and what songs are being most used in Shorts. “Shorts are the appetizer to the entrée,” Cohen wrote. “They are the entry point, leading fans to discover the depth of an artist’s catalog, including music videos, interviews, live performances, lyric videos, and more. Look at Rema & Selena Gomez winning big by leveraging all the video formats available on YouTube. After they surpassed 60 million unique viewers of their official music videos and Shorts for Calm Down, fans uploaded Shorts featuring their track, taking viewership to another level: adding 350 million unique viewers in January, an increase of over 500%.” Image Credits: YouTube Image Credits: YouTube In another example, Cohen noted that artist Oliver Tree uploading 20 Shorts and four long-form videos tied to his song Miss You, after which his channel’s monthly viewers increased from six million to 75 million in over four months. Users brought in another 1.8 billion views in January by uploading Shorts featuring the song. By incorporating YouTube Shorts data to the Total Reach metric, the company may be looking to encourage more artists to use Shorts to promote their new music, which would in turn, lead to more daily views of Shorts. Today’s announcement comes as Google revealed last month that YouTube Shorts are now being watched by more than 1.5 billion logged-in users every month and averaging over 50 billion daily views. Although this is a notable milestone, it’s worth noting that the number of views on Shorts lags on Instagram and Facebook. Last October, Meta said that Reels garnered 140 billion daily views across both social networks. YouTube has been looking for ways to increase viewership of Shorts. For instance, the company rolled out Shorts on TV last November. The move was seen as a way to help YouTube to better challenge TikTok, which had also rolled out its own TV app to various platforms last year.  "
540,YouTube gives advertisers new ad formats across Shorts,['@laurenforristal'],"May 1, 2023","As part of this year’s YouTube NewFronts presentation, the company announced Monday that it’s rolling out new ad formats to its short-form feature Shorts. Of note, the company is expanding Shorts into its video reach campaigns. Video reach campaigns use Google AI to improve reach by combining ad formats like skippable and non-skippable ads. With the update, advertisers can now upload a 60-second vertical video in order to reach engaged viewers. Previously, brands could only access Shorts inventory via Video action campaigns and App Install campaigns, which the company announced in 2022 during Google Marketing Live. Paramount+ was among the early partners to test the latest version of video reach campaigns, YouTube wrote in its official blog post. The streaming service promoted its new movie, “At Midnight,” across YouTube’s in-feed, in-stream and Shorts ad experiences. According to YouTube, Paramount+’s recent ad campaign “drove higher efficiencies and higher ad recall” as opposed to only having in-stream ads, the company wrote. Shorts currently attracts 1.5 billion viewers each month, the company said during its announcement, and Shorts are now seeing 50 billion views daily. Separately, YouTube announced that it is expanding reach ads into the home feed. Also, the company added that YouTube Select, its targeting solution for advertisers to pick out content packages and further connect with their audience, is coming to Shorts. This will enable brands to present ads alongside popular and relevant short-form videos. The Shorts lineup for YouTube Select will become available later this year. Plus, YouTube is letting advertisers have their ad be the first a viewer sees after they start scrolling through Shorts. TikTok, a major Shorts rival, has similar tools for advertisers. “As our viewers bounce between long-form videos and Shorts, discovering tons of new artists on the platform, they’re also discovering brands,” said Kristen O’Hara, VP of agency and brand solutions, during the NewFronts presentation. “Since we launched Shorts and video action campaigns last year, we have seen many, many brands really lean into how they can use Shorts.” In its latest earnings report, YouTube earned $6.69 billion in ad revenue — a 2.6% drop year over year. While it was the third quarter in a row that ad revenue decreased, YouTube continues to focus on Shorts as its pride and joy. Earlier this year, Shorts reached 50 billion daily views.    "
541,Tesla brings back the long-range Model 3 with an 18% discount,['@harriblogs'],"May 4, 2023","After a nearly nine-month hiatus, Tesla has reopened orders for its long-range Model 3. The vehicle reappeared on the automaker’s website earlier this week with a steep price drop. It previously started at $57,990, but now sits at $47,240 before any interior, exterior or software upgrades. Still, this roughly 18.5% discount seems to come with a catch. Tesla previously advertised a 358-mile range before it paused orders on the longer-range vehicle last August. The company now lists the model as having a maximum range of “325+” miles, for drivers who choose the 18-inch “Aero Wheels” configuration. The long-range Model 3’s projected range drops to 310 miles with the 19-inch “Sport Wheels” upgrade. As Engadget reports, the change may be linked to Tesla’s ongoing cost-cutting efforts. For reference, Tesla advertises a 267 to 272-mile range for its regular-old Model 3, depending on the wheels. Like its stock, the starting price for Tesla’s vehicles have proved particularly unsteady in recent months. In December, the automaker cut prices for Model 3 and Model Y buyers to boost end-of-year sales, unnerving some of its investors in the process. Tesla issued additional cuts in April, and then it bumped prices up again just yesterday. Tesla’s discounts cut into its margins in the first quarter of this year; the automaker recorded a 24% drop in net income in Q1 2023 from the same period last year. "
542,6 common challenges facing cybersecurity teams and how to overcome them,['@rosshaleliuk'],"April 6, 2023","Building products and companies in cybersecurity is not an easy task because in many ways, the industry behaves differently from others. To start, it is very crowded, with hundreds and thousands of undifferentiated solutions promising to solve all security problems and more often than not, falling short of their promises. Moreover, it is an incredibly dynamic space with the landscape sometimes shifting overnight. As a product leader, I meet many entrepreneurs and startup founders and see over and over how the vast majority get slowed down by the same types of problems. In this post, I am looking at six challenges of building products in cybersecurity and ways to overcome them. As a product leader, I meet many entrepreneurs and startup founders and see over and over how the vast majority get slowed down by the same types of problems. In most industries, buyers and end users are open to talking to vendors because they recognize that software providers are there to identify their problems, pain points and inefficiencies, and build solutions that remove them. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said about cybersecurity where few leaders (Chief Information Security Officers or CISOs) or practitioners are open to having transparent conversations with strangers. There are several reasons why this is the case: All this makes the lives of cybersecurity product leaders incredibly hard as it essentially makes them unable to do customer discovery, learn about pain points and brainstorm potential solutions. Here are some of the ways to address this: "
543,Waymo doubles robotaxi service area in Phoenix in bid to grow driverless trips tenfold,['@kirstenkorosec'],"May 4, 2023","Waymo is doubling its commercial robotaxi service area in the Phoenix metro area, an expansion that will add new suburbs and connect previously isolated sections of the sprawling and car-dependent desert city. The service area, which now includes Scottsdale, nearly all of Tempe and larger sections of Chandler and Mesa, is 180 square miles in size. That’s about one-third of the 517-square-mile Phoenix metro area. Importantly, it connects downtown to Arizona State University in Tempe and other East Valley suburbs. The former Google self-driving project under Alphabet is also adding a second location that accesses the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Riders can already get to the airport by taking a Waymo robotaxi to the 44th Street Phoenix SkyTrain Station, which has frequent round-the-clock trains to the main terminals. Waymo robotaxis will now pick up and drop off passengers at the new 24th Street PHX SkyTrain Station. A larger service area, particularly one that allows for riders to take driverless Waymo vehicles from one suburb to downtown or to the airport, is critical for the company to grow its business and generate more revenue. The expansion will also help the company scale beyond the 10,000 autonomous trips that public riders take each week in Phoenix and San Francisco combined, Waymo Chief Product Officer Saswat Panigrahi said in a media briefing. Panigrahi did not disclose what percentage of those rides were in Phoenix, where it can charge. “We’re clearly excited about the trajectory we’re going to be on and we believe we can hit 10x of that scale by next summer, roughly,” Panigrahi said. Image Credits: Waymo Image Credits: Waymo Phoenix has been an important launch pad for Waymo — and the only city where it is currently allowed to charge for rides. It’s where the company began testing its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans in suburbs like Chandler in 2016 and expanded the following year with its early rider program, which gave vetted members of the public access to the vehicles (always with a human safety driver behind the wheel). Waymo removed employees and passengers from its test fleet in 2017, sending empty self-driving minivans onto the streets of greater Phoenix. Waymo began in May 2018 allowing some early riders to hail a self-driving minivan without a human test driver behind the wheel. By December of that year, the company launched its commercial robotaxi service called Waymo One in Phoenix. Waymo is also putting its resources into growing its service area in San Francisco, despite the lack of revenue. Waymo is still waiting for the California Public Utilities Commission to issue the final permit that will allow the company to charge for rides in its driverless Jaguar I Pace vehicles. The company said Thursday it is adding more people to its Waymo One service, which gives them access to the app and the ability to hail a driverless vehicle. Waymo’s aspirations to add more self-driving vehicles to its fleet and expand its service area has hit some speed bumps. Videos of Waymo and rival Cruise vehicles clogging streets have circulated on social media, prompting city officials and some residents to criticize the technology. Earlier this year, San Francisco transportation officials sent protest letters to the CPUC asking the agency to slow down the companies’ expansion plans."
544,"So long, Terran 1: Relativity Space makes hard pivot to an even larger Terran R",['@breadfrom'],"April 12, 2023","Relativity Space is retiring Terran 1 after just a single test flight to double-down on development of its next-generation Terran R rocket, which is now configured to be even larger than previously announced. The six-year-old company is making other significant changes to Terran R: The rocket will no longer be completely reusable, but fitted with an expendable second stage. In addition, its design will rely less on additive manufacturing, the technology that Relativity is best-known for advancing and that it has touted in each of its capital raises. These changes mean that the 270-foot tall Terran R will now have a payload capacity of 23.5 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 33.5 metric tons when launched as a fully expendable vehicle. The rocket will be propelled by 13 Aeon R engines on the first stage (instead of the originally planned seven) and a single Aeon Vac engine on the second stage. Both engines were designed in-house by Relativity. Notably, the company will now be manufacturing some parts of the vehicle, like the tank barrels, using aluminum alloy and traditional metal-bending techniques rather than via 3D printing. Image Credits: Relativity Space Image Credits: Relativity Space While Relativity has been upfront about Terran 1 mostly functioning as a development platform to technologically pave the way for Terran R, it was assumed that the company would fly Terran 1 at least a few more times before retiring it. In some ways, the news reveals a clear boldness: All the company’s eggs are now in a single basket. Probably the biggest bet is how the rocket redesign has pushed back the launch timeline by at least two years, to 2026 (last summer, Relativity announced a Mars mission using Terran R in 2024). But seen in another light, Relativity is just falling in line with other launch companies that are either abandoning small launchers (like Astra) or already at work on larger vehicles to complement a rocket with flight heritage (like Rocket Lab and SpaceX). Relativity’s pivot also makes sense giving the considerable headwinds up against the small launch market. Chief amongst these is SpaceX’s rideshare service, which lets multiple customers split the cost of a Falcon 9 launch. The unit economics of small launch are even tougher when the rocket is not reusable. The spectacular demise of Virgin Orbit this month is just the latest example of the brutality of targeting the small satellite segment of the launch market. As of 2021, Relativity has raised at least $1.3 billion at a $4.2 billion valuation. As they are not a public company, it’s unclear how much capital the company has left to see it through Terran R’s first flight. Relativity’s sole test of Terran 1 on March 22 concluded with an anomaly with the rocket’s second stage, which occurred roughly three minutes after lift-off. Shortly after stage separation, the second stage’s single Aeon Vac engine did not manage to reach full power, and Relativity engineers sent a command to terminate the mission. But while the rocket did not manage to reach orbit, the launch was far from a loss; indeed, Relativity said Wednesday that it validated that “3D printed rockets are structurally viable, capable of withstanding maximum stresses during flight.” The company added that designing, manufacturing, and testing Terran 1 — and developing the requisite technologies to do so, like the company’s Stargate 3D metal printers — paved the way for work on the next vehicle. The company said Wednesday that it would move customer contracts for the Terran 1 to the Terran R rocket, and work with NASA to get Terran R qualified for launch contracts under the agency’s Venture Class Launch Services program. Relativity will continue to build out its existing facilities at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida, where it conducted its March launch. Image Credits: Relativity Space

545,Faraday Future is adding generative AI to its vaporware EV,['@kirstenkorosec'],"May 2, 2023","Faraday Future is nearly out of cash and its long-delayed EV has yet to land in customers’ hands, which means this is the perfect time for the publicly traded company to jump head first into the AI hype machine. Faraday Future said Tuesday it is adding generative AI to its first production car, the FF 91 Futurist. Never mind that the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed for years, that as of three weeks ago Faraday Future was down to its last $30 million and was pushing the delivery date again or that the company has bounced from one internal drama to another. None of this matters, because by merely mentioning the words “generative AI,” the money will surely come pouring in. And whadda ya know? The stock popped 6.2% following the announcement. Of course, fundamentals often catch up to even the wiliest of publicly traded companies. That stock bump may not last. Faraday Future said it has launched a “Generative AI Product Stack,” which will be integrated into FF 91. The company claims that “through this Generative AI Product Stack, the company has integrated its foundational AI capabilities with advanced models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and others from companies such as OpenAI and Microsoft.” If that sentence sounds like vaporware version of Mad Libs, you wouldn’t be wrong. ChatGPT is a text-generating AI chatbot developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. In February, Microsoft integrated the GPT-4 model into its Bing search engine. So basically, Faraday Future said a bunch of words that means it plans to use ChatGPT. The company goes on in the announcement to add that “with this Generative AI Product Stack, the company has the potential to scale to additional advanced generative AI models, giving extraordinary abilities to users.” Faraday Future doesn’t explain what additional advanced generative AI models means or what extraordinary abilities will be provided to users. The company said it plans to use generative AI for personalized applications like “complex text and voice queries, image and video generation, stock analysis, live translations, search, entertainment, education, e-commerce, and more.” It’s worth noting that today’s new vehicle models are equipped with software that includes natural language processing capabilities — aka voice assistants that can provide navigation and handle other queries. Generative AI is unnecessary to provide these functions. The first production build FF 91 vehicle came off the assembly line at its facility in Hanford, California in April. But customer deliveries have yet to begin. Faraday Future pushed back initial deliveries of its FF 91 Futurist EV — part one of a three-phase plan — to the end of May. The next two phases of production and delivery are still a question mark. Faraday Future said it will need “substantial additional financing” to start the second and third phase delivery and is in discussions with additional potential investors.” Faraday Future also has yet to complete crash tests."
546,Walmart-backed PhonePe set to challenge Google’s dominance with app store in India,['@refsrc'],"April 23, 2023","Indian fintech giant PhonePe is preparing to launch a dedicated app store for Android users in India, the latest product push from the Walmart-backed firm that commands the mobile payments market in the second largest Asian economy. The app store, designed to offer hyper-localized services based on customer context, aims to assist developers with “high-quality” user acquisition through multilingual solutions, according to an internal company document reviewed by TechCrunch. PhonePe entering the app store market, still several weeks away, follows the Bengaluru-headquartered startup acquiring IndusOS, an app store maker that served customers through partnership with smartphone vendors. PhonePe, the most valuable Indian fintech startup that competes aggressively with Google’s Google Pay app in India, plans to strengthen its engagement with smartphone vendors, including with firms such as Xiaomi, according to a source familiar with the matter. The app store will offer “premiere experience for millions of users with high-quality advertisements and custom targeting,” support for 12 languages and 24×7 live chat, the document said. Building an app store has long been one of the focuses for PhonePe, according to a senior developer who has engaged with the startup’s leadership team. PhonePe, which has offered a mini app store within its marquee app for years, has held the view that consumers are reluctant to download multiple apps on their phones, the developer said, who like the other source, requested anonymity to speak candidly. PhonePe — which has raised $750 million from General Atlantic, Walmart and Tiger Global among others as part of an ongoing funding round this year — confirmed that it’s working to launch an app store in India. In a statement to TechCrunch, a PhonePe spokesperson said that Google commands 97% of the Indian app store market and there’s an opportunity for someone like PhonePe, which has amassed over 450 million registered users in the country, to build an alternative app store that is “more localized not just from a language perspective but also from a discovery and consumer interest perspective.” The timing is also “favorable for us,” the firm said, pointing to a recent order from the Indian antitrust watchdog Competition Commission of India that paves the way for other developers to build and launch their app stores on Google Play. A tribunal court has since delivered some relief to Google. PhonePe confirmed that it’s holding multiple conversations with phone makers in India and said “everyone is very receptive, especially since CCI has clarified that Google cannot engage in anti-competitive practices.” “All the OEMs are excited about PhonePe building out a localised App store for the Indian market. We expect to be live on all Android OEMs within the first few months of launch. We have already closed terms with one of the largest OEMs and are trying to get the others rapidly onboard over the next couple of months.” The app store is the latest product push from PhonePe, which recently also entered the e-commerce category. The startup separated from its parent firm Flipkart last year."
547,Kepler Communications closes $92M Series C to grow real-time satellite data relay network,['@breadfrom'],"April 13, 2023","Toronto-based startup Kepler Communications closed another tranche of capital to continue building out its on-orbit data network. The new funding, which comes to $92 million, will be used to launch a constellation of optical communications satellites next year. Those satellites will join Kepler’s existing network of 19 radio-frequency satellites operating in sun-synchronous orbits (SSO). Two more satellites are scheduled to join that constellation with the launch of SpaceX’s Transporter-7 mission next week. According to Kepler’s website, the new optical relay network will deliver data at 2.5 Gbps to satellites in low Earth orbit. The company plans to place the optical communications satellites in “two near-orthogonal planes” in SSO to enable continuous connection. The network infrastructure will act as internet exchange points for in-space data relay, similar to how internet traffic is exchanged on Earth, and enable real-time data relays between spacecraft and to Earth. The new funding was led by IA Ventures, which has been investing in Kepler since its seed round in 2016. Other participating investors include Costanoa Ventures, Canaan Partners, Tribe Capital and BDC Capital’s Industrial Innovation Venture Fund. Kepler’s now raised more than $200 million to date. “Exponentially decreasing launch costs make space more accessible than ever, but connectivity beyond Earth is still costly, challenging, and inconsistent,” IA Ventures general partner Brad Gillespie said in a statement. He added that the network provides connectivity between assets in space and Earth, and “someday to Mars and beyond.” Kepler will launch two satellites this year to test and validate the optical communication technology. In addition to satellites, Kepler operates its own ground stations and in-house satellite production facilities."
548,Google asks court to dismiss multiple claims in Epic Games antitrust trial,['@sarahintampa'],"April 20, 2023","Google is hoping to speed along the resolution of its antitrust legal battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games, Match Group and state attorneys general. In a new filing, Google’s legal team is now asking the court to dismiss several of the plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the nature of its app store business, revenue-sharing agreements and other app store-related projects in a partial motion for summary judgment. According to Google, it believes the court should now have enough information on hand to make determinations on a handful of the plaintiffs’ claims before the case goes to trial, saying that these items are not in violation of antitrust law. If the court agrees with Google’s position, the trial would still move forward as other claims would still need to be argued in court. Google specifically wants the court’s judgment on five key claims which would seemingly be pivotal to the plaintiffs’ ability to prove anticompetitive behavior. It wants the court to dismiss the argument that Google’s Developer Distribution Agreement is illegal because it prohibits the distribution of other app stores. Google counters this by saying it doesn’t have a legal obligation to distribute to other app stores, and notes that most Android devices come preloaded with more than one app store. In addition, it points out that consumers can install additional app stores from the web browser. “Android is the only major mobile platform that allows multiple app stores,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “In fact, most Android devices ship with two or more app stores preinstalled, and consumers can install others. Epic, Match Group and the state Attorneys General ignore the openness and choice Android and Google Play offer, and we look forward to making our case in court,” they added. Another argument it wants dismissed is focused on “Project Hug,” a Google-run program that was designed to incentivize Android game developers to keep their games on the Google Play Store. The plaintiffs argued that Google quietly paid game developers millions of dollars in incentives as part of this initiative, which was later known as the “Apps and Games Velocity Program.” Epic Games alleged the program came about because Google was scared other developers would follow its lead after it exclusively released Fortnite for Android outside the Play Store through its own installer. Supposedly, Google was also worried Epic might strike up other exclusive pre-install deals with OEMs like Samsung to lower its revenue splits. The program itself was fairly successful as Google was able to forge deals with a number of developers, including Activision Blizzard, to keep their games on the Play Store, earlier filings had stated.   Google, however, argues that Project Hug was not an anticompetitive move, but has been mischaracterized by the plaintiffs. It says the program offered developers benefits and early access to Google Play users when developers released new or updated content, but did not prevent developers from creating competing app stores. The company is also pushing back against claims over revenue-sharing agreements with wireless carriers, saying they are outside the statute of limitations. The agreements have been expired for more than four years, Google says, so should be dismissed. In addition, Google claims the AGs and consumer class were unable to show that Google harmed competition by selling app subscriptions and in-app purchases to consumers. For that reason, consumers should not be able to recover any of these alleged overcharges, Google says. The final claim focuses on tying — or the allegation that in order to buy one product, the buyer also had to purchase a different (or tied) product. The plaintiffs argued that Google Play and Google Play’s billing services are illegally tied together, but Google says this isn’t true. Instead, it argues Play’s billing services are not a separate product. It also notes that over 90% of the apps on Google Play are free and developers pay nothing when they are downloaded. The new push for a partial summary judgment follows shortly after last month’s ruling that Google’s failure to preserve some of its messages for discovery requires sanctions. The plaintiffs successfully demonstrated that Google employees tended to switch off chat history on internal discussions, in an effort to destroy sensitive communications related to the case. The DoJ recently cited the same issue in its own antitrust investigation. The judge gave the plaintiffs’ lawyers until April 21 to provide an amount in legal fees they are seeking as part of the sanctions, as a start. Google earlier asked for the trial to be delayed and was denied. Epic Games declined to comment. Updated, 4/21/23, 8:55 am et, with Epic Games’ response."
549,Tesla wins Autopilot crash case in California,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 21, 2023","Tesla scored a victory Friday after a California jury determined the automaker was not to blame for a 2019 crash that involved its advanced driver assistance system, known as Autopilot. The jury awarded no damages to Los Angeles resident Justine Hsu, who sued Tesla in 2020 alleging negligence, fraud and breach of contract. This appears to be the first case involving Autopilot to go to trial. Reuters was the first to report the verdict. Hsu said in her lawsuit that the Tesla Model S she was driving had Autopilot engaged when it turned into and hit a median on a city street. Airbags deployed fracturing her jaw and causing nerve damage, the lawsuit alleged. The jury determined that Tesla was not to blame and the airbag deployed as it should. The court filing also said Tesla properly warned users not to use the system while driving on city streets, which Hsu did. The court ruling provides a win for Tesla as it faces increased scrutiny from federal and state regulators over Autopilot as well as the upgraded versions of the system called Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software. Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver-assistance system branded as Autopilot. For a $6,000 upgrade, owners can purchase Enhanced Autopilot, which includes several other features. For an additional $15,000, owners can buy “full self-driving,” or FSD — a feature that CEO Elon Musk has promised for years will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. Instead, FSD includes a number of automated driving features that still require the driver to be ready to take control at all times. It includes the parking feature Summon, as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. The system is also supposed to handle steering on city streets and recognize and react to traffic lights and stop signs. In February, Tesla paused the rollout of its Full Self-Driving beta software in the United States and Canada following a recall of the system that federal safety regulators warned could allow vehicles to act unsafe around intersections and cause crashes."
550,"Lyft relaunches EV service, starting with business travelers",['@rebeccabellan'],"April 6, 2023","Lyft is relaunching a feature that will allow riders to request an electric or hybrid vehicle for their next pickup. The service, Lyft Green, will initially only be available to business travelers in select cities when it begins April 17. Lyft originally launched Lyft Green in 2019 in Seattle, with plans to scale across other cities, but rolled it back in 2021. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the service was “initially a bit ahead of its time” and that Lyft didn’t see a lot of demand. Now riders have had more exposure to EVs and are more excited about them, so the expansion is Lyft’s first step toward broadly offering the option again in the market, the company said. The relaunch comes a week after Uber expanded its Comfort Electric option, which allows riders to choose a luxury electric vehicle like a Tesla or Audi, to 14 new cities. Comfort Electric is currently available in 40 cities, and Uber also has a more budget-friendly version called Uber Green, where riders can request a hybrid or less flashy EV. Lyft Green is in line with the ride-hailing company’s goal to reach 100% electric vehicles on its platform by 2030, a goal that is partly charged by California’s 2021 ruling that ride-hail trips must be done in EVs by that same year. Lyft will have to make some aggressive changes if it intends to meet that goal. While hybrids have grown in popularity among Lyft drivers, EVs have remained somewhat stagnant. In 2021, the share of vehicle miles driven in an EV was only 0.56%, according to Lyft’s 2022 ESG report. The spokesperson said that Lyft Green wasn’t popular enough back in 2019 to be successful, but it’s possible that there simply weren’t enough EVs on the platform to make it a viable service. For comparison, 4.1% of Uber’s trip miles have been completed with electric vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. Last December, Lyft introduced options to help drivers switch to EVs, including discounts on charging and expanded EV inventory for the company’s so-called Express Drive rental program. The company also offered California drivers an extra $150 per week if they give 50 rides in their personal EVs until the end of 2024. A Lyft spokesperson said that Lyft Green rides cost $1 more than standard rides, and that dollar is split between the driver and Lyft. To get drivers to make the switch to EVs, Uber has been offering drivers $1 per trip completed with an EV, capping out at $4,000, and works with rental companies to give its drivers discounts on EVs. As Lyft works to get more drivers on its platform driving EVs, it will trial the Lyft Green program initially with business travelers, who will need to sign up for a Lyft business profile using their work email. This is the second of Lyft’s business-focused initiatives this year. In January, the company launched a new reporting tool to help businesses track their emissions using the platform. Lyft Green is currently available in Portland and will expand into 14 markets, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Boston, New York City, Chicago, San Diego, Washington, D.C., Austin, Denver, Orange County, Sacramento and Phoenix. As the company improves the service, it expects to open the service beyond just business travelers. Lyft recently announced a new CEO, David Risher, who will take over on April 17, the same day Lyft Green launches. Lyft’s co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer stepped down from their positions of CEO and president, respectively. Risher’s plan for Lyft is to focus on the core ride-hailing business in an attempt to gain back more market share from Uber."
551,3 ways to step up your short-form video and TikTok growth strategy,['@jon4growth'],"April 17, 2023","Video content is king. There’s no denying the dramatic increase in video consumption across the globe. According to InVideo, individual internet consumers spent an hour and 40 minutes per day watching videos in 2022. TikTok, in combination with COVID-19 lockdowns that began in 2020, created a perfect storm for the endless scrolling of quick entertaining and informative video content. What we in the industry didn’t know in those early days was whether short-form video content was here to stay once the lockdowns ended. It is my argument that short-form video is here to stay and in a big way. Today it is more important than ever to prioritize short-form video content along with having some form of presence on TikTok or one of its major competitors. The fact that influencers are moving their strategies to shorter-form content is a clear signal for startups to follow suit. It can be tedious and time consuming to build out your short-form content as a startup founder, so I’ve distilled it down to three easy steps: The easiest path for creating your short-form video strategy is to look at what your competitors or top brands are doing. They have likely given their content a good amount of thought, and if you’re stalking bigger brands, you can certainly be assured that many resources went toward their strategies. If you’re in the supplement space and want to look outside of direct competitors, search for #supplements, #vitamins and other relevant hashtags to get content ideas from creators as well. At Coinbase, I had many strategic syncs between the internal team along with bringing in outside creative agency talent that helped us formulate content and ad ideas. One of the creative agencies I worked with only made TikTok short-form content, and they prided themselves on being up to speed on the latest trends and styles. Once you have a list of content pillars you’d like to use, create a doc outlining exactly what you want for each video. You’ll want to have bulleted pointers that you’d like creator talent to touch on, the setting and format of the video (i.e., lighting, selfie-style, etc.) and any ending call-to-action. From there, it’s time to find and hire talent that can shoot these videos for you. This is where creator marketplaces such as Billo or Backstage will help speed the process of finding talent, collaborating with them and managing payments. These marketplaces keep it very simple for finding the right demographic of talent that fits your consumers’ persona. While creating content for TikTok, it’s imperative to think about how to best optimize for SEO because of growing search trends on the social platform. A recent Pew Research Center study found that ~40% of Generation Z prefer researching topics on TikTok over Google. Let that sink in."
552,"Snapchat’s AI chatbot is now free for all global users, says the AI will later ‘Snap’ you back",['@sarahintampa'],"April 19, 2023","Snapchat’s AI chatbot is now opening up to a global audience, the company announced today at its Snap Partner Summit. Initially launched in February, the feature originally allowed Snapchat’s paid subscribers to chat with an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology directly in its app. Now it will be available for free. To date, users have sent nearly 2 million messages per day using the chatbot, Snap noted. With today’s global expansion, the feature is also being upgraded with new functionality, including the ability to add My AI to group chats, get recommendations for places on Snap Map and Lenses, and share Snaps with My AI and receive chat replies. Later, My AI will be able to respond with unique “generative” Snaps back, instead of just chat replies, the company also said, to keep the visual conversation going. The idea to integrate AI into the Snapchat app was originally intended to give users another way to engage in the app while taking advantage of the growing consumer demand for ChatGPT-like experiences. The company suggested the feature could be used to do things like suggest birthday gift ideas for a BFF, plan a hiking trip, suggest dinner recipes or write a poem for a friend, among other things. Image Credits: Snap (modified by TechCrunch) Image Credits: Snap (modified by TechCrunch) Unfortunately for Snap, the AI soon went off the rails. Only days after its debut, The Washington Post reported the bot was responding in an unsafe manner. Despite telling the bot the user was a young teen, aged 15, the bot made suggestions about how to mask the smell of alcohol and pot at a birthday party. It also wrote an essay for school for the teen. When the bot was told the user was 13, it responded to a question about how to set the mood when having sex for the first time. Snap, in response, said users had been trying to “trick the chatbot into providing responses that do not conform to our guidelines,” and rolled out new tools including age filters to keep the AI responses more age-appropriate. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap It also said it would introduce insights into its Family Center parental controls hub that helps parents and guardians stay informed about their kids’ interactions with the bot. As of today’s global launch, Snap has still not done so and hasn’t indicated when the Family Center controls would go live, only noting they were still in the works. Image Credits: Snap (modified by TechCrunch) Image Credits: Snap (modified by TechCrunch) In the meantime, the company is making the chatbot more appealing to younger users by allowing it into group chats with friends, where it can be added with an @ mention. Here, the bot will enter the chat with a sparkle next to its name to make it clear it’s a bot and not another group member. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap The AI will also be able to suggest place recommendations or relevant Lenses. For instance, it could suggest weekend activities or a good Lens to use to wish a friend happy birthday, Snap says. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap And it can now reply to your Snaps with a chat reply and later, it will be able to generate a visual response. The feature will be limited to Snapchat+ subscribers, however, even though My AI itself will now be free to use. During today’s Partner Summit presentation, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel suggested that users who snapped a photo of their dog might get a funny dog photo back as a generative response, for example. Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap “Or if you send a Snap of the vegetables growing in your garden, My AI might recommend a recipe,” he added. “We can’t wait to see how our community embraces my AI.” Image Credits: Snap Image Credits: Snap It’s not clear what sort of safety controls will be involved in the generative aspects. This could be another concern, as other generative AI apps, like Lensa AI, had been easily tricked into making NSFW images. Other new personalization features will be introduced, too, including the ability to name your AI and create a custom Bitmoji for it to give your My AI more of an identity. The feature, before today, was available only to Snapchat+ $3.99 per month subscription holders, which could be helping drive upgrades. Snap today also said that Snapchat+ now has more than 3 million subscribers. However, the AI will now be broadly available, with specific AI features being a paid upgrade. Note: The article was updated during Snap’s live event to indicate the new My AI pricing structure of free for all, paid access to future generative AI features. "
553,South Korea fines Google $32M for blocking developers from releasing games on rival’s platform  ,['@kateparknews'],"April 11, 2023","South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has fined Alphabet’s Google 42.1 billion won (~ $32 million) for blocking developers from releasing mobile video games on a Korean competitor platform called One Store. On Tuesday, the KFTC said that Google allegedly required Korean video game companies to exclusively release their new games in the Play Store from June 2016 to April 2018. That means Google banned the local game makers from releasing their content on One Store in return for offering Google’s in-app exposure and further support for global expansion.  One Store, a local peer of Google’s Play Store, was founded in June 2016 by South Korea’s three telcos — SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus — and internet giant Naver.  Google’s local market share in the mobile Android app market increased to approximately 90% to 95% in 2018, up from around 80% to 85% in 2016, while One Store’s market share accounted for about 5% to 10% in 2018, which fell from 15% to 20% in 2016, per the data compiled by the KFTC.  Korea’s antitrust watchdog said the move is part of an effort to ensure fair competition in the app market by preventing the U.S. tech giant from abusing its dominant position.  Google Play and One Store generate more than 90% of domestic sales from selling games, according to the KFTC press release. Google’s activity affected the gaming companies, from large video game makers such as NCSoft, Netmarble and Nexon to small and mid-sized game developers, the KFTC said.   “We have cooperated diligently with the KFTC’s investigation and deliberation process for the past five years and believe that there has been no violation of the law,” a spokesperson at Google said in an emailed statement. “Google makes substantial investments in the success of developers, and we respectfully disagree with the KFTC’s conclusions. We will carefully review the final written decision once it’s shared with us to evaluate the next course of action.” In 2021, the KFTC fined Google $177 million for abusing its market dominance in the Android operating system (OS) market. Google claims it has contributed to the growth and successful global expansion of the Korean mobile game developers that have launched their games on Play over the last decade.   "
554,Fetcherr raises $12.5M to dynamically price airfare with algorithms,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 4, 2023","Roy Cohen believes that there’s a severe underinvestment in tech within the airline industry, with airlines continuing to rely on legacy systems and outdated infrastructures that date back decades. Coming from the e-commerce industry, Cohen felt that airlines weren’t making the most of emerging technologies, particularly AI, which he thought had the potential to bolster profits while cutting costs. It’s these perceptions that led Cohen to co-found Fetcherr, a platform that attempts to optimize prices for airfare using AI algorithms. Fetcherr today closed a $12.5 million funding round led by Left Lane Capital with participation from M-Fund, binging the company’s total raised to $31 million across equity and debt. Cohen, who co-founded Fetcherr in 2019 alongside Shimi Avizmil, Uri Yerushalmi and Robby Nissan and serves as the company’s CEO, says that the company will put the funds toward supporting business development and market expansion and growing its U.S. presence. (Fetcherr is based in Tel Aviv.) “Traditional revenue management systems that currently exist are fragmented and not able to keep up with volatility, rising demand, changing consumer behaviors, manpower issues and more,” Cohen told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Fetcherr predicts demand using real-time, sophisticated models and automatically provides pricing recommendations.” Fetcherr, which counts Azul Airlines among its customers, predicts and prices airfare using algorithms tailored to each airline’s demographic. Cohen says that the algorithms are trained on “several years” of bookings, flight schedules, availability, fares, events, weather, capital markets and “other macroeconomic and microeconomic data points taken from global markets and various verticals.” Once Fetcherr trains an algorithm, it uses it to predict purchasing behavior in the air travel market within the context of an airline customer’s business. Powered by the algorithm, the Fetcherr platform essentially simulates flights and seats being sold by a given carrier. A mockup of Fetcherr’s software. Image Credits: Fetcherr A mockup of Fetcherr’s software. Image Credits: Fetcherr Using algorithms to predict pricing certainly isn’t a new idea. There’s vendors like Pricefx, which take into account factors like customer survey data and segments, competitor data, operating costs, inventories and historical pricing to help companies price products. But dynamic pricing — particularly pricing powered by unpredictable, prone-to-economic-shocks algorithms — isn’t always well-received by the air traveling public. Harvard Business Review relates the story of how United Airlines replaced its frequent flier mileage tables with an algorithmic pricing model, which resulted in higher award prices for high-demand flights — leading to pushback. More problematic is the mounting evidence that algorithmic pricing can lead to unfair discrimination between consumers and encourage what Financial Times’ John Thornhill calls “implicit collusion” between firms, raising prices overall. Companies with sophisticated pricing algorithms tend to instantly match their rivals’ price cuts, giving competitors with inferior technology no incentive to lower prices. Cohen, for his part, paints Fetcherr as a net good for airline carriers (but not necessarily customers), arguing that the platform can save manpower by updating fares across different channels and predicting demand “in volatile times.” “Fetcherr aims to disrupt traditional, rule-based legacy revenue systems through deep learning methodologies, beginning with the airline industry,” he added. “We’re able to seamlessly incorporate our technology into all existing systems, offering a zero-risk onboarding that doesn’t interfere with airline’s current IT infrastructure and enables airlines to seamlessly migrate outdated infrastructure into a complete cloud-based retailing environment and a user-centric customizable dashboard.” That’s a lot to promise. We’ll have to see if Fetcherr lives up to it."
555,"50+ ISPs, NGOs and broadcaster groups hit out at ‘Big Telco bias’ driving anti-competitive EU network fee proposal",['@riptari'],"May 3, 2023","A coalition of more than 50 European consumer and digitals rights groups, smaller ISPs and broadcasters have inked their name to a joint statement urging EU policymakers and Member States to reject a controversial network fee proposal being lobbied for by major telcos in the region. They suggest any move to legislative for a mechanism that funnels direct payments to telecom incumbents would have “immediate and wide-ranging” negative consequences for European businesses and consumer interest — arguing it would hit consumer costs and choice by damaging the diversity and quality of products and services available online, as well as harming competition. “The risks of introducing network fees are many but ultimately the biggest threats would be to consumer rights, costs, and freedom of choice,” they warn. “Users of the internet and mobile networks are the key players in the debate, not content providers. Consumers access content (and thus drive internet traffic and take-up), so the fee would effectively be a fee on consumer behaviour and choice.” Signatories to the statement run the gamut from civil society groups such as Access Now, BEUC, EDRi and the EFF, alongside ISPs like Level7, Link Broadband, and Total Wireless, plus broadcaster groups and publishers such as the Sports Rights Owner Coalition, Motion Picture Association, and Wikimedia Europe, to name a few.   Major European telcos, meanwhile, want regional lawmakers to let them extract a network fee from Big Tech platforms whose popular services they claim are responsible for generating the most traffic across their fixed and mobile networks — spinning the ask to double dip (given consumers already paid them for connectivity), such as getting tech giants like Meta and Netflix to contribute what they dub a “fair share” toward funding network infrastructure costs. While the likes of Meta have pushed back, saying that such a fee would actually be arbitrary and unfair. Thing is, the European Commission, which is responsible for drafting EU legislative proposals, has been sounding suspiciously sympathetic to Big Telco’s lobbying. Back in February, internal market commissioner Thierry Breton appeared onstage at a major industry confab, MWC in Barcelona, where Big Telco gathers annually to hype the next flavor of connectivity, to personally evangelize the “Web 4.0” “connectivity revolution” he suggested would be speeding down carriers’ pipes. Simultaneously, Breton questioned the “traditional model of vertical integration” — telling conference delegates: “We will need to find a financing model for the huge investments needed that respects and preserves the fundamental elements of our European acquis,” and signposting the existence of an exploratory consultation on funding future networks the Commission had launched mere days before. (BTW: The deadline for contributions to this consultation is now just a few weeks away, on May 19.) While the Commission maintains no decisions have been taken on how the bloc should evolve funding mechanisms for internet connectivity to ensure infrastructure upgrades enable the next wave of disruptive digital services — saying it wants to take a comprehensive look to consider how best to proceed — signatories to the statement are concerned the process is biased in favor of Big Telco. “We welcome the European Commission’s decision to only launch an exploratory consultation on the matter, and many of us intend to submit contributions. That being said, we fear that the process could lead to misleading conclusions on the need for and consequences of a network fee,” they write. “This fear seems to be shared by other stakeholders: leading MEPs have already publicly called this consultation ‘biased’ because of its assumptions and structure, which do not allow all stakeholders to contribute in an equal way (i.e. civil society, consumers, academia compared to ECNs and CAPs).” The coalition also argues there is no evidence of the need for such an extraordinary network fee, claiming: “The concept of the contribution stems from large internet providers proposing a favourable solution for a problem that has not been identified, justified nor clarified. This ‘solution’ would harm and discriminate against every other part of European business and consumer good, to the single benefit only of large telecom providers.” They also raise antitrust concerns, suggesting additional payments made direct to telco incumbents would only crank up the “profitability gap” that already exists between traditional telecom operators versus smaller alternative operators and MVNOs; and versus other content services providers that rely on telcos’ networks to provide “vital competition and choice for consumers,” as their statement puts it. The prospect of the Commission taking steps to cement Big Telco’s grip on connectivity does seems at odds with recent moves by the Commission to regulate Big Tech’s market muscle, under the incoming Digital Markets Act — lending weight to a critique of pro-telco bias in the upper echelons of the EU’s executive. Six parliamentarians (including five MEPs) have also co-signed a separate statement today supporting the coalition’s concerns over “the Commission’s approach on the network fees.” The lawmakers also warn the proposal “risks unprecedented impacts to net neutrality, to the health of competition and content, as well as to consumer welfare, choice and costs.” While Thomas Lohninger, from the digital rights NGO epicenter.works (another signatory to the coalition statement), takes direct aim at Breton, writing in another supporting statement, “Never in the last decade has the European Commission appeared so captured by special interests and shown such disrespect for its own due diligence principles. Former France Telecom CEO and current commissioner Thierry Breton seems determined to sacrifice consumer choice, competition and the open internet for the profits of the telecom industry.” So, er, ouch! We’ve reached out to the Commission for a response to the claims of bias and the wider concerns raised about the network fee proposal. “The threat to competition is even more obvious if we consider the Commission’s proposed Recommendation on regulatory promotion of Gigabit connectivity, published alongside the exploratory consultation,” the 50+ signatories on the joint statement go on. “European alternative operators’ have already warned that the draft Recommendation would have ‘detrimental impacts on competition, on the EU internal market and on consumers’ interests,’ due to its focus on ‘increasing the profitability of ex-monopoly telecom operators’ (via lighter price control obligations). The pattern is thus clear — as is the risk of disproportionately enhancing the power of telecom incumbents, whether by deregulation or via direct contributions.” “In light of all this, we ask European policymakers and Member States to stand against imposing direct payment obligations in favour of the largest telecom operators. The current system is sustainable, built on the shared success on telecom operators, content distribution and consumer choice,” they add. “We also call on the EU Commission and Regulatory Scrutiny Board to duly apply Better Regulation principles throughout the whole process. Any type of policymaking should always be based on evidence, involve all relevant stakeholders (incl. citizens and businesses) and follow a thorough, comprehensive impact assessment. There should not and cannot be any shortcuts on this.” Update: A Commission spokesperson has now responded, sending the following response: First, we would like to clarify that the Commission’ current exploratory consultation is neither a  Commission “proposal”, nor a Commission “initiative” nor does it indicate any “Commission approach” on any of the topics it touches upon. The consultation has a broad objective of identifying Europe’s needs in terms of connectivity infrastructure to lead the digital transformation and tackles several topics, such as spectrum and single market for telecoms, which may need to be addressed to ensure this infrastructure can be delivered. We need to increase investments for more modern and more resilient networks across the EU. This is to the benefit of EU citizens and businesses which rely on connectivity to provide their services. As part of this broad reflection the consultation touches upon the issue of a fair and proportional contribution to the costs of public goods, services and infrastructures. This is a complex issue and any decision should be made by understanding the underlying facts and figures. The exploratory consultation will gather input also to evaluate whether other players should contribute to telecoms’ networks’ costs. Gathering information on this issue is in line with the 2030 Digital Decade policy programme and the Declaration on digital rights and principles, which contain the aim that “all market actors benefiting from the digital transformation should assume their social responsibilities and make a fair and proportionate contribution to the public goods, services and infrastructures, for the benefit of all Europeans.” The spokesperson also reiterated a prior claim that: “Reopening EU net neutrality rules has never been in question,” adding: “The Commission has made a strong commitment to protecting a neutral and open internet where content, services, and applications are not unjustifiably blocked or degraded, in Europe as well as on the global stage. This is enshrined in the Open Internet Regulation, and it is also one of the fundamental principles in the “European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade”, by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission.”    "
556,African climate startups set to gain ground as VC funding shifts their way,['@annienjanja'],"April 15, 2023","Venture capital activity around climate tech has been heating up in Africa despite the global VC funding cooldown. The continent’s climate tech startups secured over $860 million in equity funding, largely driven by clean energy technologies, representing 3.5x growth amid macroeconomic headwinds last year, data shows, making climate Africa’s most funded sector after fintech. This seems to be just the beginning: The past few months have seen a slew of new funds dedicated to investing in the space, indicating that funding for climate tech startups will persist for a while. Pan-African venture firm Novastar was last week reported to be raising over $200 million for its third fund, Africa People + Planet Fund, which will invest in startups developing agriculture and climate solutions on the continent. Around the same time, climate tech venture capital firm Equator announced the initial close of its fund to back seed and Series A startups in the energy, agriculture and mobility sectors. Catalyst Fund’s new climate-focused $30 million kitty has also hit the ground running and is now investing in its first cohort of startups. Satgana, a new climate tech firm launched late last year, plans to allocate up to 40% of its funds in “planet-positive” startups in Africa. Other African climate-focused investment vehicles that have raised capital recently include the $250 million AfricaGoGreen Fund (AAGF), which closed the second tranche of its fundraise in February, and the Energy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund (EEGF), which raised over $110 million last year. The AAGF finances “climate-friendly” projects and counts pay-as-you-go solar providers BBOXX and Solarise as part of its portfolio. Similarly, the Shell-backed EEGF fund invests in startups that increase access to clean and reliable energy to households and businesses on the continent. Oxfam Novib and Goodwell have also launched a new fund to provide venture debt to startups in this space. The rise of so many new funds shows that even amid the capital crunch, there will be some dedicated pools for founders building startups that can lead energy-transition efforts and offer solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. The timing of the funding couldn’t be better."
557,HomePods can now send a notification when your smoke alarm goes off,['@bheater'],"April 18, 2023","Apple’s surprise January resurrection of the original HomePod arrived with a handful of new software features. One of the more intriguing of the bunch was sound recognition for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. When the smart speaker hears the alarm, it will send a notification to your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch. It’s a nice addition for those who don’t own a connected detector, adding peace of mind when you’re not home. The feature is finally available starting today for HomePod and HomePod mini owners, accessible via the Home app. Once set up, it will serve the notification up on the iPhone lock screen and in the Home app. If your system is connected to a smart camera, it will also present video of your place, so you can see what’s going on in real time. Apple notes that the feature is end-to-end encrypted, and all of the sound recognition is happening locally on the speaker, instead of the cloud. The feature is similar to Alexa Guard, which Amazon announced for Echo devices back in 2019. That feature also includes alerts for the sound of breaking glass, which seems like an easy enough addition to implement down the road, should Apple see fit. For what it’s worth, I’ve been a big Nest Protect fan for years now. It’s the one absolutely must-have smart home device for someone like me who is . . . let’s just say prone to concern about such things when not at home. It’s the one thing I recommend for most people, but alarm detection built into a smart speaker is a useful workaround for everyone else."

559,Bishop Fox lays off employees days after throwing conference party,"['Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai', 'Zack Whittaker']","May 3, 2023","Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox laid off around 50 employees — or 13% of its workforce — on Tuesday, the company told TechCrunch. The layoffs come just a few days after the company threw a party at the cybersecurity conference RSA, where the company apparently served branded drinks that it called “cyber soup.” Bishop Fox’s official Twitter account said last week that the company will have “other events in Vegas later this year,” referring to the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences held every year in Las Vegas. Bishop Fox spokesperson Kevin Kosh said in an email that the company had an event space at RSA “reserved many months in advance and was primarily secured for the purposes of the day-long livestream (mirroring the one we did for DefCon), which was a forum to engage, and share knowledge with the larger community. The reception followed that for the participants, team, industry friends and RSA attendees.” The company declined to say how much it spent on the RSA party. Kosh confirmed that the company had around 400 employees before the layoffs yesterday. Last night was so much fun! Thanks to everyone who hung out with us after our #RSAC #BFLive event at @HotelZeppelin, and experienced the #ArtOfCyber with us! Where to next? Maybe … Vegas this summer? 🥳#RSAConference #RSAC2023 pic.twitter.com/NTSoZMDD5n — Bishop Fox (@bishopfox) April 27, 2023  “We proactively made these changes in response to the global economic situation and opportunities we identified to make our business more efficient. While demand for our solutions remains solid and our business is stable, we can’t ignore the market uncertainty and investment trends in this very different global economy,” Bishop Fox CEO Vinnie Liu said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “Bishop Fox remains healthy, and we continue to be bullish about our growth and technology investments over the coming quarters and years. Our firm’s cash reserves (including our Series B raise), combined with this restructuring, allow us to maintain a strong financial position that enables scale, innovation, and of course, delivery of the high-quality solutions our customers have come to expect.” Last year, Bishop Fox raised a total of $129 million in a Series B round from several investors, including WestCap, NextEquity Partners and Rockpool Capital. And last week, the company announced at RSA that it was expanding to the U.K. with “an initial focus on organizations in Northern Europe.” In the announcement, the company also said that it had “a 40% year-over-year company growth.” Employees who said they lost their job on Twitter called the layoffs “unexpected.” One of them said it was “due to internal restructuring.” In September 2022, the company’s vice president of customer success Christie Terrill said the company was “hiring across the board,” and the company’s official LinkedIn account wrote in a post that it was “hiring across several different teams in the Fox Den, from pentesting to technical editing to sales.” The layoffs at Bishop Fox come as the whole tech sector is suffering from the economic downturn. Still, some considered cybersecurity to be a safer sector. Last year, a report from (ISC)², a nonprofit association for “information security leaders,” predicted that cybersecurity teams “will be the least affected by staff reductions, as organizations anticipate an increase in cyber threats in 2023.” The report was based on a poll of 1,000 C-suite executives. At the time, (ISC)² chief executive Clar Rosso said that “the importance placed on cybersecurity professionals, even during uncertain economic times, suggests that top executives understand the critical need for a strong cybersecurity team now more than ever.” Do you have more information about the layoffs at Bishop Fox?

560,How Aurora is navigating the bumpy road to commercial self-driving trucks,['@tim_stevens'],"April 24, 2023","Amid economic uncertainty, tight capital markets, wary investors and consolidation in the nascent autonomous vehicle industry, Aurora Innovation is still motoring on toward its target of commercializing self-driving trucks by 2024, ticking off waypoints and milestones along the way. It’s even managed to rack up a few wins in the past year, including launching or expanding pilot programs with FedEx, Ryder, Schneider and Uber Freight. More recently, Aurora announced its self-driving system is “feature complete” — industry jargon that means the technology has all the capabilities required for hauling freight autonomously on public roads. And it deployed the first of its “commercial ready” autonomous shipping terminals in Palmer, Texas, infrastructure needed if the company’s trucks are going to be on the road 24 hours of every day of the year. Three years ago, it wasn’t so clear if Aurora would survive its ambitious and risky moves. In late 2020, Uber sold its self-driving unit Uber ATG to Aurora in a complex deal that would bolster the startup’s valuation to $10 billion along with its autonomy efforts, while giving Uber a 26% stake in the company. The deal liberated Uber from what had been a troubling development path, including a 2017 lawsuit from Waymo for trade secret theft and patent infringement (which Uber settled in 2018), as well as the 2018 fatal crash involving an Uber ATG autonomous test vehicle. But while Aurora gained talented engineers it also faced the tricky process of integrating about 1,200 former Uber ATG employees into its operations. Six months later, Aurora would make another leap: This time into the public markets through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, an increasingly fraught path that has stymied many other automotive startups. Aurora’s stock has suffered along with other mobility SPACs; its stock price debuted November 4, 2021 at $11.25 a share. Aurora stock has fallen 85% since then and was trading Monday at $1.46 a share. “I think that there is a kind of best house in a bad neighborhood kind of sentiment. That there’s a lot of stuff that’s maybe not going as well in this space, right? Some very public failures and backstepping,” co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson said in a recent interview. “But, you know, I think that’s short term. A short-term issue because as we continue to demonstrate progress and execution and the fact that we made strategic bets years ago that are paying off, right? That we expect that that will be recognized and, you know, things will move forward.” Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson. Image Credits: Aurora Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson. Image Credits: Aurora Aurora is now encountering another batch of challenges as it drives toward commercialization, from assuaging shareholders and its growing list of partners to navigating regulatory hurdles in California and raising more money. And despite that “feature complete” achievement, Aurora still has plenty of testing to do, including ramping up to haul 100 loads per week between Dallas and Houston by the end of this year. The company has more than 30 trucks on the road in Texas today hauling goods with more than 50 trips a week. To date, the company’s trucks have traveled more than 400,000 miles and hauled 20 million pounds of freight for FedEx, Uber Freight, Werner and Schneider. Screenshot of Aurora trucking route as of April 2023. Image Credits: Aurora Screenshot of Aurora trucking route as of April 2023. Image Credits: Aurora If all goes according to plan, Aurora will deploy its self-driving system called Driver commercially in Texas, without onboard human supervision, by the end of 2024. According to Urmson, his company’s autonomy tech will fix what he calls a “systemic problem” in the U.S. supply chain: “There’s not enough people willing to drive trucks. We’re short about 80,000. We expect to be short about 150,000 by the end of the decade.” The trucking industry also suffers from a whopping 90% turnover rate, and its workers must abide by federal 11-hour daily limits behind the wheel. Urmson says that the Aurora driver should be able to keep a truck moving for about 20 hours on an average day and that, plus associated fuel savings and reduced insurance costs due to safer driving, means theoretically doubling the revenue per truck for a fleet operator. “Getting from Houston to LA, for example, takes about three days by truck today, because of that 11 hours of service limitation. The Aurora Driver should be able to make that trip in 24 hours,” Urmson said. An Aurora Innovation truck drives over a bridge in Texas. Image Credits: Aurora An Aurora Innovation truck drives over a bridge in Texas. Image Credits: Aurora Those increased efficiencies and subsequent reduced costs are crucial to the appeal of Aurora’s technology to the trucking industry. But, there’s one ugly fly threateningly buzzing around the soup: California’s AB 316. If passed, this bill would require human operators in trucks within the state of California, and could kick off similar legislation elsewhere. While Urmson hopes that California will “see the economic and safety benefits” of autonomous trucking and allow driverless operation, Aurora is prepared for an eventuality where it becomes law: “It’ll mean helping our customers haul freight between Arizona and the East Coast,” Urmson said. In other words: no business in California. If policies like this gain momentum, that trend could pose a threat to Aurora’s business plan. “It would certainly be if we ended up with kind of a checkerboard across the United States,” Urmson said. “But, I think in practice that’s unlikely.” For now, Aurora’s primary goals are validating the functionality of its Driver within the state of Texas and doing everything it can to cut costs. Urmson told TechCrunch that the ATG acquisition has helped on both fronts. With ATG, Aurora went from 600 to 1,800 employees “overnight,” and Urmson says they’re still operating with about 1,700. While some Uber ATG employees chose to leave after the deal was closed, Urmson said none were made redundant: “The ones who want to be here are, and that’s really all we can hope for, right?” At this point, the teams are well integrated, according to Urmson, but it was something of a painful process. “We were very deferential around the culture on both sides. And I think that just led to confusion,” Urmson said, with conflicting lines of reporting and duplicated efforts. “Like any organization, there’s pockets of challenges, but I think that, again, those folks that were united in the mission of let’s go get the vehicles on the road, let’s do something that’s going to change the world, they fit in really well.” The Uber ATG deal also helped Aurora become more efficient and cut costs with the goal of extending the company’s runway in the lead-up to commercialization. For instance, Urmson said that ATG’s batch processing of cloud computing was far more efficient than how Aurora was previously handling distributed tasks. “As you can imagine, for all of our ML [machine learning] stuff, all of our testing and simulation, there’s a massive amount of cloud orchestration that happens,” Urmson said. Using ATG’s batching process, Aurora’s distributed systems team was able to take disparate cloud requests and lump them together into fewer, larger requests, saving time and reducing costs. “That’s been really powerful and it’s the heart of what we use today,” Urmson said, estimating the cost savings there alone to be in the “tens of millions of dollars.” On the functional side, ATG’s offline Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) procedure has Aurora generating high-res maps more efficiently. ATG’s sampling-based motion planning has been integrated to help the Aurora Driver in emergency, near-collision situations. The Aurora Driver’s behavior in construction zones also derives from ATG algorithms. All of this is included in the Aurora Driver Beta 6.0 release, which “introduced the final driving capabilities needed to commercially haul freight without vehicle operators,” according to Aurora. That commercial launch, Urmson says, is still on target for next year, and those cost-cutting measures have ensured Aurora will have enough cash to get the company through the middle of 2024. Aurora is now focused on converting all of those pilot programs into long-term customers. The company will host its first customer summit at the end of April in Dallas — an event that will bring together its pilot customers and partners to discuss the next steps toward commercial launch, according to the company. However, another raise is still in the plans. On April 6, Aurora filed for a proposed mixed shelf offering to raise $350 million. “We have not been shy about the fact we would need to raise additional capital in the future,” an Aurora spokesperson told TechCrunch when asked about the filing. “This is a standard filing that provides Aurora the flexibility to raise at a future date but is not a signal we intend to imminently fundraise.” In the meantime, Urmson said he is focused on de-risking the business. “We’re going to wait for the right time and the right partners. What we see is, as a company, we look at these milestones, and our execution against them, and we see them as major moments of de-risking our business,” Urmson said. Reducing risk and inspiring confidence now is key, particularly in the wake of widespread consolidation throughout the industry that has left some investors wary. The abrupt termination of Argo AI last year has left many questioning the future of autonomy as a business. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s self-driving unit Waymo laid off staff in January. The company says its trucking effort, Waymo Via, is still operational with testing occurring in Texas. (Urmson previously led the former Google self-driving project.) “I think one of the really important early decisions we made as a company was to be independent,” Urmson said, referencing Argo AI’s funding by Ford and Volkswagen. “As a company, we have a mission to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly and broadly,” he said. “We work with amazing partners, but for none of them is that their mission.” For Urmson, that misalignment between Argo’s quest for autonomy and its corporate parents’ need for profitability ultimately sealed Argo’s fate during tough economic times. Until things improve, Urmson continues to drive home the importance of frugality on his team: “At each of our all-hands, we have a section we call ‘Every Little Bit Matters’ and we highlight places where teams across the company have saved between thousands and millions of dollars by either not doing something or finding a less expensive way to do it. I think that is a muscle that will serve us well, even when economic times become better.”"
561,"HUSSLUP, a LinkedIn for the entertainment biz, launches web app in beta",['@laurenforristal'],"April 20, 2023","HUSSLUP, currently an invite-only beta, is a job search and networking app for creative professionals in the media and entertainment industry to connect with studios and production companies looking to hire talent. Today, the company announced a web version of its mobile app. It will roll out widely next week. Much like LinkedIn, HUSSLUP allows users to write posts, network with others and search for gigs. However, instead of being targeted to the general public, the app aims to be a central hub for creative professionals in the entertainment industry, above or below the line, to collaborate on a project, promote an upcoming movie/TV show, invite others to an event, find new talent and more. Other community tools include the ability to create a group, share encrypted creative samples, chat via in-app messenger and create annotated contact lists for each project, movie or show. In tandem with the web launch, the company also introduced new web-based features called “Pro Search,” a proprietary feature that allows for more in-depth searches, and “Serendipity Mode,” a Tinder-like section on the platform where users can quickly connect with other members. Image Credits: HUSSLUP Image Credits: HUSSLUP The new ProSearch tools provide a way for staffers to look up talent based on specific criteria, such as their credit level, representation, go-to genre/project types, availability, locations where they’re willing to work, professional affiliations and more. Users can also save potential hires to a list, where they can then add comments, note which person they hired and share with others. Notably, the tool also allows users to sort search results to discover diverse hires. HUSSLUP claims that approximately 65% of its current membership self-identifies as diverse in at least one of the following categories: gender, race and LGBTQ+. The industry continues to be criticized for underrepresentation, so HUSSLUP’s new feature is a significant addition to its toolbox. Among the top 200 highest-grossing theatrical releases at the North American box office in 2022, people of color (POC) made up only 22% of lead actors, 17% of directors and 12% of writers, per UCLA’s 2023 Hollywood Diversity Report. Web users are also getting “Serendipity Mode,” a feature that lets them “swipe” — or, in this case, click right or left with their mouse — on tiles that feature profiles of members, companies and communities. The cards are organized randomly to give users a better chance of discovering a wide range of people. In the future, the company plans to launch more web-based features, H Schuster, founder of HUSSLUP, told TechCrunch. This includes “Project Rosters,” a feature that would enable users to take a list of their hires and generate call sheets, anonymized statistical reports for tax incentives and more. HUSSLUP also intends to create a text, image and video search tool as well as AI-powered recommendations. Image Credits: HUSSLUP Image Credits: HUSSLUP Unlike the majority of professions, there’s no rule book for how to get a career in entertainment. Most of the time, you either have connections in the right places, luck is on your side that week or — if you’re fortunate enough — you’re a nepo baby. Hence HUSSLUP’s tagline, “Transforming Hollywood from clique to click.” Schuster founded HUSSLUP as a potential solution to this ongoing clique problem — “the antiquated game of telephone,” as she and her team like to call it. An executive producer with 20 years of experience in Hollywood, Schuster has worked on reality shows like “MasterChef” and “The Biggest Loser,” and knows all too well how frustrating it can be to find new talent. “When I was sitting behind the desk of hiring, you know, I would literally make five or ten phone calls to colleagues, friends, a manager, agent, and get five or ten names,” Schuster told TechCrunch. “You don’t know these people, so you’re then trying to get their credits on IMDb and their creative samples on YouTube… It’s super painful and disaggregated, and it can take a really long time to find someone who’s available and then vet them.” “There has to be a more efficient way and also a more joyful way, frankly, for creative talent to first of all have a place to aggregate all of their professional information and build a profile that really allows them to tell the story of themselves and present themselves to the industry the way they want to be seen,” she added.

Image Credits: HUSSLUP All the profiles on HUSSLUP have verified credits to ensure everyone on the app has worked in the industry at some point. About 75% of HUSSLUP users are at least mid-career, Schuster claims, ranging from directors, writers, producers, editors, animators, composers, music supervisors, art directors and more. However, once the app exits beta, the company wants to eventually invite students and recent graduates who are still looking to break into the industry. HUSSLUP is currently working with a number of universities. The company also partners with numerous production companies, studios and organizations, including Universal Studio Group, Universal Pictures, Blumhouse, Will Smith-founded Westbrook, the Russo Brothers’ AGBO, Tyra Banks’ Bankable Productions, Don Cheadle’s This Radicle Act and Women in Film, among others. In December 2022, HUSSLUP raised a $2.5 million seed round, led by f7 Ventures and Fuel Capital, with additional funding from Ulu Ventures, Gaingels and 360 Venture Collective. Previously, HUSSLUP raised a pre-seed investment in 2021 from the Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs accelerator powered by Techstars. To date, HUSSLUP has around 6,000 members, according to the company."
562,Tesla more than tripled its Austin gigafactory workforce in 2022,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 5, 2023","Tesla’s 2,500-acre manufacturing hub in Austin, Texas tripled its workforce last year, according to the company’s annual compliance report filed with county officials. Bloomberg first reported on the news. The report filed with Travis County’s Economic Development Program shows that Tesla increased its Austin workforce from just 3,523 contingent and permanent employees in 2021 to 12,277 by the end of 2022. Bloomberg reports that just over half of Tesla’s workers reside in the county, with the average full-time employee earning a salary of at least $47,147. Outside of Tesla’s factory, the average salary of an Austin worker is $68,060, according to data from ZipRecruiter. TechCrunch was unable to acquire a copy of the report, so it’s not clear if those workers are all full-time. If they are, Tesla has hired a far cry more full-time employees than it is contracted to do. According to the agreement between Tesla and Travis County, the company is obligated to create 5,001 new full-time jobs over the next four years. The contract also states that Tesla must invest about $1.1 billion in the county over the next five years. Tesla’s compliance report shows that the automaker last year invested $5.81 billion in Gigafactory Texas, which officially launched a year ago at a “Cyber Rodeo” event. In January, Tesla notified regulators that it plans to invest another $770 million into an expansion of the factory to include a battery cell testing site and cathode and drive unit manufacturing site. With that investment will come more jobs. Tesla’s choice to move its headquarters to Texas and build a gigafactory there has helped the state lead the nation in job growth. The automaker builds its Model Y crossover there and plans to build its Cybertruck in Texas, as well. Giga Texas will also be a model for sustainable manufacturing, CEO Elon Musk has said. Last year, Tesla completed the first phase of what will become “the largest rooftop solar installation in the world,” according to the report, per Bloomberg. Tesla has begun on the second phase of installation, but already there are reports of being able to see the rooftop from space. The goal is to generate 27 megawatts of power. Musk has also promised to turn the site into an “ecological paradise,” complete with a boardwalk and a hiking/biking trail that will open to the public. There haven’t been many updates on that front, and locals have been concerned that the site is actually more of an environmental nightmare that has led to noise and water pollution. The site, located at the intersection of State Highway 130 and Harold Green Road, east of Austin, is along the Colorado River and could create a climate catastrophe if the river overflows. The site of Tesla’s gigafactory has also historically been the home of low-income households and has a large population of Spanish-speaking residents. It’s not clear if the jobs at the factory reflect the demographic population of the community in which it resides."
563,"Meta can be sued in Kenya over alleged unlawful layoffs and blacklisting of moderators, court rules",['@annienjanja'],"April 21, 2023","A Kenyan court has ruled that Meta can be sued in the East African country over alleged unlawful sacking and blacklisting of content moderators, and dismissed the social media giant’s application that sought to have the case thrown out. Meta Platforms Inc. and Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. wanted the case nullified on claims that they are foreign companies, and that Kenyan courts lack the jurisdiction to hear and determine petitions against them. Meta and its content review partners in sub-Saharan Africa, Sama and Majorel, have been sued in Kenya by 183 content moderators. The moderators claim they were fired by Sama unlawfully after it wound down its content review arm, and that Meta instructed its new Luxembourg-based partner, Majorel, to blacklist ex-Sama content moderators. The court said it has the “jurisdiction to determine the matter of alleged unlawful and unfair termination of employment on grounds of redundancy” by Meta and Sama. It also said it has the authority “to enforce alleged violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms” by Meta, Sama and Majorel. “The present dispute arises from an employer – employee dispute. The court will consider the nature and extent of liability with regard to the alleged breaches and violations of the Constitution arising and or related to employment and Labour relations in Kenya,” added the labor relations court. “It is in the court’s considered finding that it is immaterial whether the alleged violations occur in a physical or virtual space within the jurisdiction of this Court in Kenya.” The ruling now paves the way for a full hearing. The court also upheld interim orders issued mid-March temporarily barring Meta from engaging its new content moderation subcontractor, Majorel, and Sama from conducting any form of redundancy pending the determination of the case. Sama has since sent moderators on permanent leave, leaving Meta’s content review in sub-Saharan Africa in limbo. The moderators claim that Sama failed to issue redundancy notices, as required by the Kenyan law, and that their terminal dues were pegged on their signing of non-disclosure documents. Sama argues that it observed the law, and communicated the decision to discontinue content moderation in a town hall meeting, and through email and notification letters. Sama laid off its employees at the end of last month after it wound down its content moderation arm to concentrate on labeling work (computer vision data annotation), laying off 260 moderators at its hub in Kenya, which hosted moderators from various countries within Africa. Meta and Sama are also facing another case over claims of exploitation and union busting. Some Ethiopians have also sued the social media giant over claims that it amplified hateful content, and failed to have enough personnel, with an understanding of local languages, to moderate content.

564,"Apple and Google team up on industry spec to make Bluetooth tracking devices, like AirTag, safer",['@sarahintampa'],"May 2, 2023","After numerous cases of Bluetooth trackers like Apple’s AirTag being used for stalking or other criminal apps, Apple and Google today released a joint announcement saying they will work together to lead an industry-wide initiative to draft a specification that would alert users in the case of unwanted tracking from Bluetooth devices. The companies said they’re seeking input from other industry participants and advocacy groups in the matter, and noted that other tracker makers like Samsung, Tile, Chipolo, eufy Security and Pebblebee have also expressed interest in the draft. The companies submitted a proposed specification as an Internet-Draft via a standards development organization, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Other interested parties are now being invited to review and comment over the next three months. After this time, Apple and Google will offer feedback and will release a production implementation of the specification by year’s end that will be supported in future versions of iOS and Android, they said. While Apple’s AirTag wasn’t the first Bluetooth tracker on the market to present security concerns around misuse — Tile and others had existed for years — Apple’s ability to integrate AirTag with the 2 billion+ Apple devices globally, including its over 1 billion iPhones, as part of its “Find My” network, made it one of the largest players almost immediately. It also popularized the then-still niche technology of using Bluetooth trackers to find lost items, making the devices for doing so a household name. Soon, stories began to emerge that AirTags were being used for stalking and other concerns, like car theft. Apple in February 2022 announced it would work to address some of the problems it had created with new features, including new privacy warnings, alerts and expanded documentation. Hoping to deter misuse, it also said it was actively working with law enforcement on all AirTag-related requests it receives, and confirmed it was able to provide the account details in response to a subpoena or other valid law enforcement request.   Today, the company along with Google, wants to make these safety measures more of a standard, rather than just a feature set. This includes building on the AirTag protections Apple had already released but also, critically, ensuring that users would be able to combat unwanted tracking by offering tools across both iOS and Android platforms. Today, for instance, Apple offers a Tracker Detect app for Android users, but it doesn’t work as well as Apple’s own Find My app because it requires users to actively scan for tags, rather than receive proactive warnings and alerts. The new spec, meanwhile, wants to make unwanted tracking alerts work across any platform. Various advocacy groups praised the effort in today’s announcement, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Center for Democracy & Technology. The former had been advocating for a universal standard to protect survivors from the misuse of trackers and noted, in a statement, it was ‘encouraged by this progress.” The latter referred to the move as a “welcome step” to prevent the misuse of these devices. Google and Apple have worked together before on products that benefit their respective customer bases, including with the development of the COVID-19 tracing tool for iOS And Android users in 2020. Just ahead of today’s announcement, AirTag had a boost of good press with news that the New York Police Department was encouraging car owners to use AirTag to prevent car theft, which increased following TikTok viral videos demonstrating hot wiring Kia and Hyundai vehicles. The city said it was also distributing 500 free AirTags to car owners, donated by the nonprofit Association for a Better New York. “Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items,” said Ron Huang, Apple’s vice president of Sensing and Connectivity, in a statement. “We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended. This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections, and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android.” “Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industrywide action to solve,” added Dave Burke, Google’s vice president of Engineering for Android. “Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users, and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices.”"
565,Construction insurance company Billy raises additional $2.5 million,['@dominicmadori'],"April 5, 2023","Construction insurance company Billy announced today the closing of an additional $2.5 million led by Entrada Ventures and MetaProp, bringing its total funding to $6.7 million. Nyasha Gutsa and Grant Robbins started the company in 2020 as a pandemic project. Gutsa combined his background in construction product management with Robbins’ decade of experience running a construction business to launch Billy, which digitizes and streamlines the construction compliance management process. The company has two revenue models: First is a SaaS platform that collects, verifies and tracks compliance documents like business licenses and W9 forms for general contractors, developers and property managers. The second model uses the data from the SaaS platform to operate a marketplace that provides insurance solutions. So far, Billy says it has been used to build high-speed rail projects, as well as residential buildings and homes. Gutsa and Robbins were inspired to launch the company after noticing that risk in the construction sector was steadily increasing. “In construction tech, nobody has built workflows for the insurance industry,” Gutsa told TechCrunch. “That means carriers don’t have visibility to their client’s risk, and that’s important because typically, on a construction site, there’s like two people getting hurt or killed every hour. That’s a lawsuit waiting to happen. Billy provides them with that visibility.” Robbins added to that, saying Billy hopes to reduce friction and confusion that comes with managing the insurance requirements for a project. “We’re seeing demand surge from general contractors who enjoy automating their entire compliance management systems,” he said. As CEO, Gutsa started fundraising for Billy in May 2022 and said he experienced the routine highs and lows that come with pitching. Last year, Black founders raised just 1% of all venture capital funding, a slight dip from the record 1.3% allocated to them in 2021. Gutsa himself was not immune to snide remarks from investors. “The process was a little tough,” he recalled. Billy met its lead, Entrada Ventures, through another investor in Gutsa and Robbins’ network. Eric Kanowsky, a managing partner at Entrada Ventures, told TechCrunch that the firm invested in Billy because it was attracted to the deep knowledge its team had regarding construction technology. “With this capital infusion, Billy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity and is now capable of moving quickly to scale,” he said. Zachary Aarons, the co-founder of the firm MetaProp, which co-led the round, saw Billy’s value. “When I was working as a project manager on small ground-up construction projects, I spent most of my time dealing with insurance issues,” he told TechCrunch. “Now, thankfully, there is an app for that.” Others in the round include Central Coast Ventures, Gaingels and angel investors Doug Hirsch and Levelset founder Scott Wolfe. Billy plans to use the money to accelerate sales and increase customer retention. It is a licensed digital broker representing more than 30 insurance carriers to help them manage workflow. It just closed a deal to start providing its services to the construction software company Procore. This journey has been one full circle for Gutsa. Born in Zimbabwe, he was a childhood pen pal of the late Michael Tyler Fisher, a member of the billionaire Fisher Family real estate dynasty. The family would fly Gutsa to New York each summer to spend time with Michael until the boy’s untimely death at age 12. After his death, Gutsa kept in touch with the family, and after graduating from high school two years ahead of schedule, the Fisher family offered him a private scholarship in Michael’s honor to work for their construction company. He worked his way up and learned the ins and outs of construction. Then he moved to Procore, where he worked as a senior product manager and was one of few Black employees. There, he helped digitize the process of managing construction finances. Now, the Fisher family uses Billy to power insurance and compliance for one of their Las Vegas properties; it’s also one of the first Black-owned companies to be integrated into Procore. “This moment represents the culmination of a journey that started in Harare, Zimbabwe,” Gutsa said. “I hope my stories inspired others to embrace vulnerability and pursue their dreams.”"
566,Pitch Deck Teardown: Careerist’s $8M Series A deck,['@Haje'],"April 27, 2023","Careerist claims it closed an $8 million round of funding with a tight 12-slide deck and gave us a lot to learn from in the process. Not all in good ways, but I’m getting slightly ahead of myself.   We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.  The team submitted this slide deck with the note that it was submitted exactly as it pitched it to the investors. What can you do to gain a foothold in the market? What are your marketing and customer acquisition channels? This question is only partially answered by Careerist, and that worries me a little. This deck sets off a number of alarm bells for me — I’ll get to why in just a moment — and I imagine the founding team fought an uphill battle pitching this to investors. Having said that, the company did go through Y Combinator and claims it was successful in raising an $8 million round from Cathexis, Xploration, Cold Start Ventures, Grant Park Ventures and others. Let’s dig in and look to see if we can find some clues as to why the company caught the eye of these investors. [Slide 5] Traction is king. Image Credits: Careerist
Traction truly resolves any issues a company may possibly have. Building a company that is growing from half a million dollars to $12 million of revenue in four years is pretty impressive, especially given that up to this point, according to its own press release, the company had raised just $1.2 million of capital. Turning $1.2 million of investment into $12 million of revenue, it turns out, is enough to catch the attention of investors. [Slide 5] Traction is king. Image Credits: Careerist In order to drive that much revenue, you’ve got to find your customers somewhere, and it seems like Careerist cracked that nut: [Slide 8] That’s some serious growth hacking there. Image Credits: Careerist
On its slides, the company claims that it gets 35% of its traffic organically and another 25% from referrals. Those are two extremely powerful, low-cost acquisition channels that can drive extraordinary, high-value customers. But that’s a double-edged sword. Referrals generally do scale well alongside other channels: If you get a 0.2 referral on average per customer, and you acquire 10 customers, you get two “free” customers due to referrals. The challenge is with the organic traffic, which is much harder to scale on demand. In other words, once you close an $8 million round of funding, how are you going to accelerate your sales dramatically? [Slide 8] That’s some serious growth hacking there. Image Credits: Careerist It doesn’t specify whether the other channels (Google, webinars and Facebook) are paid acquisition channels. If they are, I’d expect to see the cost of acquisition (CAC) here, and an analysis on whether these customers also end up referring additional customers. But overall, there’s a lot to love on this slide: Finding 1,600 customers who are paying you $12,000+ each (see slide 7 in the slide deck, below) is objectively impressive. The cool thing is, you can sense-check those numbers: The company claims that it has 1,600 customers and has done cumulative $19 million of revenue. That works out to around $12,000 per customer, proving that the numbers are internally consistent. [Slide 10] E-learning is huge, finding jobs is popular and hiring the right staff is crucial. That all adds up. Image Credits: Careerist
Careerist finds itself in a curious space here, with a huge opportunity. In fact, if the company wasn’t seeing extraordinary traction and lifetime value (LTV), these numbers would be hard to believe. But with the traction in place, these numbers seem more or less plausible. Besides, in truly enormous markets (hiring, training, etc.) market sizing is essentially just a checkbox. [Slide 10] E-learning is huge, finding jobs is popular and hiring the right staff is crucial. That all adds up. Image Credits: Careerist One example of that would be toothpaste: There’s no doubt that there’s a huge market for it, and no investor will argue with you about that. The questions then become “What can you do to gain a foothold in those markets?” and “What are your marketing and customer acquisition channels?” Careerist only partially answers those questions, and that worries me a little. The above are some of the positives in the Careerist pitch deck, but unfortunately, there are also a few Texas-sized red flags that make me wonder how the company was successful in raising money at all. I suspect the answer, as I alluded to above, is because of its traction. In the rest of this teardown, I’ll take a look at three things Careerist could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck. "
567,Meta Verified is under fire in sex work circles for revealing users’ legal names,['@morgan_sung'],"April 10, 2023","With Meta Verified, users can pay for an enviable blue check next to their name. But the feature also requires users to use their legal name as their profile display name without the option to change it, raising concerns among sex workers, trans creators and other privacy advocates.  “For $15, it’s doxxing you,” Pomma, a sex worker educator and adult content creator also known as Blair Bishop said. “Obviously with the current politics going on within the country, with the war on porn and the war on trans people, this is just so unsafe.”  Meta Verified, which launched last month to all U.S. users, includes other perks in addition to the verification badge. For $14.99 a month on mobile (or $11.99 on the web for Facebook-only access), subscribers are granted direct account support from Meta, proactive impersonation protection and exclusive stickers for Facebook and Instagram. To confirm their identity for verification, users have to provide a selfie video and their government-issued photo ID. But Meta Verified also requires subscribers’ display names to match the name on their ID, causing confusion among users. When applying for verification, users are prompted to enter their first and last name as it appears on their ID. They also have the option to use middle names, initials and “common abbreviations” like “Ben” instead of Benjamin, according to a Meta spokesperson. The application states that verified users can only change their name or profile photo if they cancel their subscription, make changes and subscribe again. Users can review their verification application before submitting it, where they’re told that any changes to their profile will be publicly visible. The page shows a preview of their Instagram handle, profile picture and name, but it doesn’t explicitly state that the name the user submitted will be their profile display name.  Meta says that anyone signing up for the premium service will receive a response within 48 hours — using the middle name on my ID, I was verified in about 20 minutes.  Meta Verified requires subscribers to match their public display name to the name on their government-issued ID. Image Credits: Meta Meta Verified requires subscribers to match their public display name to the name on their government-issued ID. Image Credits: Meta As Meta rolled out the new features, creators took to Twitter to warn each other of the legal name requirements.  OnlyFans creator Abigail Mac said she tried to apply for verification under her stage name, but was denied. She then tried to apply for verification using just the initials of her legal name, but was denied again. She was immediately approved for verification when she applied using her full legal name, but was unable to change her display name back to her stage name once she was verified.  “Putting your name out there, fans can now go on the internet and search, ‘Where did this person grow up? Where do they live now?’ Can we look up house records?’” Abigail Mac said. “And this is how people find celebrities. A lot of things are public record when it comes to buying a home with your real name.”  In an email, a Meta Support representative told Abigail Mac that a user’s Instagram profile “must match the name on their Government ID” to deter impersonation. The backlash against Meta Verified’s ID requirements echoes that of Facebook’s infamous real name policy, which the platform implemented in 2014. An individual user reported hundreds of accounts belonging to drag performers, trans users and others in the LGBTQ community as fake. To keep their accounts, flagged users had to verify that they were using their real names by submitting their ID — which didn’t necessarily reflect the users’ chosen name.  Facebook publicly apologized, and although it didn’t lift its real name policy, the company now allows flagged users to explain their situation before they’re suspended. Facebook eventually allowed flagged users whose names don’t match their government-issued ID to use non-government documents like library cards and diplomas to prove their identity. Sex workers have questioned why Meta Verified’s identity verification options are so limited.  Abigail Mac’s Instagram account is already monetized via paid subscriptions and Instagram shop purchases, and she receives regular payouts from Meta. She said she already had to submit her government-issued photo ID and other tax documents to monetize her account, and questioned why her legal name had to be public for her to be verified. London River, another adult performer, decried Meta’s display name requirement as “preposterous.”  “In other words, yes, you must dox yourself to be verified,” London River said in response to a screenshot of the Meta Support email that Abigail Mac tweeted. “We all have plenty of documentation to link our real names with our performer names, business documents, trademarks, test results, etc… but no. None of that matters.”  Verification is a “double-edged sword,” Abigail Mac said. Although revealing her legal name is risky, being verified has allowed her to take down impersonators and catfish accounts. Before she was verified, Abigail Mac said she spent years trying to report copycat accounts, and that she has spoken to fans who were scammed by accounts impersonating her own.    Her engagement on Instagram has skyrocketed since she was verified — within a week of verification, her account overview showed a 131% increase in accounts reached, and a nearly 60% increase in engagement. Before she was verified, her Instagram Lives would average around 100 viewers. Her most recent Instagram Live had 600, and within 10 minutes, she made $11 “just sitting there and talking.” The Meta Verified subscription in New Zealand and Australia includes increased account visibility and reach, but that feature hasn’t been rolled out in the U.S. yet. The Meta spokesperson said that Abigail Mac’s spike in engagement isn’t necessarily a direct correlation to her Meta Verified subscription.  For now, Abigail Mac plans to keep her Meta Verified subscription, even though she puts herself at risk by revealing her legal name. She said she’s “already been doxxed before,” and wants to see if her increased engagement can be monetized.  “My account is growing, and that’s just a silly little number,” Abigail Mac said. “But is that actually translating to subscribers? So I’ll probably know that in a month to three months, I’ll really know if it makes a difference.”   But for others, like Pomma, the internet is unsafe as it is.  “For us, for trans people, for sex workers, this just creates such a hostile environment for the most marginalized just trying to exist online,” they said. “You get direct chat support with a real person, it’s easier to take down catfish accounts. So I just wonder how this will be used against people who don’t verify or can’t verify.”   The concerns over Meta’s verification requirements dovetails with broader debate among sex work circles over age verification requirements for adult sites. This year, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia and Utah passed laws requiring users to submit a government-issued ID in order to view porn sites. Eleven more states have proposed similar laws.  Ashley, a sex worker peer organizer who works on tech platform issues, pointed out Meta’s verification requirements should raise red flags for all users, not just adult content creators.  “If you do want to give people the option of proving it with ID, then it has to be very safely done. Ideally, the data is not stored anywhere. When you get ID’d at a bar or at a sex party, they don’t store a record of it along with the biometric face scan,” she said. “It’s not surveillance.” Sex workers have been leading the charge against online censorship and mass surveillance since SESTA/FOSTA was signed into law, which drastically censored online sex work in an attempt to stop sex trafficking. Many, like Pomma, are wary of online ID checks in wake of increasingly hostile legislation that further criminalizes sex work.  “Forcing people to submit IDs online, with the way our legislators and our environments are right now, just seems a little like a slippery slope to me,” Pomma said.  A Meta spokesperson said that the company is launching with a high security standard. The company may eventually ease the requirements, the spokesperson said, and may work on a “secure solution” for identity verification that doesn’t require users to match their profile names to their government ID. Meta did not specify a timeline for relaxing the ID requirements, and could not guarantee that Meta Verified subscribers would be allowed to change their display names.  Though some creators may feel like Meta Verified isn’t for them, the spokesperson said the company is “continuing to invest” in its creator community through both its free and paid tools.  Meta could at least allow verified users to keep their legal names private, Ashley said.  “The verification process should not impact the display name,” she continued. “It’s a very simple change that would make things safer for everyone, not just sex workers and trans people, because many people use a pen name online in order to have some separation between their public and private life.”"

569,"Accenture to cut 19,000 jobs",['@refsrc'],"March 23, 2023","Tech consultancy giant Accenture plans to cut 19,000 jobs, or 2.5% of its workforce, and has lowered its annual revenue and profit forecasts, becoming the latest behemoth to trim expenses in the wake of dwindling global economic conditions. The reduction in jobs, over half of which affects individuals in non-billable corporate functions, will be undertaken in the next 18 months, Accenture said in an SEC filing (PDF) Thursday. The company had increased its workforce by 38,000 in the financial year ended February 2023 to serve the increased demand in its services and solutions, it said. “For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 12%, down from 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand,” Accenture wrote. The company said it now expects annual revenue growth for the fiscal 2023 to be between 8% to 10%, down from 8% to 11%. “Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. In some cases, these conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending,” the Dublin-headquartered firm added."
570,US lidar maker Luminar wants to light up China’s smart vehicles,['@ritacyliao'],"April 17, 2023","Luminar, the Nasdaq-listed lidar maker from Florida, is making a push into China as the world’s largest auto market races to put automated and autonomous driving vehicles on the road. By 2028, more than 1 million Luminar-equipped cars will be on the road in China, Luminar’s founder and CEO Austin Russell said this week at Auto Shanghai, one of the world’s largest auto trade fairs. All of the cars will have advanced safety capabilities from the start and come equipped with the capabilities to unlock higher levels of autonomy over time, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. It’s refreshing to see foreign investment continue to flow into the auto sector between the two superpowers despite their escalating standoffs over issues like national security. After all, it’s hard to overlook China’s enormous car market. With its 500 million drivers, China is a coveted place for foreign automakers and suppliers. Much of Tesla’s meteoric rise has been credited to its success in China, which now accounts for more than half of its deliveries and has become a major manufacturing hub for the EV behemoth. People in China are also willing to pay for smarter cars. Sixty percent of the Chinese consumers surveyed by McKinsey & Company in 2021 said they were likely to buy a Level 4 advanced highway pilot for less than $10,000, compared to 57% in the U.S. and only 36% in Germany. It’s no surprise, then, to see Chinese carmakers, from state-owned giants to startups, rushing to integrate automated driving features, which still require hands on the wheels, into their vehicles as a selling point. Luminar is catching the wave of welcoming consumers in China. To do so, it’s teamed up with Taiwan’s TPK, a key touch-screen supplier to Apple and Tesla, to “build and operate an additional high-volume factory driven by rapidly growing demand for Luminar in Asia,” the company announced at Auto Shanghai. This adds to its existing manufacturing bases across the U.S., Thailand, Mexico and China. At the initial stage, the new TPK facility, which will be in Xiamen of China’s southeast Fujian Province, is expected to produce up to 600,000 lidar sensors annually to serve clients such as Mercedes-Benz, which just signed a “multibillion-dollar” deal to use Luminar lidars in its next-gen vehicles. It remains to be seen if this new Asian manufacturing hub will also be fulfilling orders from Luminar’s clients beyond the continent. But China will definitely play a big part in its sales. Of the now more than 20 production vehicle models Luminar is designed into, the majority are slated for the Chinese market, the company said. There’s another important client. At Auto Shanghai, Volvo unveiled that its all-electric SUV EX90 Excellence, which will come with Luminar’s lidars, will first hit the streets in China. The tie-up with TPK goes beyond their manufacturing partnership. TPK is also planning to buy Luminar stock to reflect its “belief in Luminar’s potential,” according to Luminar’s announcement. The lidar maker’s stock has lost over 80% of its value since peaking at $37 in February 2021. Luminar faces a host of domestic competitors in China, ranging from Hesai, which just went public in the U.S.; RoboSense, which has secured a long-term partnership with Chinese robotaxi upstart DeepRoute; and Livox, the low-key lidar maker that came out of the drone giant DJI. The story was updated on Apr 18, 2023 with additional comments from Luminar.          "
571,Prohibition of AI that ‘subverts state power’ in China may chill its nascent industry,['@techcrunch'],"April 11, 2023","Chinese regulators have proposed restrictive rules around AI models like ChatGPT being built in the country, requiring user identification and security reviews, and prohibiting “any content that subverts state power, advocates the overthrow of the socialist system, incites splitting the country or undermines national unity.” The rules come hot on the heels of Chinese tech companies rolling out their versions of general purpose large language models, versatile AI systems that can converse in natural language and carry out a surprising number of tasks. While the reception of SenseTime, Baidu, and Alibaba’s models over the last month suggests they’re somewhat behind the likes of GPT-4, it’s clear the industry there is equally dedicated to developing these capabilities. Unfortunately, shortly after the debut of Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen model, one of the country’s tech regulators, the Cyberspace Administration of China, proposed restrictions that may smother relevant innovations — and the Chinese AI industry’s ambitions along with them. The draft rules are not available in English (I took the above quote from the Financial Times translation syndicated at Ars Technica) but can be viewed at the regulator’s website here. The first part of article 4 prohibits generative AI that subverts government power and authority or questions national unity, along with various other categories of prohibitions like ethnic discrimination, terrorism, and so on. This kind of catch-all morality clause is commonplace in China, but it happens to be the kind of restriction that generative AI is uniquely incapable of complying with. Even the most carefully trained and tuned LLM seems to be capable of being tricked into saying all manner of objectionable things. Whether Chinese censors decide this is in compliance with the law or not is more or less entirely up to them, something that makes the prospect of dedicating serious resources to such a project somewhat fraught. Of course, much of Chinese industry exists under a similarly suspended dagger, and although China’s regulators are capricious, they are not foolish enough to throw away the fruits of the government’s years of propping up R&D in the country. It’s probable that, not unlike other content-limiting laws there, this will act more as a fig leaf and ironclad excuse for the government to exert influence — not a blanket prohibition.   If anything, it is the other requirements that may slow AI development there to a crawl. The CAC draft rules require, among other things, that providers assume liability and responsibility for the training data of models, including difficult to measure metrics like authenticity, objectivity, and diversity; users of the services must be verified as real people; personal information and reputation must be respected or regulators may find the provider liable; generated content must be labeled as such; and many other restrictions. Certainly some of these requirements could be considered prudent or even critical to a responsible AI industry, but the truth is many of them would be incredibly difficult, perhaps impossible to implement by today’s companies and R&D efforts. OpenAI has achieved its success partly because it is working in an almost complete regulatory vacuum. If the law required that the company, say, obtain permission from the rights holders of the text and media it used to train its models, it would probably still be waiting to build GPT-2. If an AI startup or even an established company can’t confidently operate in China for fear of violating these rules at a massive scale, they may decide that their resources are better spent elsewhere. As fast-moving as this industry is, such a setback may be very difficult to regain. The Financial Times quoted Alibaba’s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, as saying that “10 to 20 years from now, when we look back, we will realize we were all on the same starting line.” That is almost certainly true, and from a similar perspective we may well see how regulation throttled innovation — or perhaps how it prevented a stagnating monopoly, or protected people from the well-organized mass theft of their data. The draft rules are open for comment (by parties in China, obviously) for the next month, after which they may or may not be revised, and are slated to enter effect later this year.  "
572,Bosch to acquire TSI Semiconductors to boost US chip production,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 26, 2023","Bosch will acquire the assets of U.S. chipmaker TSI Semiconductors to expand its semiconductor business with silicon carbide chips (SiC), the German engineering and technology giant said Wednesday. Bosch also said that following the acquisition, it will invest $1.5 billion over the next few years to upgrade TSI Semiconductors’ manufacturing facilities in Roseville, California. Starting in 2026, the first chips will be produced on 200-millimeter wafers based on silicon carbide. News of more chips being produced on U.S. soil is welcome in the automotive world, one of the industries most affected by the global semiconductor shortage that began with the COVID-19 pandemic. The shortage started when factories shut or slowed production due to lockdowns, thus disrupting global supply chains. A surge in demand for electronics as people stayed inside, as well as a boom in demand from an automotive industry determined to go electric and build smarter vehicles, only exacerbated the problem. Electric vehicles on average use more chips than their gas-powered counterparts, and most new EVs hitting the market today promise advanced driver assistance systems and high-tech infotainment systems. As a result, in 2021, the average car had about 1,200 chips, twice the number in 2010, and a figure that will likely increase.   SiCs, which Bosch’s new factory will produce, have been a hot commodity among automakers, as well. The company says the market for SiCs has grown by 30% a year on average, and that’s in part because they offer greater range and more efficient recharging for EVs. They also lose up to 50% less energy, last longer and require less maintenance. Bosch expects an average of 25 of its chips will be integrated in every new vehicle by 2025. “This $1.5 billion investment will bring down costs, strengthen our electric vehicle supply chain, help rebuild American manufacturing, and create economic opportunity for the working families of California,” said Vice President Kamala Harris in a statement. “And it will put more electric vehicles on the road, a priority I have worked for since I served in the United States Senate. All of this was made possible by our Administration’s Invest in America agenda.” Bosch said the full scope of the planned investment will depend heavily on federal funding opportunities available via the CHIPS and Science Act, which the Biden administration signed into law in August 2022, as well as economic development opportunities within California. The CHIPS and Science Act aims to boost American semiconductor research, development and production, as the U.S. races to compete with China. Last year, the U.S. prohibited the sale of advanced chips with high performance and fast interconnect speeds to China. Bosch wouldn’t say how much money it hopes to get in federal funds to advance its U.S.-based chip-making goals. In February, the Biden administration launched the first CHIPS for America funding opportunity, a $50 billion injection to revitalize the semiconductor industry, including $39 billion in semiconductor incentives. The administration said the first funding opportunity seeks “applications for projects to construct, expand or modernize commercial facilities for the production of…semiconductors.” Bosch and TSI Semiconductors are not sharing the terms of the acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval. Bosch says the buy will reinforce its international semiconductor manufacturing network. The company has been producing semiconductors for over 60 years and has invested billions of euros into the business globally, specifically at its wafer fabs in Reutlingen and Dresden, Germany. Correction: The headline has been changed because it inaccurately described the acquisition as a $1.5 billion deal.  Bosch did not disclose the acquisition price. The $1.5 billion is the additional investment the company is making into the facility.  "
573,Google brings generative AI to cybersecurity,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 24, 2023","There’s a new trend emerging in the generative AI space — generative AI for cybersecurity — and Google is among those looking to get in on the ground floor. At the RSA Conference 2023 today, Google announced Cloud Security AI Workbench, a cybersecurity suite powered by a specialized “security” AI language model called Sec-PaLM. An offshoot of Google’s PaLM model, Sec-PaLM is “fine-tuned for security use cases,” Google says — incorporating security intelligence such as research on software vulnerabilities, malware, threat indicators and behavioral threat actor profiles. Cloud Security AI Workbench spans a range of new AI-powered tools, like Mandiant’s Threat Intelligence AI, which will leverage Sec-PaLM to find, summarize and act on security threats. (Recall that Google purchased Mandiant in 2022 for $5.4 billion.) VirusTotal, another Google property, will use Sec-PaLM to help subscribers analyze and explain the behavior of malicious scripts. Elsewhere, Sec-PaLM will assist customers of Chronicle, Google’s cloud cybersecurity service, in searching security events and interacting “conservationally” with the results. Users of Google’s Security Command Center AI, meanwhile, will get “human-readable” explanations of attack exposure courtesy of Sec-PaLM, including impacted assets, recommended mitigations and risk summaries for security, compliance and privacy findings. “While generative AI has recently captured the imagination, Sec-PaLM is based on years of foundational AI research by Google and DeepMind, and the deep expertise of our security teams,” Google wrote in a blog post this morning. “We have only just begun to realize the power of applying generative AI to security, and we look forward to continuing to leverage this expertise for our customers and drive advancements across the security community.” Those are pretty bold ambitions, particularly considering that VirusTotal Code Insight, the first tool in the Cloud Security AI Workbench, is only available in a limited preview at the moment. (Google says that it plans to roll out the rest of the offerings to “trusted testers” in the coming months.) It’s frankly not clear how well Sec-PaLM works — or doesn’t work — in practice. Sure, “recommended mitigations and risk summaries” sound useful, but are the suggestions that much better or more precise because an AI model produced them? After all, AI language models — no matter how cutting-edge — make mistakes. And they’re susceptible to attacks like prompt injection, which can cause them to behave in ways their creators didn’t intend. That’s not stopping the tech giants, of course. In March, Microsoft launched Security Copilot, a new tool that aims to “summarize” and “make sense” of threat intelligence using generative AI models from OpenAI including GPT-4. In the press materials, Microsoft — similar to Google — claimed that generative AI would better equip security professionals to combat new threats. The jury’s very much out on that. In truth, generative AI for cybersecurity might turn out to be more hype than anything — there’s a dearth of studies on its effectiveness. We’ll see the results soon enough with any luck, but in the meantime, take Google’s and Microsoft’s claims with a healthy grain of salt."
574,Woodoo is creating decarbonized wood-based materials,['@romaindillet'],"April 24, 2023","Woodoo, a startup working on alternative materials for various industries, has raised $31 million. The company is manufacturing composite materials based on wood so that they can replace common materials like glass, leather and steel. Around two-thirds of the amount raised is an equity funding round led by Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital with One Creation, Purple and various business angels also participating. Debts and grants represent one-third of the total amount. Woodoo founder and CEO Timothée Boitouzet originally studied to become an architect. He started his career working for several famous architectural firms. Among other things, he worked on Stamford Bridge, the Longchamp Racecourse in Paris and the Rolex Learning Center in Lausanne. As is often the case with large projects like those ones, Boitouzet’s architectural firms relied heavily on glass and steel. But he started wondering about low-carbon, high-performance materials that could replace those twentieth-century building materials. Could wood be the perfect candidate? While it’s abundant, affordable and it naturally absorbs carbon emissions, “it burns, it rots and you can’t build very high buildings because it’s not very rigid,” Boitouzet said. Essentially, Woodoo wants to address those drawbacks so that wood-based materials become a viable alternative to more traditional materials. “There are three components in wood. All the problems of wood are due to lignin, which is the glue between the wood fibers. It is removed and replaced by a binding agent that creates much stronger molecular bonds. This also makes the wood completely inert to its environment,” Boitouzet said. Wood is submerged in several liquids to detach and extract lignin. The result is then fused with filling compound so that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” Boitouzet said. After five years of research and development, the company has filed for 50 patents and created three different materials. Woodoo Slim is a translucent and touch-sensitive wood panel that can be used in cars for dashboards and tactile buttons. It is much lighter than glass. An example of Woodoo’s material used in a car interior. Image Credits: Woodoo An example of Woodoo’s material used in a car interior. Image Credits: Woodoo The second material is an alternative to leather. It is a flexible material that still features some of the distinctive design elements of wood. It has a lot of potential in the fashion and luxury industry as it’s an animal-free leather with a much lower carbon footprint. In particular, it doesn’t require as much water to produce. Woodoo’s alternative to leather. Image Credits: Woodoo Woodoo’s alternative to leather. Image Credits: Woodoo The third material is a lightweight yet strong structural material that could be used by the construction sector. Ideally, construction companies could use this material instead of steel. Woodoo already has two industrial sites to produce those materials with a specific focus on three verticals — the luxury, automotive and construction industries. When it comes to its supply chain, Woodoo relies on wood from common trees, like poplars. While the company is headquartered in Paris, Woodoo created its first industrial site near Troyes because the Troyes area is one of the largest European areas for poplars. “Either they are not exploited, or they are exploited for wood energy or materials with very low added value,” Boitouzet said. “But these are species that grow very fast, so they store the most CO2.” With today’s funding round, the company wants to double down on its existing products and industries. “What made this important funding round possible is that we have been able to self-finance without external cash so far. I injected quite a bit of personal money, we won 44 innovation awards and of course we sell products to customers,” Boitouzet said. Woodoo has already signed deals with luxury brands (LVMH), car markers (Volkswagen and Mercedes) and more recently the first deal in the construction industry (Garnica). And with some fresh cash in its bank account, Woodoo can now scale its production and deliver on its vision."
575,Hyve gets a buzz going for its new social savings app,['@christinemhall'],"April 5, 2023","Hyve’s money app is targeting Gen Z and young millennials with a way to pay down debt, save and invest with the help of friends and family. The social finance app is now open to the public after a year testing the product with hundreds of beta users. Hyve is building a multiplayer fintech infrastructure for saving and investing where users can create their network of supporters, and those people can automatically round up their purchases to match the user’s personal cash contributions. The more people added to the “hyve,” the more money the user saves to reach their goals. Royi Markowitz, co-founder and CEO, Hyve. Image Credits: Hyve Royi Markowitz, co-founder and CEO, Hyve. Image Credits: Hyve Social finance is by no means a new concept, think Public.com, Frich Money, Braid, Follow and Shares. However, Royi Markowitz, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that Hyve is a hybrid between Venmo and Acorns and differentiates itself from competitors through its infrastructure. “At our core is our ledger, which is the money movements within the platform,” Markowitz said. “To convert a single-player ledger into a hybrid 3D multiplayer ledger is very, very difficult, especially for a company that already has hundreds of line items in their ledger. Hyve is really the only place where I could use my credit card to send you $1 or $20 or $1,000 into your investment portfolio and be part of your savings so you can get there faster.” Here’s how it works: After downloading the app and creating a profile, users link their bank accounts and set up automated deposits. Then they create their first goal and share that with friends and family. Users can also discover other people’s goals via Hyve’s social feeds and support them. The free app’s features include that auto round up of purchases, one-click investing from a savings account and 2.10% APY on all savings account balances. There are also financial tools to help eliminate debt. Hyve is pre-revenue and still in the very early stages, but through its beta program users have created a “hyve” with an average of about three people and created savings goals that they want to achieve that total over $850,000. Markowitz expects to reach 100,000 active users over the next year. Future planning for revenue includes charging for the creation of “smart” goals, saving up to pay student loans, a fee to connect users to lenders, access to insights and loan refinancing opportunities. And though it is focused on consumers, Markowitz said the company recently secured its first employer — which he declined to name — that adds 300 new customers to the roughly 1,000 people currently on the waitlist. Under this model, employers will pay Hyve a SaaS fee for each employee. The company raised $2.25 million in a pre-seed round in January 2022 from an investor group that included The Flying Whale VC, MoreVC and the founders of Guardio. It is currently raising another round of funding that is expected to close later this year.  "

577,Spend management firm Clara secures $60M amid rapid transaction growth in LatAm,['@christinemhall'],"April 26, 2023","Clara, a Mexico-based spend management company, closed on $60 million in equity in a round led by GGV Capital. The company launched its product in 2021 and provides reporting software for better financial decision-making, locally issued corporate cards, bill pay and financing solutions. It also continues to prove rapid growth. In addition, the company partners with financial institutions to provide additional lending capabilities. Clara is working with 10,000 companies across Latin America, notably in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, and reports an annual run rate of 5 million credit card transactions, which is equivalent to $1 billion, Gerry Giacomán Colyer, Clara’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. TechCrunch reported on Clara in March 2021 about the launch and its $3.5 million in pre-seed funding, then again just months later when the company grabbed $30 million in equity and a $50 million revolving credit line. General Catalyst led the seed and DST Global Partners led the Series A.   Since then, Clara was able to secure one more equity round in 2021 — that’s three now if you’re counting — with $70 million in Series B funding led by Coatue. It also brought in commitments for up to $150 million in credit from Goldman Sachs in 2022 and $90 million from Accial Capital a month ago. “It’s been great momentum for Clara,” Giacomán Colyer said. “Over 10x in transactional volume is coming from revenue. With Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, we are covering two-thirds of LatAm’s GDP. So, there’s been lots of growth since the Series B.” The new $60 million investment is an extension of the Series B, he added. It includes new investors Acrew Capital, Citius, Citi Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst, Ethos, Commerce Ventures, Goanna Capital, Bayhouse Capital and Fluent Ventures, which joined existing investors monashees, Coatue, Picus Capital, DST Global Partners, Alter Global, General Catalyst and over a dozen angel investors. Clara has now raised $160 million in total equity financing. In May 2021, TechCrunch reported that the company’s valuation was $130 million. Giacomán Colyer confirmed that, but declined to provide an updated value beyond “the valuation has grown substantially.” Clara’s co-founders Diego Iván García Escobedo and Gerry Giacomán Colyer Image Credits: Clara Clara’s co-founders Diego Iván García Escobedo and Gerry Giacomán Colyer Image Credits: Clara As part of the new investment, GGV Capital managing director Hans Tung will join Clara’s board of directors. “The Clara team is amongst the strongest that we have seen in Latin America,” Tung said in a written statement. “Expense management is a huge category globally, and Clara is the first to use software to build solutions in LatAm. The team had encountered spend management challenges as operating executives themselves and understood the problem well.” The new funding will be used to grow Clara’s engineering and product teams and technology development and to round out its leadership team. The company recently made new hires across engineering, product and risk that came from tech and financial giants like Meta, Nubank and American Express. They include Raquel Hernández, vice president of engineering; Eduardo Moore, director of product for Clara Brazil; Alberto Ramos, director of operations; Nicolas Caccaviello, director of fraud and acceptance; and Tina Reich, who joins as board observer and risk advisor. Next up, Giacomán Colyer said Clara has been an early developer of payment solutions around Brazil’s instant payment method, Pix, and is close to launching its product. It is also looking at how artificial intelligence applications can benefit the gathering of data for insights into a customer’s transactional profile. “We’re only 2 years old, so we still see a ton of upside, including companies continuing to come to us every week,” he said. “Just in March we were meeting all these top line metrics, between 25% and 40%. It was a really outstanding month, and month over month, even in our most conservative scenarios, we see it continuing to grow over 2x through the end of this year.” April 26 editor’s note to correct the company’s base to Mexico.

The company announced the news via a Medium blog late last week, informing users that the app would be discontinued and users had until June 30, 2023 to download their content. Last year, Poparazzi’s founders at TTYL Inc. said the app had grown to 5+ million total installs and confirmed its raise of $15 million in Series A funding. Though Poparazzi had felt at the time like an overnight sensation, co-founder and CEO Alex Ma and his brother, co-founder Austen Ma, had spent three years developing apps and pivoting to achieve the success they generated with Poparrazi’s launch. In a 2022 interview with TechCrunch, Alex said Poparrazi was actually the 11th or 12th app that was generated by those efforts. Among those was the audio social network, TTYL, a sort of “Clubhouse for friends,” which their company is also named for. Poparrazi, however, generated a lot of hype soon after its release, climbing the charts to reach No. 1 on the App Store. The concept behind the app was a photo-sharing-focused social network that essentially took Instagram’s tagging feature and turned it into the entire experience. On Poparazzi, users could tag their friends but couldn’t post photos of their own. The idea was that this would create a more authentic type of social network, as photos wouldn’t necessarily be the polished, perfected images that fill Instagram, but rather the casual moments that make up people’s real lives. Image Credits: Poparazzi Image Credits: Poparazzi Last June, the company confirmed its $15 million Series A raise led by Benchmark’s Sarah Tavel, who beat out a16z for the deal. The startup had previously raised $2 million in seed funding, led by Floodgate, in a round that included other investors like SV Angel, Shrug Capital and various angels. At the time, Poparazzi said its funds would give its team of 15 a runway of over two years. But soon, there were signs that Poparazzi’s time could be coming to an end. In August 2022, TechCrunch spotted the team was now dabbling with a new app, Made with Friends, that offered a twist on Poparazzi’s original concept of social networking profiles crafted by a user’s friends. Made with Friends instead asked its users to post all sorts of content to their friends’ profiles, not just photos. For example, they could post text-based content like answers to questions or prompts, as well as videos. The app had been available as a pre-release at that time, but it’s since been removed from the App Store sometime after March 26 of this year, app intelligence firm Apptopia confirmed to TechCrunch. Usage for Poparrazi had also been slowing post-launch, the firm noted. It estimated there were 6.2 million lifetime installs for the app, but it now has only around 2,000-3,000 monthly active users (MAUs) after reaching a height of 4 million MAUs previously. In its blog post, Poparrazi didn’t confirm its future plans, if any, only noting the impending shutdown and thanking its community and supporters. “We’ve been incredibly blessed to work with an amazing team of passionate designers, engineers, and marketers to help bring this movement to life. And none of this would have been possible without the backing from the most supportive, world-class group of investors,” wrote Alex Ma, in the announcement. “To our community, we are so grateful for the support and belief that you have shown us throughout our journey. Your enthusiasm and passion for Poparazzi has been the driving force behind everything we’ve done. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.” TTYL Inc. has been asked for comment. Alex Ma responded, after publication, that while the company didn’t have an official statement to share, they could confirm it was winding down and would be returning capital to investors. The team, however, will stay together and work on other projects. Updated 5/1/23, 8:53 pm et with company response."
579,FTC moves to completely prohibit Meta from monetizing kids,['@techcrunch'],"May 3, 2023","The Federal Trade Commission alleges that Meta has “repeatedly violated” privacy rules and proposes to tighten the agency’s 2020 order against the company, completely barring it from monetizing data from anyone under 18 in any way, among other new restrictions. The order in question took effect in 2020 but was created in 2019 as part of then-Facebook’s $5 billion settlement after the company violated a previous order. Now the FTC says that Facebook/Meta has violated the new order, as well as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule. “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a news release. (Due to the order and said failures spanning both names of the company, both are also used throughout.) The 2020 order created an independent third-party assessor who would evaluate whether Meta was adhering to the privacy rules, things like having new products go through privacy reviews and restrictions on how facial recognition data and phone numbers are used. This assessor recently gave the FTC their report, and apparently it is not pretty, containing evidence of numerous shortcomings or violations: “the Commission notes that the breadth and significance of these deficiencies pose substantial risks to the public,” the agency wrote. Specifically, Facebook promised (in 2018 — the timeline is long and confusing) to cut off app developers’ access to users’ data if that user had not used the app in 90 days. But it did not do so, the FTC alleges, and allowed some of that data to be used well into 2020.   The company also “misrepresented that parents could control whom their children communicated with through its Messenger Kids product.” The contact controls put in place by Facebook were inadequate, allowing children to communicate with unapproved contacts via group video calls and chats. These may not sound like the most egregious failures, but regulations around tech for kids are tight for good reason, and COPPA violations are serious. When one considers that Facebook had not only been put on warning for a decade for sloppy privacy practices, but that it knew the FTC was eyeballing its every move especially with sensitive data like that of under-13 users, one is less inclined to offer grace. This apparently cavalier approach to compliance with the FTC order has prompted the agency to tighten the screws, with a number of proposed changes to the order — something it may do when “changed conditions of fact or law or public interest” warrant it. Companies may consider themselves warned that FTC orders are very much living documents. In this case the 2020 order, affecting all of Meta’s businesses (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus), would be modified to add the following: Meta strenuously denied the FTC’s approach, calling it “a political stunt” in a statement. “Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,” said Meta policy spokesperson Christopher Sgro, accusing FTC chair Lina Khan of “a new low” in letting TikTok run free while antagonizing Meta. “We have spent vast resources building and implementing an industry-leading privacy program under the terms of our FTC agreement. We will vigorously fight this action and expect to prevail.” Today sees the FTC publishing an Order to Show Cause, which details the issues noted in brief above and was not publicly available at the time of writing. Meta has 30 days to respond, after which the agency will “carefully [consider] the facts and arguments made by the parties” and decide whether the expanded order is justified (not a foregone conclusion; one Commissioner questions the tactics). I have asked when the new order could potentially take effect and will update this post if I hear back."
