0,Millions of patients’ data confirmed stolen after Fortra mass-hack,['@carlypage_'],"May 4, 2023","Millions of people across the U.S. had reams of personal and health information stolen in a mass-hack targeting dozens of companies, including healthcare providers, according to new filings with the federal government. NationBenefits, a Florida-based technology company that offers supplementary benefits to its 20 million-plus members across the U.S., confirmed in April that hackers had stolen member data as the result of a mass ransomware attack targeting customers who used Fortra’s GoAnywhere file-transfer software. At the time, NationBenefits confirmed that more than 7,100 state residents had their personal information stolen in the cyberattack, but the full number of affected individuals was not known. Now, a listing on the U.S. Department of Health’s data breach portal confirms that more than three million NationBenefits members had data stolen in the incident, making it the third largest health data-related breach of 2023 so far. When reached by TechCrunch, NationBenefits spokesperson Kal Gajraj declined to say what types of data was stolen. However, NationBenefits is currently listed on the dark web leak site of the Clop ransomware gang, which claimed responsibility for the Fortra attacks. Samples of the stolen data, seen by TechCrunch, includes customer databases that include members’ names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, gender, marital status and insurance details. NationBenefits is one of several healthcare providers whose Fortra-hosted systems were raided by hackers. The hackers also hit Brightline, a virtual coaching and therapy provider for children. Brightline has yet to confirm how many of its patients have been impacted, but the Department of Health’s breach portal suggests more than 960,000 of the company’s pediatric mental health patients had data stolen in the cyberattack. In a notice on its website, Brightline — which has repeatedly refused to answer TechCrunch’s questions — said this information includes protected health and personal information. U.S. healthcare giant Community Health Systems in February was the first to confirm that hackers had stolen data from its Fortra system. In a notice, the healthcare provider said hackers had accessed the personal data of at least one million patients.  "

2,How to use the secondary market to find clues about who will IPO first,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"March 24, 2023","Venture capitalists and startup founders alike went into 2023 eagerly hoping for the return of the industry’s exit environment — specifically, the resurgence of IPOs. After 2021, a record-breaking year for IPOs, everything screeched to a halt in 2022. PitchBook counted 296 venture-backed companies that went public in 2021, which doubles — or more — any other year prior. This plummeted to 28 in 2022, the lowest number recorded since 2009, amid the financial crisis. There were a few companies, including Instacart, Chime and Reddit, that filed for IPO in late 2021 or early 2022 that have yet to exit the private market. As many hope exit opportunities will roar back in the latter half of 2023, we’re still curious about which companies will go public first. While not a perfect predictor by any means, the secondaries market might offer hints at how close some of these companies are to going public. "
3,"As Elliott withdraws Salesforce board nominations, activist pressure could be easing",['@ron_miller'],"March 27, 2023","Could activist peace be at hand at Salesforce? With the announcement Monday that Elliott would be withdrawing its nomination for the board of directors, it seems that the CRM leader could have forged a peace agreement. The question is: At what cost? While it’s not clear what this agreement means to the other four activist firms operating inside the company, Elliott is likely pleased with the company’s recent changes including a surprisingly strong quarter combined with some moves like shareholder buybacks, disbanding the M&A group and cost reduction strategies (which partly translated to laying off 10% of the staff). But this doesn’t necessarily mean that Elliott’s work is done with the company, a person familiar with the agreement told TechCrunch+. Surprisingly, the terms between the two companies doesn’t include a standstill agreement. There wasn’t even an information-sharing agreement or any type of legal document prohibiting Elliott from speaking badly about the company, talking to the press or anything like that. “So Elliott established an ongoing relationship. That doesn’t mean it’s walking away or never going to come back,” said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the company. “Like I said, with the freedom of no standstill if everything goes south a month from now or a couple of months from now, the firm can always come back and say, ‘You know, we’re still watching. We’re still involved, and here’s what we think you should do to make it better.’ Elliott doesn’t want that to happen. But that is a possibility that could happen.” All of that gives Elliott a lot of leeway to continue to pressure the company should circumstances warrant it. But for now, at least, Salesforce appears to have appeased the activist firm, and it has the activists off its back ahead of the stockholder’s meeting in June."

5,Snap signs new music licensing deals to expand its Sounds library,['@indianidle'],"April 13, 2023","Snap has signed a deal with multiple music labels to expand its Sounds library, the social app’s product that lets people use song clips in Snaps and Stories. The company said participating labels include U.S.-based UnitedMasters, Netherlands-based BUMA/STEMRA and SUISA Digital Licensing AG. This includes a repertoire of IP bodies including SUISA: Switzerland, AKKA/LAA: Latvia, Albautor: Albania, Armauthor: Armenia, Autodia: Greece, COMP: Pakistan, EAÜ: Estonia, GCA: Georgia, LATGA: Lithuania, SOZA: Slovakia, Abramus Digital: Brazil, Soundreef: Italy and multiple direct-licensing publishers. A “selection” of work from singers and songwriters signed up with UnitedMasters will be available in the SoundLibrary, Snap said. Plus, BUMA/STEMRA and SUISA Digital’s library will add sounds from local artists. “We are excited to expand the Snapchat Sounds experience as we continue building new tools and developing music industry relationships globally,” said Ted Suh, global head of Music Partnerships at Snap said in a statement. “By offering a wider selection of music, we want to enable discovery and make it easier for Snapchatters around the world to express themselves creatively with the music they love.” The company said that emerging artists working with UnitedMasters will be eligible for grants through the Sounds Creator Fund. Snap started this program last year in partnership with DistroKit to award up to $100,000 per month (or $5,000 to 20 songs per month to upcoming musicians.) This grant also provides creative support to artists in establishing “relevancy” with the audience. Snap includes popular licensed songs in Sounds playlists so people can use them in the video clips on the platform. With the inclusion of new artists through this label deal, there will be more competition to get into those 20 spots. Snap first debuted the Sounds product in 2020 in response to TikTok becoming a hotbed for music discovery. Over the years, the company has inked deals with multiple labels, including Warner Music Group, Merlin (including their independent label members), NMPA, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Chappell Music, Kobalt BMG Music Publishing and Universal Music Group. Additionally, it has content from over 9,000 independent music publishers and labels in its library. Earlier this year, YouTube made a new music licensing tool called Creator Music available to all YouTube Partnership Program participants in the U.S."
6,JB Straubel could return to Tesla – as a board member this time,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 6, 2023","Tesla has nominated JB Straubel, the company’s former CTO who is now running his own startup Redwood Materials, as its next independent board member. The company said in a regulatory filing Thursday that Straubel, if elected by shareholders (which is almost a certainty) would take over the spot vacated by Hiromichi Mizuno, the former chief investment officer of Japan’s $1.5 trillion pension fund. Mizuno joined the board and its audit committee in 2020 and will not stand for re-election. “Thank you Elon and the Tesla board for the nomination; it’s an honor to be considered and to help the sustainable energy transition in as many ways as I can,” Straubel said in a note to TechCrunch. Straubel, who joined Tesla in 2004 and was CTO for 14 years, was largely viewed as the quiet steady hand behind its controversial CEO Elon Musk. Straubel’s role at Tesla cannot be understated. The executive was responsible for some of the company’s most important technology, notably around batteries. His understated yet steady presence along with his technological acumen gave provided stability even when its CEO became embroiled in controversy. During his tenure at Tesla, Straubel led the construction and concept of Gigafactory Nevada and the production ramp of its Model 3 sedan. Straubel left Tesla in 2019. Drew Baglino, vice president of technology, took over his duties. At the time, Tesla said Straubel would stay on in a senior advisor role. After Straubel left the automaker he threw himself into scaling Redwood Materials, a battery materials supplier and recycler that was founded in 2017. Redwood Materials, which is based in Carson City, Nevada, has since landed hundreds of millions in corporate and venture capital and locked in several high-profile customer deals with companies like Panasonic and Amazon. Tesla’s shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 16."
7,"Apple’s high security mode blocked NSO spyware, researchers say",['@lorenzofb'],"April 18, 2023","Last year, Apple launched a new feature for iPhone users who are worried about getting targeted with sophisticated spyware, such as journalists or human rights defenders. Now, researchers say they have found evidence that the feature — called Lockdown Mode — helped block an attack by hackers using spyware made by the infamous mercenary hacking provider NSO Group. On Tuesday, the cybersecurity and human rights research group Citizen Lab released a report analyzing three new zero-day exploits in iOS 15 and iOS 16 — meaning Apple was unaware of the vulnerabilities at the time they were used to target at least two Mexican human rights defenders. One of those exploits was blocked by Lockdown Mode, the researchers found. Lockdown Mode was specifically designed to reduce the iPhone’s attack surface — cybersecurity lingo referring to parts of the code or features of a system prone to attacks by hackers. This is the first documented case where Lockdown Mode has successfully protected someone from a targeted attack. In the recent cases, Citizen Lab researchers said that the targets’ iPhones blocked the hacking attempts and showed a notification saying Lockdown Mode prevented someone from accessing the phone’s Home app. The researchers, however, note that it’s possible that at some point NSO’s exploit developers “may have figured out a way to correct the notification issue, such as by fingerprinting Lockdown Mode.” As other researchers have pointed out in the past, it’s easy to fingerprint users to determine who has Lockdown Mode turned on, but that’s not to say its protections are not meaningful. As this case found by Citizen Lab shows, Lockdown Mode can be effective. “The fact that Lockdown Mode seems to have thwarted, and even notified targets of a real-world zero-click attack shows that it is a powerful mitigation, and is a cause for great optimism,” Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab and one of the authors of the report, told TechCrunch. “But, as with any optional feature, the devil is always in the details. How many people will opt to turn on Lockdown Mode? Will attackers simply move away from exploiting Apple apps and target third-party apps, which are harder for Lockdown Mode to secure?” Apple spokesperson Scott Radcliffe said in a statement: “We are pleased to see that Lockdown Mode disrupted this sophisticated attack and alerted users immediately, even before the specific threat was known to Apple and security researchers. Our security teams around the world will continue to work tirelessly to advance Lockdown Mode and strengthen the security and privacy protections in iOS.” NSO Group spokesperson Liron Bruck did not respond to a series of questions, instead sending a statement saying that “Citizen Lab has repeatedly produced reports that are unable to determine the technology in use and they refuse to share their underlying data. NSO adheres to strict regulation and its technology is used by its governmental customers to fight terror and crime around the world.” Citizen Lab’s report identified three different exploits — all “zero-click,” meaning they did not require any interaction by the target — by analyzing several phones that were suspected to have been hacked with NSO’s spyware, also known as Pegasus. Pegasus, which NSO sells exclusively to government customers, can remotely obtain a phone’s location, messages, photos and virtually anything the phone’s legitimate owner can access. For years, researchers at Citizen Lab, Amnesty International and other organizations have documented several cases where NSO customers used the company’s spyware to target journalists, human rights defenders and opposition politicians. Citizen Lab’s new findings show that NSO is still alive and well, despite a rocky past couple of years. In 2021, an international consortium of media organizations launched the Pegasus Project, a series of articles detailing scandals involving NSO all over the world. Then, later that year, the U.S. government put NSO on a denylist, effectively barring any U.S. company or individual from doing business with the company. “Other companies have folded, but, at least for now, NSO is still able to bear these increased costs, and Pegasus remains an active threat to global civil society,” Marczak said. Of the recent batch of exploits: The first exploit was deployed in January 2022 by NSO customers and exploited the iPhone’s FindMy feature, which helps owners locate their lost or stolen phones. The second exploit deployed starting in June 2022 and is a “two-step” exploit, meaning it targets two features, in this case the FindMy feature and iMessage. And the last exploit, deployed starting in October 2022 exploited the iPhone’s HomeKit and iMessage functionalities. In its report, Citizen Lab said the two Mexicans targeted by the exploits investigate human rights violations allegedly carried out by the Mexican military. The Mexican government is a known spyware customer. Citizen Lab reported all these exploits to Apple, which have since then pushed updates and reduced the attack surface. Apple fixed the HomeKit-based vulnerability in iOS 16.3.1, released in February. Do you have more information about NSO Group? Or another surveillance tech provider? We’d love to hear from you.

8,Kia aims to reach $122B gross revenue by 2030,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 5, 2023","A year after Kia unveiled its roadmap to sustainable mobility by 2030, the Hyundai-owned brand has upped the ante. At the company’s 2023 CEO Investor Day on Wednesday, Kia’s leadership said the company aims to reach KRW 160 trillion ($122 billion) in gross revenue by 2030. The financial goal is part of a general update of Kia’s future-focused strategy, “Plan S,” which launched in 2020 and featured new branding. Wednesday’s update also includes a KRW 32 trillion ($24 billion) investment into the automaker’s electrification strategy, with 45% of that money dedicated to “future business areas.” The funds should help Kia nudge its output up over the next few years. Kia hiked its global sales goal to 4.3 million units from 4 million units by 2030, and its annual EV sales goal to 1.6 million units from 1.2 million units by 2030. That’ll be quite the ramp from where Kia is today. The company is targeting 258,000 EV sales by 2023 and 1 million units by 2026, which will be 8% and 25% of all Kia sales, respectively. By next year, the company said it will begin operating its first dedicated EV factory at Gwangmyeong. Kia also said it will release 15 new EV models by 2027, which is one more model than the company had promised last year. One of those models is expected to be a purpose-built, mid-sized SUV, which Kia is aiming to launch by 2025. For what purpose it’s being built, Kia didn’t say.   The Korean automaker recently revealed the newest EV in its portfolio, the EV9 SUV, which is packed with tech and will go on sale in selected markets in the second half of this year. All of Kia’s upcoming vehicles will be tech-focused, the company said. By 2025, Kia said all new models will be connected to the company’s “connected car data cloud,” which should enable over-the-air updates and allow customers to personalize their vehicles. The company is also promising to focus on its brand of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), AutoMode, which is debuting on the EV9. Kia is pushing its ADAS one step further with HDP (Highway Driving Pilot), which it describes as a Level 3 autonomous driving technology “that does not require human steering wheel control for certain road sections, such as highways,” and will also debut with the EV9 this year. As part of its autonomy roadmap, Kia said by next year, the company plans to use OTA updates to bring drivers more “eye-off” or hands-free functions, and in 2026, it’ll release HDP2, which uses “high precision navigation.” Alongside its first purpose-built SUV that Kia aims to launch by 2025, the company has officially established a purpose-built vehicle (PBV) business structure, with a dedicated lineup of vehicles for various commercial needs. The company aims to develop a solution that can manage data, software and charging for the PBVs. Kia said it believes the PBV unit will be one of its key future businesses. As such, it is building a dedicated factory in Hwaseong, which will build medium-sized vehicles for a variety of vehicles and will be unveiled in 2025. The PBVs will be based on a “flat skateboard-type platform, allowing the size and shape to be adjusted according” to a business partner’s purpose and needs. Kia will gradually expand its PBV lineup to include a robotaxi, a small vehicle for delivering goods or food, and a large vehicle that can “replace public transportation or be used as a mobile office,” the company said.

10,"YouTube Premium adds more perks with SharePlay support, higher quality video and more",['@sarahintampa'],"April 10, 2023","YouTube Premium, the $11.99 per month ad-free version of YouTube, is today introducing a number of new features aimed at attracting and retaining subscribers. Most notably, the subscription plan will now include higher-quality video for web and iOS users, support for co-watching videos on FaceTime through Apple’s SharePlay and other controls for managing your queue on mobile devices. The company believes the broader feature set will help it to better market the subscription to consumers, as many don’t know what else YouTube Premium provides beyond removing ads from YouTube. The launches also follow other recent additions, like the ability to continue watching videos where you left off on any device and a “smart downloads” feature that automatically saves recommended videos for offline access. This latter feature is now available to web users as well, in addition to iOS and Android. Image Credits: YouTube’s “continue watching” feature Image Credits: YouTube’s “continue watching” feature While many of these earlier features had more subtly enhanced the YouTube Premium subscription — running in the background where they’re perhaps unnoticed by the end user — today’s newly announced additions will be more front-and-center to the viewing experience. For starters, YouTube will begin rolling out an enhanced bitrate version of 1080p HD video quality to Premium subscribers on iOS and then the web in the weeks ahead. (On the web, it will first become available as an “experiment.” To clarify, this is not one of the experiments in YouTube Premium’s offering that allows subscribers early access to test new features ahead of a public release.) While all YouTube users will continue to have access to 1080p, the enhanced 1080p quality setting will make videos look “extra crisp and clear,” YouTube says, including those that have lots of detail and motion, like sports and gaming. If successfully implemented, this could help YouTube Premium to better live up to its name in terms of providing a “premium” experience to subscribers, not just a less annoying one by removing ads. Image Credits: YouTube Image Credits: YouTube Another key addition is support for Apple’s SharePlay, first introduced at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in 2021. Though other video services have long supported SharePlay, including competitors like Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max and TikTok, YouTube will limit access so only paying subscribers can use the co-viewing feature. That positions the service in a different space from rival TikTok, which was among the first to support Apple’s co-watching feature for FaceTime users. Of course, SharePlay to some extent now feels more like a pandemic-era solution designed to connect people who can’t be together in real life. Netflix, for instance, never even bothered to launch its own official co-viewing option, after apparently betting on declining usage for such a thing as COVID restrictions lifted. So it’s interesting to see YouTube try to market SharePlay as a “perk” rather than standard functionality, particularly when its in-house co-viewing solution within Google Meet already allows YouTube co-viewing without the Premium upgrade for all users. (YouTube says Premium users are the only ones who can initiate in Google Meet, but anyone including non-subscribers can view). Another new feature provides more controls over your queue when subscribed to YouTube Premium. Starting today, Premium users will be able to add videos to their queue when watching on phones and tablets. While today YouTube free users can save videos to playlists, including “Watch Later,” queuing lets users control what video they want to play next during their current viewing session. Image Credits: YouTube Image Credits: YouTube The updates join other YouTube Premium features which, beyond ad-free viewing, include background play for watching when the screen is locked, offline downloads and access to YouTube Music Premium. Correction, 11 am ET: High bitrate for web will be an experiment, YouTube says, but will not be listed on the experiments page at YouTube.com/new. We also further clarified the requirements for YouTube over Google Meet.  "
11,Apple partners with Canal+ to bring Apple TV+ content to all subscribers,['@romaindillet'],"April 14, 2023","Apple has signed a multiyear deal with Canal+, a leading French premium television channel and streaming service. Starting on April 20, all existing and future Canal+ subscribers in France and some other European countries will be able to stream Apple TV+ content for no additional cost. This is an odd deal as Canal+ isn’t just bundling Apple TV+ in its offerings. It doesn’t work like carrier deals — telecom companies often offer a few months of Apple TV+, Disney+ or Netflix with their most expensive subscription plans. Instead, Apple TV+ content will be available in the Canal+ app directly (myCanal). Some shows, like “The Morning Show,” “Foundation” and “Tehran” will even be broadcasted on Canal+’s premium TV channels for people who still watch live TV. On Twitter, Canal+ says that its subscribers won’t be able to access Apple TV+ from the Apple TV app. This will still require a separate subscription — but I don’t see why people would pay to access content that they can already stream in a different app. In an interview with Variety, Apple’s senior VP of services Eddy Cue said that this isn’t just a temporary deal to boost Apple TV+ in France. “It’s not a promotion and it’s not a one-time thing. It’s a many-years thing and hopefully something that lasts for forever in my mind,” Cue told Variety. But the timing of the announcement is interesting. Apple TV+ has been available since 2019 and is estimated to have 25 million paid subscribers. But it’s unclear if Apple managed to attract a ton of subscribers outside of its home country. Unlike Netflix, there isn’t a lot of international content available on the service. Apple launched its first French TV show recently, “Liaison,” and a French-Japanese show is going to premiere on April 21. By partnering with a local player like Canal+, Apple will be able to reach a much wider audience. In France alone, Canal+ has 9.5 million subscribers. Canal+ is also available in several European and African countries. It has more than 25 million paid subscribers in total. Canal+ and Apple have known each other for a while. In 2020, Bloomberg reported that some video apps can sell shows on Apple platforms without paying the standard in-app purchase fees. Apple doesn’t take a 30% cut on payments for content rentals or purchases in Amazon Prime Video, Canal+ and Altice One if users already have a payment method associated with their account."
12,"Roku touts its new ad products, including an AI that matches campaigns to TV moments",['@sarahintampa'],"May 2, 2023","In Roku’s recent quarter, the company posted better-than-expected revenue of $741 million, but worried investors with its warning of an uncertain ad market and declining average revenue per user. Today, at the IAB NewFronts, the streaming media company introduced its latest ad products to potentially help it address the latter, at least. These included new opportunities to advertise on Roku’s Home Screen, within its original content, and even in its screensaver, among other things. It also hyped its use of contextual AI for automatically running ads right next to the most relevant moments in shows and movies on The Roku Channel. The company explained that its new artificial intelligence capability searches across the Roku library for “iconic plot moments” that would match a brand’s message and place their ads in real time. To work, marketers will first tell Roku their campaign’s theme. The AI searches the library to match the campaign with key moments. For example, when Tim Gunn says “make it work” in “Project Runway,” an apparel brand could insert its message. Roku also announced a new slate of Roku Originals, which will include an entrepreneurship docuseries, “Side Hustlers,” produced by Hello Sunshine — Reese Witherspoon’s media company that sold in 2021 for $900 million to Candle Media, the company run by former Disney execs Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, which now has its hand in numerous pies across the streaming landscape. Digital bank Ally was also involved in this production that focuses on people turning their side hustle into their main business. Image Credits: Roku Image Credits: Roku Other new Originals arriving this year include “Celebrity Family Cook Off,” a series executive produced by Sofia Vergara and hosted by Manolo Gonzalez Vergara and “Carpe DM with Juanpa,” which will feature social media star Juanpa Zurita, among others.  Roku said it’s also renewing “The Great American Baking Show,” featuring Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Ellie Kemper and Zach Cherry and “Honest Renovations,” featuring Jessica Alba and Lizzy Mathis. The company claimed its Originals were delivering better than cable, and even better than broadcast audiences every day.  The streaming company additionally used its time to pitch marketers about how to reach its now 71.6 million active accounts on its service via new ad products and placements. The pitch, delivered by Roku Media President Charlie Collier, touted Roku’s reach in the U.S. “Americans spend more time on Roku than any other TV platform, which means they spend more time here with Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ and even more time streaming CBS, NBC ABC, and Fox,” Collier told the audience. “Think about this: 50% of all Super Bowl streaming took place on Roku this year,” he added. Image Credits: Roku Image Credits: Roku During the event, Roku shared some of its latest ad deals. It noted that its screensaver “Roku City,” which floats a cityscape on the TV screen while the TV is idle, will open up to brands. While before, the city screensaver would point users to suggested content to stream, it will now be able to feature other brands, as well. This summer, it will feature McDonald’s brand as part of the artwork, for instance, as its first brand partner on the new ad offering. The screensaver is used by nearly 40 million homes, Roku said. The company also introduced new discovery experiences that allow brands to host content in areas like Home & Garden and Sports experiences that curate content from across TV on the Roku Home Screen. Now, when users turn to Roku search, they may see a featured collection that’s “presented by” an ad partner — for example, Walmart was shown “presenting” the Home & Garden collection. Image Credits: Roku Image Credits: Roku Image Credits: Roku Image Credits: Roku Roku also shared that Instacart was its latest Commerce+ partner, joining others like Walmart, Best Buy, Cox Automotive, DoorDash, Kroger and more on its shoppable ads and other retailer-focused initiatives. Commerce+ is designed to shorten the path to purchase for consumers, Roku explained. For example, Wendy’s offered Roku users $5 off powered by DoorDash via a Home Screen ad, then used DoorDash data to help measure the impact of their ad spend. The campaign grew Wendy’s order size mainly among new and lapsed users and delivered a positive return on investment many times over, the company said. Other news for marketers included Roku’s introduction of a Primetime Reach Guarantee, which it claimed to be a “first” in streaming. Essentially, the guarantee commits to brands they’ll be able to reach more TV households in primetime than the average program airing on a top-five cable channel on traditional TV. “We’re uniquely positioned to make brands unmissable in TV because Roku is not fighting for turf in streaming—we are the turf,” said Alison Levin, Roku’s vice president of Ad Revenue and Marketing Solutions, in a press release. “We’re bringing the entire power of the platform, not just the pieces, to give marketers more of the scale, delight, and flexibility that they love in TV.”"
13,"YouTube continues to see ad revenue decline, 2.6% drop YOY",['@laurenforristal'],"April 25, 2023","Alphabet reported Tuesday its latest earnings, citing that YouTube saw ad revenue fall 2.6% year over year as advertisers pulled back from the platform due to economic uncertainty. YouTube only raked in $6.69 billion in advertising revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 compared to the $6.87 billion during the same period last year. Despite the disappointing number, YouTube managed to slightly beat analysts’ expectations of $6.6 billion. This is the third quarter in a row that YouTube’s ad revenue decreased. The downward sliding figures are a cause of concern for content creators, who look to ad revenue to earn income. The company attempted to offer reassurance during Tuesday’s earnings call, choosing to focus on its success with the short-form video feature Shorts. “Last year the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts posts,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet said. As the platform experiences intense competition from rivals like TikTok, the company continues to focus on the Shorts to boost its growth. In November 2022, YouTube rolled out Shorts to smart TVs. Google announced in February that Shorts has reached 50 billion daily views. “We’re seeing strong watch time, growth… monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates,” added Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer. YouTube also reiterated plans to ramp up its efforts to make YouTube more shoppable. The company partnered with Shopify last year to enable YouTubers and merchants to feature products on their channels. “Shopping on YouTube… It’s still super early days. One highlight last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We’re excited about the potential ahead,” Schindler said. The company confirmed to TechCrunch in November that it plans to add shopping features to Shorts. Overall, parent company Alphabet reported $69.8 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2023, a 3% increase from the same year-ago period. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki stepped down from her role in February, taking on an advisory role across Google and Alphabet. Neal Mohan, chief product officer, is the new CEO. In January, Alphabet cut 6% of its workforce, which affected 12,000 employees.  "
14,Evermile raises $6M seed to make local deliveries more economic for small businesses,['@mikebutcher'],"April 19, 2023","Local retailers have to manage delivery providers themselves or build in-house. Both are expensive and complex. Delivery providers include DPD, Royal Mail, Hived and Veho. U.K. startup Evermile claims to simplify and automate deliveries, bringing enterprise-grade logistics to small businesses. It’s now raised $6 million in a seed funding round led by 10D with participation from Mensch Capital Partners and various angel investors, including Fred Destin (ex-board member at Deliveroo), Ziv Paz (co-founder of Melio) and others. The company says it has an optimization engine that analyzes the options and chooses the provider with the most competitive price and performance scores. It claims this can reduce delivery costs by 30% to 50%, and make deliveries economic for small businesses, by matching merchants to the right partner for each delivery task. Built by former Via and Optibus executives (Omer Goldschmidt, Omry Hochberg and Ynon Cohen), Evermile now says it has 300+ local merchants across the U.K. (pharmacies, flower shops, wine stores, local bakeries) using the platform. Omer Goldschmidt, Evermile CEO and co-founder, said the platform also takes full ownership over the delivery promise. They will have their work cut out for them.

15,Uber Freight offers carriers a fuel card powered by startup AtoB,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 27, 2023","Uber Freight, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, is partnering with transportation fintech startup AtoB to offer carriers fuel cards and spend management software. AtoB, a four-year-old company that has been described as Stripe for transportation, offers an integrated financial platform based around its core product of a fuel card for truckers. Unlike other fuel cards offered by competitors like Brex and Fleetcor, AtoB’s fuel card is based on the Visa platform, so payments are more likely to be accepted at a wider range of fuel retailers. There are also no hidden or annual fees, according to the company. While the carrier fuel card and spend management software will be integrated directly with Uber Freight’s product and platform, it will be powered by AtoB. Truckers will be able to access exclusive fuel discounts at participating truck stops, free same-day payouts on Uber Freight loads and streamlined expense reporting and controls, according to AtoB. AtoB offers two versions of its fuel card: the Flex Card and Unlimited. The former is a charge card with a credit line, and the latter is a prepaid card. The startup says the prepaid card gets approved regardless of credit score, and can help businesses build credit. AtoB’s fuel card also addresses fuel theft, which the company says is a major cost driver for fleets. Telematics location tracking and fuel-level tracking help AtoB note both if a card is being used far away from the assigned vehicle and if the card is being used too soon after fueling and block transactions to prevent theft and fraud. AtoB was founded in 2019 with a mission to help alleviate the trucker shortage by solving some of the industry’s biggest pain points: outdated and unreliable fuel cards, and outdated and broken payroll. In just four years, AtoB has scaled to a network of 25,000 businesses and 100,000 truck drivers in the U.S. The partnership with Uber Freight will give AtoB access to the logistic company’s 100,000 carriers and thousands of shippers. “Carriers need innovative tools and solutions to build thriving businesses, maximizing their time and earnings potential on the road,” said Uber Freight CEO Lior Ron in a statement. “Since our beginning, Uber Freight has brought much-needed transformation to the industry. We’ve introduced driver-first carrier solutions that improve the economics of truck ownership for the thousands of drivers on our platform. Now more than ever, carriers need a solution that simplifies finances, brings same-day payments to wallets, and supports better cash flow management for the future.” Uber Freight has consistently tapped startups to beef up its business and integrate new tech solutions. While the partnership with AtoB seems to acknowledge that human truckers aren’t going anywhere just yet, Uber Freight has also secured partnerships with autonomous trucking companies like Aurora and Waymo Via in recent years. As carriers on Uber Freight’s platform inevitably go electric in the future, AtoB says its platform can also support fleet transitions to electric and next-gen clean fuels.  "
16,WhatsApp users in Brazil can now pay merchants through the app,['@indianidle'],"April 11, 2023","WhatsApp is introducing the ability for users to directly pay businesses through chat in Brazil. This means that people in the country can have end-to-end shopping experiences, from discovery to payments, within the app. This move finally unlocks the merchant payment market in Brazil for WhatsApp. Mark Zuckerberg made this announcement in a post saying that the company is rolling out the ability for users to “pay local businesses right in a WhatsApp chat.” “This seamless and secure checkout experience will be a game-changer for people and small businesses looking to buy and sell on WhatsApp without having to go to a website, open another app or pay in person. We’re rolling out today to a small number of businesses and will be available to many more in the coming months,” the company said in the announcement. Until now, users were able to make peer-to-peer transactions through WhatsApp Pay in Brazil. But due to regulatory restrictions, Meta wasn’t able to roll out this ability to make purchases through merchants. Shops could use a third-party payment service to generate a payment link and include it in a WhatsApp message — but this wasn’t a seamless experience for either the merchant or the shopper. There is no data on how many small businesses there are on WhatsApp right now. The company last announced in 2020 that more than 5 million businesses in Brazil use WhatsApp. Last year, WhatsApp rolled out a Yellow Pages-like “Directory” feature in Brazil that allowed users to search for different kinds of businesses, ranging from food and drink to travel. Combining these two capabilities, users can search for different businesses, add items they want to buy, and pay the merchant within the app. WhatsApp said that users can make a payment through Mastercard and Visa debit, credit and pre-paid cards issued by “numerous” participating banks. To accept these payments, businesses can link a service provider like Cielo, Mercado Pago or Rede to their account. These companies had already built the technical infrastructure for peer-to-peer payment over WhatsApp in Brazil. The company debuted an end-to-end shopping experience with Reliance Jio in India, letting customers order groceries through the app. According to reports, JioMart saw an uptick in active users coming to shop through WhatsApp. In February, Zuckerberg declared that this is a “year of efficiency” for Meta, signaling that the company would concentrate on cutting costs and generating more revenue. So this is the right time for debuting merchant payment services in the country with more than 120 million WhatsApp users. In the past few years, people in Brazil have rapidly adopted digital payments. Data suggests that by last year, more than 124 million people were using Pix — an instant payment platform managed by the country’s central bank."
17,New York’s mayor wants you to know how much he loves police robots,['@bheater'],"April 11, 2023","Former cop and self-declared “geek” Eric Adams held a press conference in Times Square today to let the city know how much he loves police robots. New York City’s mayor presided over a press conference alongside police officials to discuss a pair of pilots designed to increase the city’s surveillance. “I’ve stated this from day one, even when I was on the campaign trail: I’m a computer geek. I believe that technology is here,” the mayor said at the top of his remarks. “We can’t be afraid of it, and as [NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell] stated, transparency is the key.” At the top of the list is Digidog — a pet name the police gave to a Boston Dynamics Spot robot. The system was greeted with a fierce public backlash when it was unveiled back in 2021, following its deployment at public housing in Manhattan. “People had figured out the catchphrases and the language to somehow make this evil,” NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said at the time. The pilot was ultimately pulled after a couple of months, over fears of profiling and increased surveillance. “It was something that was introduced previously, under a previous administration and a few loud people were opposed to it, and we took a step back,” Adams noted at today’s event. “That is not how I operate. I operate on looking at what’s best for the city.” The NYPD innovates. Always. Join us in Times Square. https://t.co/hfgSrYcSHy — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) April 11, 2023  Spot will be joined by K5, Knightscope’s egg-shaped robot, which you’ve probably seen at shopping malls. The well-funded robotics firm has aggressively been targeting law enforcement with its products, and a nod from New York City is obviously a big vote of confidence (though, again, this is currently a pilot). Also included in the announcement is StarChase’s GPS system, which can be used to track vehicles remotely. The Spot robots run $75,000 a piece, while K5 is generally quoted at between $60,000-70,000 a year to lease. The news comes roughly a week after Adams announced massive pay raises for officers. The raises of 2.25-4% will be retroactively applied back to August 1, 2017. A week prior, the Mayor announced sweeping cuts to the New York Public Library system amounting to $36.2 million. These moves come amid media criticism over New York City’s crime rate. According to a recent study, NYC currently ranks as the fifth-safest city in the U.S. with a population over 300,000. Late last year, the San Francisco Police Department drew national scrutiny for a clause allowing their police robots to use “justified” deadly force. The section reads, “Robots will only be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD.” That move was reversed the following week. Wow so many human New Yawkers have come out to see us! Almost show time – press conference! $KSCP #publicsafety #innovation #nyc pic.twitter.com/mM1fynnz9L — Knightscope (@iKnightscope) April 11, 2023  As with the robots being rolled out by the NYPD, none of the SFPD’s robots were designed to kill. However, in 2016, Dallas became the first U.S. police department to kill a suspect with a robot, by planting an explosive to a bomb detecting system. A month prior to the initial San Francisco news, Boston Dynamics joined four other leading firms in signing a pledge to not allow for the weaponization of their general-purpose robots. The open letter noted: We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues. Weaponized applications of these newly-capable robots will also harm public trust in the technology in ways that damage the tremendous benefits they will bring to society. New York’s Mayor is, however, certainly bullish on their use as surveillance systems. Adams cited pushback to fingerprinting, post-9/11 policing measures and the CompStat to vocal concerns around the implementation of these new robotic policing systems. He explained, “This is the beginning of a series of rollouts we were going to do to show how public safety has transformed itself,” noting that Spot and K5 are “just the beginning.” Addressing a question from the audience, Adams added, “Digidog is now out of the pound.”"
18,Deep Agency shows the perils of applying AI to the fashion industry,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 27, 2023","Generative AI is disrupting industries — with understandable controversy. Earlier this month, Danny Postma, the founder of Headlime, an AI-powered marketing copy startup that was recently acquired by Jasper, announced Deep Agency, a platform he describes as an “AI photo studio and modeling agency.” Using art-generating AI, Deep Agency creates and offers “virtual models” for hire starting at $29 per month (for a limited time), letting customers place the models against digital backdrops to realize their photoshoots. “What is Deep Agency? It’s a photo studio, with a few big differences,” Postma explained in a series of tweets. “No camera. No real people. No physical location … What’s this good for? Tons of things, like automating content for social media influencers, models for marketeers’ ads and ecommerce product photography.” Deep Agency is very much in the proof-of-concept phase, which is to say… a tad borked. There’s a lot of artifacting in the models’ faces, and the platform places guardrails — intentional or not — around which physiques can be generated. At the same time, Deep Agency’s model creation is strangely hard to control; try generating a female model dressed in a particular outfit, like a police officer’s, and Deep Agency simply can’t do it. Nevertheless, the reaction to the launch was swift — and mixed. Some Twitter users applauded the tech, expressing an interest in using it for modeling clothing and apparel brands. Others accused Postma of pursing a “deeply unethical” business model, scraping other peoples’ photography and likenesses and selling it for profit. The divide reflects the broader debate over generative AI, which continues to attract astounding levels of funding while raising a host of moral, ethical and legal issues. According to PitchBook, investments in generative AI will reach $42.6 billion in 2023 and skyrocket to $98.1 billion by 2026. But companies including OpenAI, Midjourney and Stability AI are currently embroiled in lawsuits over their generative AI technologies, which some accuse of replicating the works of artists without fairly compensating them. Image Credits: Deep Agency Image Credits: Deep Agency Deep Agency seems to have especially touched a nerve because of the application — and implications — of its product. Postma, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, isn’t shy about the fact that the platform could compete with — and perhaps harm the livelihoods of — real-world models and photographers. While some platforms like Shutterstock have created funds to share revenue from AI-generated art with artists, Deep Agency has taken no such step — and hasn’t signaled that it intends to. Coincidentally, only weeks after Deep Agency’s debut, Levi’s announced that it would partner with design studio LaLaLand.ai to create customized AI-generated models to “increase the diversity of models shoppers can see wearing its products.” Levi’s stressed that it planned to use the synthetic models alongside human models and that the move wouldn’t impact its hiring plans. But it raised questions as to why the brand didn’t recruit more models with the diverse characteristics it’s seeking, given the difficulty these models have had finding opportunities in the fashion industry historically. (According to one survey, as of 2016, 78% of models in fashion adverts were white.) In an email interview with TechCrunch, Os Keyes, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington who studies ethical AI, made the observation that modeling and photography — and the arts in general — are areas particularly vulnerable to generative AI because photographers and artists lack structural power. They’re largely low-paid, independent contractors to large companies who look to cost-cut, Keyes notes. Models, for instance, are often on the hook for high agency commission fees (~20%) as well as business expenses, which can include plane tickets, group housing and the promotional materials required to land jobs with clients. “Postma’s app is — if it works — in fact designed to further kick the chair out from under already-precarious creative workers, and send the money to Postma, instead,” Keyes said. “That’s not really a thing to applaud, but it’s also not tremendously surprising … The fact of the matter is that socioeconomically, tools like this are designed to further core out and concentrate profit.” Other critics take issue with the underlying technology. State-of-the-art image-generating systems like the type Deep Agency uses are what’s known as “diffusion models,” which learn to create images from text prompts (e.g. “a sketch of a bird perched on a windowsill”) as they work their way through web-scraped training data. At issue in artists’ minds is diffusion models’ tendency to essentially copy and paste images — including copyrighted content — from the data that was used to train them. Image Credits: Deep Agency Image Credits: Deep Agency Companies commercializing diffusion models have long claimed that “fair use” protects them in the event that their systems were trained on licensed content. (Enshrined in U.S. law, fair use doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted material without first having to obtain permission from the rightsholder.) But artists allege that the models infringe on their rights, in part because the training data was sourced without their authorization or consent. “The legality of a startup like this isn’t entirely clear, but what is clear is that it’s aiming to put a lot of people out of work,” Mike Cook, an AI ethicist and member of the Knives and Paintbrushes open research group, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “It’s hard to talk about the ethics of tools like this without engaging with deeper issues relating to economics, capitalism and business.” There’s no mechanism for artists who suspect their art was used to train Deep Agency’s model to remove that art from the training dataset. That’s one worse than platforms like DeviantArt and Stability AI, which provide ways for artists to opt out of contributing art to train art-generating AI. Deep Agency also hasn’t said whether it’ll consider establishing a revenue share for artists and others whose work helped to create the platform’s model. Other vendors, such as Shutterstock, are experimenting with this, drawing on a combined pool to reimburse creators whose work is used to train AI art models. Cook points out another issue: data privacy. Deep Agency provides a way for customers to create a “digital twin” model by uploading around 20 images of a person in various poses. But uploading photos to Deep Agency also adds them to the training data for the platform’s higher-level models unless users explicitly delete them afterward, as outlined in the terms of service agreement. Deep Agency’s privacy policy doesn’t say exactly how the platform handles user-uploaded photos, in fact, or even where it stores them. And there’s seemingly no way to prevent rogue actors from creating a virtual twin of someone without their permission — a legitimate fear in light of the nonconsensual deepfake nudes models like Stable Diffusion have been used to create. Image Credits: Deep Agency Image Credits: Deep Agency “Their terms of use actually state that ‘You understand and acknowledge that similar or identical generations may be created by other people using their own prompts.’ This is quite amusing to me because the premise of the product is that everyone can have bespoke AI models that are unique every time,” Cook said. “In reality, they acknowledge the possibility that you may get exactly the same image as someone else did, and that your photos are fed to others for potential use as well. I can’t imagine a lot of big companies liking the prospect of either of these things.” Another problem with Deep Agency’s training data is the lack of transparency around the original set, Keyes says. That is to say, it’s not clear which images the model powering Deep Agency was trained on (although the jumbled watermarks in its images give clues) — which leaves open the possibility of algorithmic bias. A growing body of research has turned up racial, ethnic, gender and other forms of stereotyping in image-generating AI, including in the popular Stable Diffusion model developed with support from Stability AI. Just this month, researchers at AI startup Hugging Face and Leipzig University published a tool demonstrating that models including Stable Diffusion and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 tend to produce images of people that look white and male, especially when asked to depict people in positions of authority. According to Vice’s Chloe Xiang, Deep Agency only generates images of women unless you purchase a paid subscription — a problematic bias off the bat. Moreover, Xiang writes, the platform tends to skew toward creating blonde white female models even if you select an image of a woman of a different race or likeness in the pre-generated catalog. Changing a model’s look requires making additional, not-so-obvious adjustments.  “Image-generating AI is fundamentally flawed because it depends on the representativeness of the data the image-generating AI was trained on,” Keyes said. “If it predominantly includes white, Asian and light-skinned Black people, all the synthesis in the world won’t provide representation for darker-skinned people.” Despite the glaring issues with Deep Agency, Cook doesn’t see it or similar tools disappearing anytime soon. There’s simply too much money in the space, he says — and he’s not wrong. Beyond Deep Agency and LaLaLand.ai, startups like ZMO.ai and Surreal are securing big VC investments for tech that generate virtual fashion models, ethics be damned. “The tools aren’t really good enough yet, as anyone using the Deep Agency beta can see. But it’s only a matter of time,” Cook said. “Entrepreneurs and investors will keep banging their heads against opportunities like this until they find a way to make one of them work.”"
19,"Meta updates its avatars with new body shapes, hair and clothing",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 27, 2023","Meta announced today that it’s introducing new body shapes, improved hair and clothing textures to its avatars. The company also announced that more than one billion avatars have been created across its platforms. Starting this month, users will be able to choose from a wider range of body shape options, including two curvier body shapes. Meta says it’s updating some of its existing options to help differentiate them as well. Although Meta has previously allowed you to choose your avatar’s body type, the company says the old options were all quite similar, which is why it’s launching new ones. In addition, Meta has overhauled how an avatar’s hair, clothing and eyes appear in stickers, profile pictures, cover photos and more. “Sparing you the nitty-gritty technical breakdown, we’ve added additional detail and realism to both hair and clothing — meaning whether you’re rocking a clean fade and suit or bedhead and sweats, your avatar should pop a little better than before,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Solid glow-up, right? We’ve also tweaked our lighting model to add a little more of a reflective gleam to your eyes, making them sparkle and bring your personality to life.” Meta has also partnered with PUMA to bring seven new outfits to the Meta Avatars Store, which launched last year and lets you buy digital clothes for their avatars. The company first introduced avatars in 2020 as a way to compete with Snap’s Bitmoji and has been continuously updating them since. Most recently, Meta added more expressions, faces, skin tones and accessibility devices to avatars. Today’s announcement comes as Meta recently opened up Horizon Worlds to teen users in the U.S. and Canada, after previously restricting the social VR platform to users 18 years of age and above. The move came as lawmakers and children’s rights activists had urged Meta to abandon its plans to open up the platform to young users. The new also comes a day after despite big losses in its metaverse investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it a point to tell investors that he is not making a u-turn into the AI lane. Rather, he sees AI as technology that works in tandem with the metaverse.  "
20,"How to spot investment-worthy founders: Look for mindset, competence and confidence",[],"March 23, 2023","More than 102,000 workers in U.S.-based tech companies have already been laid off in mass job cuts in 2023, according to Crunchbase. Yet for early-stage startups, the outlook isn’t as bleak as the headlines make it out to be — conversely, there’s a huge opportunity for scrappy founders in a downturn. A down market can provide investors with better entry pricing, more time for proper diligence and bigger returns in the long run; early-stage venture capital should be more than prepared to bet on great entrepreneurs in 2023. Early-stage venture funding is unique. Unlike a Series B or C round, there isn’t a ton of data and metrics to review. Because of this, investors need to rely on the founders to convince them there is a market for their product and that they are the founders to make it happen. As we enter a market downturn, finding and cultivating investment-worthy founders is more important than ever. Whether to invest lies at the intersection of the founder or management team’s mindset, ability and motivation. Early-stage investors need to pick entrepreneurs with a growth mindset. It’s as simple as that. Early-stage investors need to pick entrepreneurs with a growth mindset. It’s as simple as that. Entrepreneurs that have a strong desire to learn, embrace challenges and aren’t easily knocked down, persist in the face of setbacks, learn from criticism, surround themselves with those that are experts in their field (and trust them), and find lessons and inspiration from other’s successes. As a fund, we want outsize returns. To deliver those outsize returns, we need to go after a significant total addressable market and challenge to be solved. For an investment that supports a venture outcome, we need to invest in a founder who can stay the course through inevitable challenges. You also need to be sure that the founder you’re investing in wants the same things and won’t bail out on the first exit offer. In early-stage companies, the focus or thesis can transform as often market conditions and demand for the solution do. That’s why, though opportunity sizing is important, it’s not the determining factor. Early-stage investors must rely on the entrepreneur’s mindset to deliver the outcome; numbers on a spreadsheet can’t do that. While a founder’s education and work experience come into play, it’s an entrepreneurial mindset that is essential. Willingness to take a risk or walk an untraditional path and ultimately learn from it are critical attributes. So is persistence and grit. Many founders we work with have past startup and founder experience, including some failures. A good entrepreneur is an outlier; they see things others don’t and are willing to go to the wall to back those beliefs. Questions we ask when sussing out a founder’s mindset include:"
21,ABL Space Systems scores $60M for rapid response launch for defense customers,['@breadfrom'],"March 24, 2023","Launch startup ABL Space Systems has landed a $60 million contract to build out its “responsive launch” operational capacity, as part of the U.S. Space Force and U.S. Air Force Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) program. The new funding, which equally matches government funding with private investment, comes as the company prepares for the second launch attempt of its RS1 rocket. In a statement, ABL said that a key challenge with responsive space launches “is breaking from the assumption of a pre-defined orbit, trajectory, and launch site.” For such missions, the company said it would build new operational capacity for short-notice launches. “We believe that operational flexibility is key to meeting the rapidly changing needs of our customers,” Eva Abramson, ABL’s head of strategic development, said in a statement. “This award will help us in further developing on-call launch capabilities to meet mission-driven payload, launch site and target orbit needs.” The U.S. Space Force has made strides in recent years to expand its Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) capabilities by working with private industry, and rocket startups in particular. Last October, the Space Force awarded Firefly Space a $17.6 million TacRS mission contract to launch this year. Under the terms of the agreement, the Space Force will give Firefly just 24 hours’ notice prior to launch. This new funding will likely be a boon for ABL as it gears up to attempt to launch its RS1 small rocket for a second time from the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Alaska’s Kodiak Island. The company made its first launch attempt in January, but the rocket was destroyed after all nine engines on the first stage shut down simultaneously. The vehicle hit the launch pad, but no personnel were injured. ABL has yet to announce the date of the next launch, but it’s already eyeing up expansion: Earlier this month, the Space Force granted the company dedicated launch space at Launch Complex 15 in Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Base."
22,Why some VCs bet on people over businesses,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 27, 2023"," It’s been tough to raise funds in the last few years for most sectors, and many VCs will tell you that a startup needs to have a killer product-market fit before getting that check. But Eric Tarczynski of Contrary Capital believes in investing in people over businesses, and the wisdom to this approach has been proven out with AtoB. AtoB actually started out as something akin to Uber for buses, but due to the strength of the founding team, the company was able to quickly pivot and become a platform that’s more like Stripe for transportation. It’s an integrated financial platform based around the core product of a fuel card for truckers. Since its founding in September 2019, AtoB has scaled to a network of 25,000 businesses and 100,000 truck drivers in the U.S. To give you an idea of how huge this potential market is, Harshita Arora, co-founder of the company, says she thinks AtoB has captured only around 5% of the market share in the U.S. and can already project for $100 million in revenue. Arora herself actually presents as the perfect example of why VCs might want to find the gems of the world and let them do their thing. Born and raised in India, the now 21-year-old founder dropped out of school when she was 14 to tackle more challenging pursuits. At 16, she founded the Crypto Price Tracker, which became an App Store hit and was acquired by Redwood City Ventures in 2018. In a startup world that has been defined by the so-called Boy Genius (AKA a hoodie-clad MIT dropout at whom VCs have historically thrown billions of dollars), Arora represents the future of investing in the next generation of Girl Geniuses. We hosted Arora and Tarczynski on TechCrunch Live to discuss why VCs should invest in people over businesses, red and green flags of founding teams, AtoB’s journey of building a product based on trucker pain points and more. You can watch a replay of the session here — and read on for highlights. Tarczynski had met Arora’s co-founder, Tushar Misra, around five years ago during Contrary’s early days. Misra was one of Uber India’s first employees and had moved to San Francisco to start a micromobility logistics company, in which Contrary invested. The company didn’t work out, but Misra impressed Tarczynski. “We told him we want to back whatever you do next, so just keep us posted,” said Tarczynski. A few years later, Misra joined the founding team at AtoB. The team was still working on the original idea, but Contrary was hooked by the people at this point. “We said, look we don’t care what it is. We don’t care whether it’s Uber for buses or Stripe for trucking. We think that the three of you are exceptional people, so we want to write a check and move on.” The way it played out with AtoB is emblematic of how Contrary likes to do things. Normally, VCs find out about startups when they put their hands up for funds, making for a transactional dynamic. “What if you could actually focus on identifying the person before the idea and get to know them and build a deep, authentic relationship with that person first? Then you can help them however you can and write that first check when they’re starting their company,” said Tarczynski. Given Arora’s unique and special story, she’s just the kind of founder an investor would want to keep tabs on, and Tarczynski says the VC world is hungry for more “Girl Geniuses.” When researching a founding team, step one for investors is often digging into each team member individually. What do their peers, colleagues and former managers think about them? Are they described as people of high character and strong work ethic? Once you have that idea, you can bring them together and consider how they might work as a team. “Sometimes we find founders that have really overlapping skill sets, so you have two people that maybe have more of a skillset of being a CEO type and they start to encroach on one another’s turf,” said Tarczynski. “Some of the best founding teams have very complementary skillsets, where you’re running in parallel on two or three different pieces of the business maybe with slight overlap and enough context to be able to push back, understand, give feedback, but not overstep boundaries.” Tarczynski said another major red flag is when founders constantly talk over one another, which is a “dead giveaway that this is clearly a group of people that don’t have the trust in one another yet.” Arora met her co-founders through “the magic of the internet.” Vignan Velivela, AtoB’s CEO, had reached out to Arora after reading an article about her. At the time, Velivela was an engineer at Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of General Motors. After a few months of connecting as friends, the two decided to start a transportation-focused company. Through their online networks, they found Misra and after a few conversations, knew it was a great fit because they each could tackle different problems. “Tushar [Misra] is really good at understanding how to build strong ops processes and get very deep into data to understand what is broken in something and take ownership of fixing it fast,” said Arora. “As an example, in Q4, Tushar took over our risk team and got us from contribution negative, highly negative actually, to being profitable.” Arora said she’s more product and engineering focused, always thinking about how to build a better product and for which customer segment. Velivela is strongest at long-term thinking, strategizing on what AtoB should build next in order to unlock more of the total addressable market and expand the growth opportunity. Like many good entrepreneurs, Arora and her team spent a lot of time going to truck stops and talking to hundreds of truck drivers about their problems. The average trucker is over 50 and thus not likely to be very tech-focused, so it’s not shocking that many of them are still using outdated fuel cards and payments systems. What was surprising, said Arora, was that payments were still a huge problem in 2020, particularly as many fuel card companies were already gaining steam. “The first thing that really stood out to us is around reliability. These fuel cards built by legacy companies like Brex and Fleetcor in particular are running completely outside Visa and Mastercard, so they don’t have the same level of acceptance and network time,” said Arora. “We as consumers or businesses take it for granted because it just works all the time, so that was a big eye opener for us, seeing how people have backup cards and backup cash.” Then the AtoB team discovered how broken driver payroll is. Arora said many that she spoke with are still paid through paper checks that don’t arrive for several days, and will take even longer to cash if a driver is away from home on a gig. Many truckers resort to payday loans for that reason, she said. “We thought, the technology for doing instant payouts already exists. We can just build this for this customer base easily.” Those two pain points got AtoB rolling with a roadmap that started with fuel cards built on universal acceptance and reliability, and then expanding into instant payroll for drivers. With bigger next-gen fleets, like car rental company Kyte, Arora says the pain points are even more visible with how they manage their fleets and deal with fuel theft and fuel optimization. Consider this: Even Amazon, giant of the tech world, uses Stripe to process a significant portion of its payments across Prime, Audible, Kindle, Amazon Pay, Buy with Prime and more in the U.S., Europe and Canada. That, Arora says, is because Amazon understands how complex payments are at scale and how important it is to get that expertise right. “I haven’t seen a ton of examples where a business successfully did payments on the side,” she said. There’s a lot of nuances and expertise in building a payments business, both around the core payments — like working with networks, banks and merchants — and around the risk of fraud and credit risk, particularly when customers open wallets and bank accounts under your platform. “The economics of payments is that if you are not good at risk of fraud, you lose the whole $100. But if you’re good at it and do the business as is, you will make 1% of that, so you will make $1,” said Arora. “For every mistake you make, there’s an asymmetry there.” Many startups look at problems in the trucking industry which have led to a driver shortage and think the solution is to automate trucking. But despite the hype of self-driving cars arriving at scale, we’re still quite a ways away. “The reality is, as a venture firm, we’re looking to invest in massive categories,” said Tarczynski. “And outside of maybe healthcare, there is perhaps no larger category than transportation writ large. And then if you look at payments within transportation, these are both massive categories. So you can very clearly see that in a bull case scenario, a company like AtoB is a multibillion-dollar company.” When you zoom in to AtoB specifically, Tarczynski sees a company that’s addressing a systemically broken financial system for fleets. And they’re doing it in a way that will enable them to run the entire stack, from the basics of purchasing and payroll to more next generation issues, as well, like fuel management and even EV charging eventually. Often early-stage startups find themselves wearing multiple hats as they build out the business, and Arora said AtoB was no different. “There was a time when we were doing too many things, from underwriting applications to building products to doing support,” she said. “I think at that point, where you’re multitasking and context switching so much, it became clear we needed more people…Like when you’re context switching between five, six things in the same day, that’s when you really need to hire.” That said, AtoB didn’t rush it. The team set a high bar and was patient with bringing on an early team that would really be a great fit. Arora suggested teams look at how much runway they have and then start by picking the two or three most important things that the company has to get right, and hire based on that. And when it comes to finding the right fit, it’s always good to bring in someone who has tackled the problem before or has expertise in that field."
23,UPDATED: Smoakland is testing a loophole to sell cannabis by credit card,['@Haje'],"March 30, 2023","What do you do when you have a very successful and popular product (marijuana) that is legal in some places, but federally has been a Schedule 1 drug since 1970? Well, you can’t rely on any national institutions as your business partners. One of the major places that shows up is in payments and payment processing; even after recreational cannabis became legal in 21 states and decriminalized in another dozen or so, cannabis has become largely a cash business. In a world that is increasingly cashless, that’s a problem for both consumers and businesses. Smoakland is currently beta-testing a loophole that lets its customers pay by credit card. The secret, it turns out, is crypto. “You’re not actually purchasing cannabis with a credit card,” says Jeff Dillon, managing director of Marketing at Smoakland. “You’re purchasing crypto, and then we immediately use the crypto to purchase cannabis, before cashing the crypto back out. That way, your credit card company knows users are purchasing crypto. Crypto doesn’t give a shit what you do with it. For my purpose, and for the purpose of the customer, [the payment processor has] no idea what’s going on.” Of course, cannabis is a higher-risk market, and Smoakland expects it needs customers to pay a bit more in processing costs, but the team believes the customers are willing to do that in order to go up in a blaze of convenient glory.   “Two to three percent is standard for e-commerce, if you open a Shopify account or something like that. We are probably around 5% with high risk. If we were to open a porn site, it could be even higher than that. We’re a little bit lower, because there’s still a physical transaction. Anything involving crypto is deemed high risk, and you’re going to be charged a higher rate for the risk,” Dillon explains. The Smoakland team says it is at the bleeding edge here, and wants to keep its cards close to its chest regarding who the exact payment processor is. The company says it is noticing fluctuations of average order size throughout the month, and is hoping that offering credit cards can help smooth out its peaks and troughs a little — but also to make its products available to customers who need them. It is hoping to do a full-scale launch of its credit card service on the 20th of April — known as 4/20, which, as a number, for various reasons, has become synonymous with marijuana. “We’re seeing this cash crunch, and a quasi-recession that we’re going into. You can really see that between pay periods the difference in average order size varies. I’m starting to kind of pick up on this trend: The first and 15th, people have a lot more money to spend, and the average order sizes are higher,” Dilon explains. “It’s in beta currently, and we hope to go after a full rollout for 4/20 to capture that market. So that’s a big push, trying to have credit cards available then, because it’s an off-week. People get paid on the 15th. Being able to offer credit cards for people who are on a bit of a tight budget, that’s even better.” The Smoakland team is aware, of course, that the products are used recreationally, but it believes it is on a bigger mission, describing its product as an “essential, critical medicine for people.” Among other things, the company is pushing on prices.   “In Oakland, you see our billboards and banners around,” says Dillon, comparing his company with Fred Franzia’s Two-Buck Chuck wine selling out of Trader Joe’s. “Franzia went to Paris and realized there’s great wine sold at normal prices. We do the same thing for cannabis, as the home of the $49 ounce.” It’ll be interesting to see whether Smoakland will be able to keep its payment processor up and running in the midst of a complicated set of pressures on the financial institutions, but the company isn’t overly worried, and suggests that the SAFE banking act is putting its thumb on the proverbial scales in the favor of what it is doing. UPDATE: It turns out that you can’t use this approach, and Smoakland are cancelling the trial. Update here.     "
24,"Woven Capital, Nvidia back Foretellix’s autonomous vehicle validation tech",['@rebeccabellan'],"May 2, 2023","Startups working on driverless cars fully may no longer attract the kind of nine-figure acquisition or funding offers that were prevalent just a few years ago. But there are still pockets within the broader automated vehicle technology sector that have captured the interest and investment of strategic investors. “We’re looking for solutions that can integrate into our own tool stack,” Betty Bryant, a principal at Woven Capital, Toyota’s growth fund, told TechCrunch. “So a company that can provide a menu of options or just provide a specific piece of the stack, instead of a full stack company,” which Bryant says is “not really an attractive model or solution for OEMs anymore.” One such company Woven has strategically invested in is Foretellix, an Israeli startup that gives other companies the tools to verify  autonomous vehicle technology at any level. This capability, says Bryant, is essential for safety validation so that companies can actually commercialize and scale everything from Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to Level 4 autonomous technology. (According to the Society of Automobile Engineers, Level 2 systems automate two primary functions — maintaining speed and distance on a highway and keeping the vehicle in lane — and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 4 systems mean the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions without human intervention.) Woven Capital, alongside Nvidia and Artofin VC, participated in the first closing of Foretellix’s $43 million Series C, which was led by 83North. Ziv Binyamini, CEO at Foretellix, said the company will use the funds to continue to invest in the deep technology needed to verify autonomy while hiring sales teams to help the company expand across more geographies. Foretellix already has around 150 employees spread across Israel, California, Detroit, Germany, Sweden, China and Japan. “We need to beef it up because demand is growing significantly,” Binyamini told TechCrunch. At a high level, Foretellix’s offerings can be boiled down to two core technologies: Scenario generation and big data analytics. Every company building autonomous vehicle technology tests their systems in simulation against various scenarios geared toward finding edge cases. Foretellix’s technology automatically generates “an unlimited number of variations of scenarios” that companies can use, according to Binyamini. “We also complement that core technology with libraries of what we call content,” he said. “Libraries of scenarios, libraries of KPIs. So if you’re developing ADAS, we have libraries for all the dysfunctions like automatic emergency braking, for example. For each such dysfunction, we also have a library of all the relevant scenarios and associated KPIs or metrics.” Once a company tests a system, either virtually against generated scenarios or physically on real roads, they then have to analyze the results, which is the second core technology Foretellix offers. Some of Foretellix’s biggest customers are Daimler Trucks and Volvo Group, both of which are building autonomous trucks. The company also works closely with Nvidia by integrating into its Drive SIM platform, Nvidia’s end-to-end simulation platform. Last September, Nvidia said Drive SIM got a new suite of AI tools to help test and develop self-driving vehicles. “Nvidia is an infrastructure provider for the whole economy, from the hardware to the software to the simulator to a full software stack,” said Binyamini. “Our solution is complementary to their offering because in the end, to build a full-blown autonomous system, you need to validate it. It’s one of the biggest, probably the biggest remaining challenge, to get autonomy to commercial, scalable deployment.” In a similar vein, Bryant said Woven by Toyota (formerly Woven Planet) is partnering with Foretellix because the startup’s solution complements Woven’s technology in-house. The mobility technology subsidiary is working on both ADAS and L4 technology, according to Bryant. “Foretellix has found an interesting niche area in the simulation space,” said Bryant. “Foretellix is not a simulation company, but it’s supporting simulation work. And I find that other players might be trying to work on building robust verification technology, but no one has quite the focus and depth of technology that Foretellix does.”"
25,Jeep is adding an even cheaper plug-in hybrid to its 4xe lineup,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 5, 2023","Jeep revealed Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show its 2024 Wrangler portfolio — a smorgasbord of off-roaders with new capabilities and features — and tucked into the mix is another plug-in hybrid. The Stellantis brand said it will add the 2024 Jeep Wrangler Sport S 4xe to its lineup, an entry-level plug-in hybrid that could help maintain its top PHEV sales spot. The Jeep 4xe — the branding given to its PHEVs — has been a hit in North America as enthusiasts and newcomers discover the benefits of being able to off road, or tool around town, in all-electric mode. The PHEVs are also part, but not all, of the parent company’s strategic plan to boost sales of electrified vehicles and cut its global footprint 50% by the end of the decade. Stellantis has said by the end of 2025, the entire North American Jeep brand lineup will be electrified. By 2030, 50% of Jeep brand sales in the United States will be battery-electric vehicles and 100% of Jeep vehicles in Europe will be fully electric. (Next year, the company will introduce two all-electric vehicles, the Jeep Recon and Wagoneer S.) A cheaper 4xe could help it get there. Jeep didn’t display the Sport S 4xe in New York. Instead, it showed off several other 2024 Wranglers, including the new 2024 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon pictured below and Willys variants. New 2024 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon X 4xe with available factory-installed 8,000-lb.-capacity Warn winch.

Image Credits: Jeep But Jeep did release some details about this cheaper variant. The 2024 Jeep Wrangler Sport S 4xe is the lightest in the lineup with a curb weight of 5,049 pounds. Like its 4xe siblings, the Sport S will be equipped with a 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine with an eTorque belt-start generator/motor and integrated transmission traction motor that produces 375 horsepower and 470-pound-feet of torque. The Sport S will have 21 miles of all-electric range and 49 MPGe. The vehicle will come with front and rear third-generation Dana axles with a gear ratio of 3.73 and the same high-pressure gas-charged monotube shock absorbers found in the Willys 4xe, Sahara 4xe, High Altitude 4xe. The Sport S 4xe, which comes standard with 20-inch aluminum wheels, will have 10.1-inch ground clearance and the ability to ford water up to 30 inches — the same as the Sahara and High Altitude trims. Image Credits: Jeep Image Credits: Jeep Inside there will be a 12.3-inch digital touchscreen, power windows and door locks, adaptive cruise control with stop, forward collision warning, side curtain airbags, remote keyless entry, premium soft-top, 20-inch aluminum wheels and Gorilla glass windshield. In all, Jeep will offer five 4xe trims: the Sport S, Willys, Sahara, Rubicon and High Altitude. While Jeep didn’t release any pricing information yet on any of the trims, the brand has said that the Sport S will be the entry-level 4xe option. In 2023, the cheapest 4xe was the Willys with a base price of $54,735. Jeep is also adding to its Wrangler portfolio in 2024 the Rubicon X, an elevated version of the Rubicon with standard 35-inch tires and either 2.0 or 3.6-liter automatic powertrains. The 2024 Jeep Wrangler will be available in Sport, Willys, Sahara, High Altitude, Rubicon and Rubicon 392 models. The company said that ordering is open now and vehicles will start to arrive in U.S. Jeep dealerships later in 2023."
26,DFC invests $25M in Novastar’s Africa People + Planet Fund,['@annienjanja'],"April 4, 2023","The U.S International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has made equity investment to the tune of $25 million in a new fund by Pan-African venture capital firm Novastar Ventures, to back founders building agriculture and climate solutions. The DFC revealed details of the transaction, and Novastar’s new investment vehicle, the Africa People + Planet Fund, during its latest update detailing the transactions it had approved over the last few months. TechCrunch could not establish the details of other limited partners that made commitments, however, sources familiar with the fund said that the Nairobi and Lagos-based VC firm targets to raise more than $200 million, making it one of the largest funds in the region. The Africa People + Planet Fund is Novastar’s third pool after the $108 million Africa Fund II, which saw it widen its geographical reach to include West Africa. The East Africa Fund — an $80 million fund with a $12.5 million co-investment facility — was its maiden kitty that invested in 15 startups within the region. Novastar’s two previous funds have financed tech-enabled startups serving the mass market in various sectors, including agriculture, education and off-grid renewable energy. TradeDepot, an e-commerce scaleup; Turaco, an insurtech; Moniepoint (formerly TeamApt), a fintech; mPharma, a health tech; MoKo, a furniture startup; and iProcure, an agtech, are among Novastar’s investees. “Going forward, we are looking to build on this experience and use the same tools and strategies to support sustainable, planet-positive, mass-market business models across Africa that the rest of the world can learn from,” Novastar co-founder and managing partner Andrew Carruthers told TechCrunch. The VC firm said, with the new fund, it will invest in climate techs, clean techs, marketplaces and initiatives that contribute to community resilience through the delivery of financial and supply chain services. “We see opportunities in all three categories, driven by the clear megatrends such as immense population growth, rapid urbanization and the vast amount of arable land on the continent,” said Carruthers. The target startups include marketplaces, financial and supply chain services that will “enable access-to-market and resilience in the face of climate change for the many.” The clean techs the VC firm plans to back include those dealing in clean utilities, clean construction technologies, electric mobility, smart logistics, the circular economy and alternative materials, that will “help decarbonize the growth that we will see on the continent in the next 10 to 20 years,” said Carruthers. Novastar will also back climate techs that use innovative business models “to deploy regenerative forestry, agriculture and aquaculture, biofuels, and biochar, that protect biodiversity, improves soil health and captures carbon,” while generating more opportunities for smallholder farming. The VC firm is availing more funding for clean techs in Africa, which were the second most funded startups in the region last year, after fintechs.    "
27,TikTok opens up its revamped creator fund to all eligible creators in the US,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 3, 2023","TikTok announced today that it’s opening its revamped creator fund, called the “Creativity Program Beta,” to all eligible creators in the United States. The company initially began testing the new program with select creators in February. TikTok says the new program is designed to generate higher revenue and unlock more real-world opportunities for creators. To be eligible for the program, creators must have a U.S.-based account, be at least 18 years of age and have at least 10,000 followers and at least 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Once enrolled in the new program, creators will not be able to revert back to the Creator Fund. TikTok did not say whether the Creativity Program will replace the Creator Fund altogether, but it’s possible that once the Creativity Program launches more widely and exits the beta phase, TikTok will scrap the Creator Fund. TikTok says the rewards formula for the Creativity Program Beta has been formulated to offer a higher average gross revenue for qualified video views, but did not provide any specifics about payments. The company’s current Creator Fund launched in 2020 with a $1 billion commitment over three years, but has been criticized by creators who have complained about low payouts, with some saying they earned a few dollars for videos that got millions of views. To start earning with the program, creators will need to create high-quality, original videos that are longer than one minute. For context, TikTok’s Creator Fund doesn’t require videos to be longer than one minute to be eligible for payment. The program gives creators access to an updated dashboard with more insights into estimated revenue, video performance metrics and analytics and video eligibility requirements. “The Creativity Program Beta is in its early stages, and we’re continuously exploring ways to improve the experience for our creator community and the way creators are rewarded,” TikTok wrote in a blog post. “We’re looking forward to hearing feedback from our community.” The Creativity Program is the latest addition to TikTok’s suite of monetization tools, which includes LIVE subscriptions and TikTok Pulse. The company also has tips and gifts monetization features. The new program isn’t the only recent launch from TikTok that has the aim of appeasing creators. In March, TikTok introduced a new feature called “Series” that allows eligible creators to post content behind a paywall. Series enables eligible creators to post collections of premium content behind a paywall that viewers can purchase for access. One Series can include up to 80 videos, each up to 20 minutes long. Creators can select the price for their Series that they believe best reflects the value of their exclusive content. Series is currently only available to select creators, with applications to join opening in the coming months.  "
28,"Talking with Future Ventures about its new fund, AI hype and Siri sucking (still)",['@cookie'],"April 12, 2023","For a firm whose bets are largely unpredictable, the early-stage venture firm Future Ventures has become very formulaic in its fundraising. Now entering its fifth year, the firm just closed a $200 million fund — its third in a row. In fact, it would have exactly $600 million under management at this point if not for special purpose vehicles — pop-up funds, essentially — that it has raised to plow more money into some of its more capital-intensive companies and that bring the firm’s assets under management to $925 million. As we highlighted when the outfit closed its second fund in 2021, the team could raise far more if it wanted. Co-founder Steve Jurvetson is a veteran VC who has long been close to Elon Musk, spending more than 14 years on the board of Tesla before stepping off in the fall of 2020, holding a seat on the board of SpaceX for the past 14-plus years and investing in Musk’s tunneling concern, The Boring Company. With Future Ventures co-founder Maryanna Saenko, the pair also wrote the first check to Musk’s neurotechnology startup, Neuralink, while Saenko, a robotics expert with degrees from Carnegie Mellon, has driven investments in a wide number of similarly ambitious companies, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which is aiming to build a compact fusion power plant; 64x Bio, a gene therapy manufacturing company that raised $55 million last year; and Gameto, a reproductive health company that wants to make egg freezing as routine as a tooth cleaning — and nearly as affordable. Given their track record — Jurvetson was also an early investor in the now public satellite data company Planet Labs — the obvious question is why they keep raising the same, conservative amount for each fund, and the answer, suggests Saenko, boils down to strategy. For one thing, Future Ventures has and remains focused exclusively on seed- and early-stage companies, writing initial checks of between $3 and $6 million, she says. In other words, it doesn’t need a lot of money considering what it’s putting to work. It also helps that the firm — by its own telling — dives into startups where there isn’t a lot of competition from rival outfits at the outset, either because it’s a little “out there” or the time commitment is longer than most VCs can tolerate. One such bet is The Better Meat Co. In a call earlier today with Saenko and Jurvetson, they raved about the five-year-old company, which has raised just $10 million to date, according to Crunchbase data, but that has enormous potential, in their view. “This is an alternative-protein-future-of-meat company [centered on a] type of fungus that grows more quickly than any other life form that you might consider as meat,” Jurvetson explained. “It goes from zero to harvest in 18 hours.” Better Meat’s product, which has a meat-like texture and flavor profile, is sold as a meat-like product to other businesses at a cheaper cost than chicken or beef, says Jurvetson. But even better, he says, the “actual organism that they have patented for this production process has been part of the human diet for thousands of years in other products” so falls into a category of being “generally regarded as safe” by the FDA, meaning that it can go — and has — straight to market. (Many other plant-based alternatives to meat and seafood face a more complicated regulatory path.) Another signature bet is ZaiNar, which  leverages digital signal processing techniques to locate radio devices in 3D with what it says is meter-level accuracy. Think phones indoors and in dense cities; vehicles without a line of sight; and assets that use IoT devices in industrial environments. Future Ventures has even bet on birth control for men, funding Your Choice Therapeutics last summer. Naturally, we wondered what Saenko and Jurvetson think about the most futuristic-seeming trend of all right now: the dramatic advancements in AI that have the world so captivated. Were they as surprised as the rest of world by what ChatGPT released into the wild? Notably, when we asked them on the phone earlier today, both sounded a bit dubious. “I think what I’ve been surprised by has been the public sentiment, offered Saenko. “The pace of AI innovation and its capacity to solve increasingly interesting problems in a compelling way — we’ve been marching to that drumbeat for quite a while now. And so it’s interesting to me that [ChatGPT’s release] in the broader social sphere was such a compelling inflection point that suddenly all of these people who frankly didn’t care at all about the space now can’t stop talking about it.” Added Jurvetson, “It’s funny. My next meeting is with [our portfolio] company called MosaicML; Naveen [Rao] was formerly a founder in Nervana [a deep learning startup that sold to Intel for more than $400 million in 2016]. Now he offers these foundational models for everyone else. It’s kind of like democratizing access. So imagine you can build ChatGPT for under $500,000, which is still a big number, but it’s not $10 billion or $1 billion dollars depending on whose numbers you believe. It’s a much more interesting, scalable business proposition [because] basically they figured out a way to make this work more cheaply.” He’s not bearish — quite the contrary, he’d said, but he also observed that people adapt to the future quite fast. “We should expect more and more examples like this, where they feel like magic, you give it a couple of years, and then it sort of fits into the fabric of society.” With one glaring exception. Given that Jurvetson cut his teeth at Apple decades ago in a marketing role, we couldn’t help but ask why its voice assistant Siri is still so aggravatingly bad at so much, even with the phenomenal advancements happening all around it in the world of AI. Jurvetson called it “a hairball of code that was marketed as a great breakthrough but really wasn’t a very scalable architecture. And [Apple has] been stuck with that.” Saenko had a more generous take on why Siri still can’t get some of the simplest things quite right. “Siri fails in very knowable ways,” said Saenko. Alluding to the strange behavior of Microsoft’s Bing chatbot at its rollout, she added that it “isn’t going to randomly start yelling at you or putting random events on your calendar or sending emails on your behalf that you didn’t intend. “One could could make the argument that the [large language model] systems as they currently exist today have too much capacity to go haywire if you give them too much power. Maybe that’s what Apple has indexed on, because if you think about it, the products they put out in the world are really pretty fully baked.”"
29,10 years of fintech failure: 3 more ideas that failed to live up to the initial hype,['@Eastertweet'],"April 24, 2023","This article follows a piece I wrote that looked at six fintech ideas from the first decade of fintech that failed to go mainstream — algorithm-based buy/sell/hold advice, trade mimicking, P2P lending, P2P insurance, on-demand insurance and standalone financial planning apps. But there’s more to the story. Given the intense interest in the fintech sector, it’s worth examining three more concepts that initially seemed promising but largely failed to change the financial services industry. Before diving in, it is important to once again first define how we are categorizing “failure.” This article is not focused on highlighting the demise of individual high-profile fintech startups or various failed fintech initiatives undertaken by large corporations (such as BloombergBlack or UBS’ SmarthWealth). These ideas rolled out with hype and momentum, but they ultimately failed to change the way the average person manages their money.

Rather, this piece will focus on fintech ideas that received some degree of initial hype and momentum but ultimately failed to change the way the average person manages their money. So, with those caveats, here are three more fintech concepts from the last 10 years of fintech that did not succeed. In the early 2010s, approximately 15 firms launched an online search or matchmaking service designed to help individuals find a financial adviser that best met their needs. The traditional approach to financial advice — where wealthy individuals usually find an adviser through friends, family or a local financial adviser’s proactive sales outreach — lags behind modern online product search trends. Every day, consumers shop online and pour over user reviews. The logic behind this early wave of startups was that the experience of finding a financial adviser should mimic the way consumers look for other products and services online. Financial adviser matchmaking startups generally took one of two approaches. The first approach was to offer a search tool that let users find local financial advisers based on parameters such as assets under management, experience, rating, gender, etc. Here’s an example of a financial adviser’s profile on the now-defunct financial adviser search tool Tippybob. 2013 screenshot of a financial adviser profile at Tippybob. Image: Grant Easterbrook 2013 screenshot of a financial adviser profile at Tippybob. Image: Grant Easterbrook The second approach was to offer an online financial adviser matchmaking service. Prospects were asked to enter basic information about their income, age, assets, needs, etc. and the firm would introduce them to a local financial adviser who was selected as a personalized fit for their needs. As of 2023, there are still a few independent sites (such as SmartAsset and Zoe Financial) offering some kind of financial adviser matchmaking tool. And of course, Googling “financial advisers in my area” will yield paid ad placements. In general, however, independent financial adviser search and matchmaking tools failed to go mainstream. Most wealthy individuals still find their financial adviser via traditional methods rather than relying on web-based approaches. This idea failed to catch on for two reasons. First, these startups were unable to overcome the difficulty of building a two-sided network for a product with a slow sales cycle. Advisers didn’t want to join these matchmaking services unless there’s a large number of users on the platform. Without a significant number of advisers on the platform, however, these services struggled to attract users. This chicken-or-the-egg problem was compounded by the very slow sales cycle of financial advice. Secondly, financial advice is fundamentally different from other types of goods and services sold online. There are potentially massive negative consequences if a consumer chooses the wrong financial adviser and they receive bad investment advice. Ordering a pizza or a pair of shoes online does not carry the same level of risk. Consumers who would like to work with a financial adviser seem inclined to only want to hire someone with whom they have a high level of personal trust. Thus, the financial adviser business model has proven resilient to disruption by online product search and comparison services that have upended so many other industries."
30,Parloa raises $21M to add a little automation to contact centers,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 30, 2023","It’s estimated that over $400 billion are spent annually to run customer contact centers around the world. To cut costs, in recent years, contact centers have embraced AI and automation; research from The Harris Poll indicates that 46% of customer interactions were already automated as of 2021. That’s good news for the vendors selling contact center automation software. VCs believe that to be the case, certainly, judging by recent investment upswing. Startups including Invoca, Replicant, PolyAI and Observe.ai have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from backers over the past year alone, reflecting the bullish views of labor-saving customer service tech. Another winner in the contact center automation boom is Parloa, a German-based enterprise software provider that uses a combination of conversational AI tech and low-code tools to help companies lighten the load on their contact center employees (or so the sales pitch goes). Parloa today announced that it raised €20 million (~$21.67 million) in a Series A funding round led by EQT Ventures, with participation from Newion and Senovo. The fresh cash, which brings Parloa’s total raised to €25 million (~$27.09 million), will be put toward customer acquisition efforts, opening a U.S. office and product R&D. “AI is waiting in the wings right now to disrupt the multi-billion customer service market for good,” co-founder and CEO Malte Kosub told TechCrunch in an email interview. “The status quo in customer service is the same across Europe, Middle East, and Africa and the U.S.: not a good customer experience. So also the speed of the AI adoption in customer service will be the same in those areas.” Parloa began as an internal effort at Future of Voice, a conversational AI agency that Kosub co-launched with Stefan Ostwald in 2017. Kosub and Ostwald built a low-code tool for developing “multi-channel voice experiences” (e.g. Alexa skills, phone bots) for Future of Voice’s clients, which they code-named Parloa. In 2020, Kosub and Ostwald sold Future of Voice and recruited the employees that had been working on Parloa to help scale the software independently. Parloa offers a patchwork of apps and services that, when meshed together via low-code drag-and-drop dashboards, can power contact center automation flows. For instance, Parloa’s speech-to-text module — driven by Microsoft Cognitive Services, Microsoft’s set of API-based AI services — can be combined with Parloa’s natural language understanding models to create a phone dialogue tree. Or Parloa’s integrations with third-party text-generating models, including OpenAI’s recently released GPT-4, could be connected with the aforementioned speech-to-text module to answer commonly-asked customer questions and complaints. Parloa connects various modules and services to help automate contact centers. Image Credits: Parloa Parloa connects various modules and services to help automate contact centers. Image Credits: Parloa To put it in more concrete terms, a typical company might use Parloa’s tools to create a phone-answering bot that can automatically figure out what a customer’s calling about (e.g. changing their billing address) and respond to their questions in natural language. Or it might use Parloa’s translation tools to let its customer service agents speak with customers in multiple languages. Parloa’s approach isn’t exactly novel — lots of contact center platforms offer the same type of setup — but the startup claims that its platform is superior in some ways from a technical standpoint. For instance, Parloa claims its AI tools, apps and modules can reduce spelling errors and other “unwanted conversational patterns” during calls and continue listening during natural pauses in conversations. “The pandemic was a particular driver for the increased demands on digital customer service, which we as Parloa are helping to automate,” Kosub said. “Customer service is as old as business itself. So we are not inventing a new market environment or focusing on small sub-segments, but helping an established multi-billion market with innovative technology.” Kosub wouldn’t say exactly how many customers Parloa currently has, save a few big names like Decathlon and German Red Cross. When asked about macroeconomic headwinds like the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, he countered with a stat he argues illustrates one of the reasons the contact center automation market will continue to grow: 71% of agents thought about leaving their job in the past six months, according to a Salesforce study. “Companies have to deal with a decreasing availability of agents, staff shortages of agents and job unattractiveness — much of an agent’s time is spent on repetitive tasks, like authentication, that could be done by AI,” Kosub said. One might argue that agent turnover is better avoided with higher wages and better benefits as opposed to automation. Among the common complaints from workers in the industry are high production demands and a lack of training; in 2021, call center workers at healthcare giant Cigna went so far as to circulate a petition calling for better working conditions. Investments in automation are an easier sell, of course — particularly in a down economy. Parloa’s biggest challenge likely won’t be finding new customers, but standing out in a crowded field. Kosub says he’s up to it, fortunately. “We weren’t affected by the slowdown or the pandemic at all. Customer service demand is growing and the pressure to be more efficient is increasing as well,” he said. “Corporate-wise, we grew from 30 employees during our seed funding to more than 100 in less than 12 months, with new joiners from Google, Salesforce, SAP, TeamViewer and Celonis.”"
31,Y Combinator-backed Luca aims to optimize retail prices at enterprise scale,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 27, 2023","Luca, a startup building price planning and prediction tools for retailers, today announced that it closed a $2.5 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Y Combinator (Luca was in Y Combinator’s winter 2023 class), Soma Capital and angel investors. Luca was co-founded by Tanvi Surti and Yonah Mann, who worked together on Uber’s dynamic pricing team. Mann was focused on Uber Eats pricing, while Surti led the UberPool pricing group. “During my time on the Pool team in 2019, the business had bad unit economics,” Surti told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Uber was on the verge of an IPO, and I was responsible for getting the unit economics working by reconfiguring Uber Pool’s pricing algorithm. In ten months, we succeeded in plugging a massive hole in Uber’s profit and loss using pricing tech. That got us thinking.” Surti describes Luca as a “pricing co-pilot for enterprise retailers.” In plain English, it’s a platform that taps AI to identify revenue and margin headroom, make recommendations for price adjustments and measure the outcomes. “Pricing strategy is one of the most powerful levers that retailers have to create margin and revenue growth, yet most retail pricing teams are often shooting in the dark,” Surti said. “Retail pricing teams have to incorporate large volumes of data from multiple channels to build a strategy — sales history, market trends, competitor price changes and inventory availability. They have to do this across tens of thousands of SKUs and multiple stakeholders.” The need — and the massive addressable market — sowed the seeds for a number of pricing optimization and planning startups. Pricefx, one of the more successful vendors, has raised tens of millions for its algorithmic pricing software designed for software-as-a-service businesses. Fetcherr, which focuses on pricing adjustment for the airline industry, recently landed a $12.5 million equity investment. Luca’s platform attempts to optimize retail prices using historical data and other signals. Image Credits: Luca Luca’s platform attempts to optimize retail prices using historical data and other signals. Image Credits: Luca Luca’s differentiation, ostensibly, lies in its pricing engine, which takes in retailers’ historical sales and inventory data as well as competitor signals to forecast the sales performance of products at different price points. Once its pricing recommendations are approved, Luca keeps tabs on sales volume, looking out for undesirable trends. “Unlike some other players in this space, we are not a dynamic pricing company. We just don’t think that’s the right user experience for retail — yet,” Surti said. “Our solution is complementary to the human decision maker and our goal is to provide humans with decision making superpowers by turning a sea of data into clear recommendations, with high levels of explainability.” It’s early days for Luca in terms of customer acquisition — the startup’s only worked with eight brands so far. But Surti claims that two brands that have shown interest are Fortune 500 retailers. “Post pandemic, most retailers are feeling growth and margin pressures due to higher customer acquisition costs, reduced consumer spending and rising interest rates,” Surti said. “Most retail software-as-a-service tooling out there rarely directly impacts business metrics, whereas retail executives we’ve interviewed are actively looking for revenue optimization opportunities … That’s where we come in – our solution creates direct and measurable business value.” The seed funding will be put toward expanding Luca’s engineering and data science teams, he added."
32,Today’s cost-conscious business climate could give RPA a boost,"['Alex Wilhelm', 'Anna Heim']","March 24, 2023","As tech companies large and small shed staff in hopes of better aligning their income statements to a new market reality, it’s clear that cutting costs to delight investors is the new norm. But there are other ways to make the investing public happy, including smashing growth and profitability expectations. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. That’s what UiPath did last week when it reported its trailing financial performance, which included a top- and bottom-line beat compared to analyst expectations. Its shares soared. It turns out that while slashing staff, curtailing projects and treating cash with more respect is fashionable among tech companies and many of their customers today, there’s a wrinkle in the trend. One way to make your staffing cheaper is to reduce it. Another is to make it more productive, making your spend more effective on a per-dollar basis. That’s where UiPath and the larger automation market — robotic process automation, or RPA — may have an edge on other software categories. Last month’s positive earnings report from Appian and the lengthy discussions of its automation work during its earnings call underscored that tech companies see strong demand for automation help. There’s even more data on the point we’ve been chewing on. A recent report on software spend from Battery Ventures that we previously discussed contains even more bullish data. In short, sure, everyone wants to save a buck on their software spend. But if your startup is building tech to automate tasks and drive quick productivity gains, you might be able to duck the downturn. Let’s talk about it. "
33,Oxenfree II: Lost Signals will launch on Netflix and other platforms on July 12,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 19, 2023","Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, the follow-up to the supernatural thriller Oxenfree, will launch on July 12 on mobile, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Steam. The game was developed by Night School Studio, a gaming studio that Netflix acquired back in 2021. Night School Studio originally planned to launch Oxenfree II: Lost Signals in 2022 but delayed the release date to 2023. “Set five years after the events of the first game, which continues to be celebrated for its compelling storytelling, relatable characters and captivating art style, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals will take players on a gripping narrative-driven adventure featuring an all-new cast of characters and original story,” Netflix teased in a press release. The game follows the story of Riley Poverly, an environmental researcher who returns to her hometown Camena to investigate unnaturally occurring radio frequency signals causing disturbances in electronic equipment. At launch, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals will feature localized interface and subtitle support for Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. Nigh School Studio was the first gaming studio that Netflix acquired. Since then, the streaming giant has acquired several other studios, including Spry Fox, Next Games and Boss Fight Entertainment. Netflix also opened a new gaming studio in Southern California and established an internal games studio based in Helsinki, Finland, led by the co-founder and general manager of the Zynga Helsinki game development studio, Marko Lastikka. Today’s announcement comes as Netflix recently revealed that it has 40 games slated for launch this year and has 70 in development with its partners. The streaming service also has 16 games currently being developed by its in-house game studios. Netflix launched games in November 2021 and has released 55 titles since then. Netflix VP of External Games Leanne Loombe told reporters during a briefing last month that the company is primarily focused on mobile but that it’s working on its own cloud streaming technology, as was revealed by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu at TechCrunch Disrupt last October.

34,How you invest your time is just as important as how you invest your money,[],"April 2, 2023","Editor’s note: The following is an excerpt from the author’s book, “Breaking into Venture.” One night, a policeman is doing his typical evening neighborhood walk. The sun has set, and he’s on high alert for any potential danger as he strolls slowly down the street. Soon, he comes across a professionally dressed man frantically pacing beneath a streetlight, periodically dropping to his knees to look between the cracks of the sidewalk. He is desperately offering $100 to any passerby who can help him find his misplaced keys. Relieved at the sight of law enforcement, he asks for the policeman’s help and explains that he urgently needs to get home to his family. Together, they search every inch of the sidewalk, the gutter, and the road beneath the light and come up empty. Anyone they have enlisted for help similarly gives up after finding nothing beneath the streetlight. Frustrated and disappointed, the policeman finally asks, “Well, sir, are you sure you lost them here? Is there anywhere else they could be?” The man replies, “Well, no, I actually lost them in the park across the street, but the light is better over here.” This tale encapsulates a concept commonly known as the streetlight effect. Its origins can be traced back to a Turkish parable from the thirteenth century, but the concept has been repeated throughout history in everything from jokes about people who lost their keys to scientific explanations of observer bias in which observers only see what they expect to see. The point is that you can spend a lot of time searching for something, but if you’re looking in the wrong places, you’ll never find it. Unfortunately, in my early days of venture capital, nobody told me this story, so I immediately started searching for deal flow where it was easiest: in Hong Kong. I had a strong personal network and brand in the Hong Kong region, and I had no trouble finding local entrepreneurs who wanted to pitch Fresco Capital for funding. I spent my days meeting with new companies that were willing to come to my favorite coffee shop on Hollywood Road in Hong Kong, though they were not the businesses I was most excited about or thought were most likely to go on to be massively successful. Soon, I found myself with an extremely packed schedule but little excitement about any prospective investments. At the end of every week, I would sit back and wonder where the time went. I was growing self-conscious that I had nothing to show for my packed schedule.
You can spend a lot of time searching for something, but if you’re looking in the wrong places, you’ll never find it. I had been investing my time in meeting with local entrepreneurs, a strategy that wasn’t producing results. Clearly there was a light shining directly in front of me in Hong Kong, but I had a feeling my keys were across the street in a park somewhere. I knew I had to stop doing what was easy and start looking beyond Hong Kong for deal flow. Along with my business partner, I began to spend my time researching the major hubs of entrepreneurial and tech activity that had a high concentration of entrepreneurs seeking funding. I also hunted for those who had produced big outcomes in the past decade (unlike Hong Kong, which was still early in its journey as a startup ecosystem and did not have as many examples of successful venture-backed businesses). Then I hit the road. My partner and I spent time in cities like San Francisco, Austin, and New York, as well as London, Beijing, and Singapore. I spent the better part of my first five years in venture capital on a plane (mostly in middle seats in economy, to be exact). On each trip, I was energized by the entrepreneurial buzz in each region we visited and overwhelmed by the number of promising companies we met in each place. My days were equally jam packed, if not more so, than my time at home. However, unlike my experience in Hong Kong, each day of meetings was yielding exciting investment opportunities that I was eager to dig into. Time flew by, and I was finally producing results. I had real deal flow! I just had to get on a plane to go get it. As a new, small fund, we were on a shoestring budget, so I crashed on friends’ couches or stayed in inexpensive Airbnbs while I was traveling. Especially when it came to navigating the San Francisco Bay Area, I could not have felt more like an outsider. Who knew that Google’s headquarters in Mountain View were at least an hour from downtown San Francisco, and that distance ballooned into several hours during rush hour, which in California started not at 5 p.m. like a person might usually expect, but instead at 3 or 4 p.m.? One trip, in hopes of cutting down on travel times, I picked the halfway point between my meetings and splurged on a budget motel in Daly City. I arrived, suitcase in hand, only to discover that the hotel was located directly across the street from a junkyard filled exclusively with old school desks, and that Daly City was affectionately referred to by locals as “Daly Shitty.” It certainly wasn’t exactly what I had originally envisioned happening once I was on the other side of the investing table, but it was fun and energizing to be hunting for opportunities, trying to find the diamond in the rough or the next big thing. We were simultaneously in the process of raising our fund, so when we did make an investment, it was a very small amount. We were, however, investing a lot of our time in developing new sources of deal flow."

36,Global PC shipments dropped by a third in Q1,['@bheater'],"April 10, 2023","After a nice spike during the first two years of the pandemic, global PC shipments continued to drop for a fourth consecutive quarter. Analyst firm IDC’s latest figure has Q1 down 29% from the same time last year. Canalys paints an even more troubling picture for the industry, with a full 33% drop. A disappointing 2022 holiday set the stage for the beginning of the year, as vendor inventory has continued to pile up — a trend that is expected to carry at least into Q3. The plunge has been so consistent that last quarter’s figures dipped below those of Q1 2019, putting worldwide shipments below their pre-pandemic level. “Though channel inventory has depleted in the last few months, it’s still well above the healthy four to six week range,” says IDC’s Jitesh Ubrani. “Even with heavy discounting, channels and PC makers can expect elevated inventory to persist into the middle of the year and potentially into the third quarter.” Image Credits: Canalys Image Credits: Canalys The culprits? For starters, a lot of people purchased new systems in 2020 and 2021 as their work settings adapted to a global pandemic. Laptops tend to have a life span of around three to five years. Desktops are even longer, at three to eight. People are likely to be content with their systems for a few years at least. Assuming there’s a ceiling on PC sales, it’s simply not possible for the industry to maintain constant growth. You can, naturally, add ongoing economic troubles to the list. When things look bad, people tend to hold off on purchasing big-ticket items. Laptops (a category that excludes tablets) were the worst hit, marking a 34% Y-o-Y drop, per Canalys. Desktops suffered too — but fared slightly better, with a 28% decline. As vendors go, both IDC and Canalys have Apple suffering the largest drop, at 40.5 and 45.5%, respectively. That’s a staggering figure, likely owing — at least in part — to the company coming back down to earth, as the M1 chip managed to buck larger category trends in 2021/2022. That chip marked Apple’s biggest PC computing update since the company shifted to Intel decades prior. In spite of what ad copy might suggest, you don’t get a generational shift every year. Image Credits: IDC Image Credits: IDC Apple nabs fourth place on both lists, with Lenovo, HP and Dell coming in at first, second and third, respectively, while Asus rounds out the top five. Each manufacturer suffered, however, with figures ranging from HP’s 24.1% drop to Asus’s 38.8% (per Canalys). Both firms see reason for cautious optimism heading into the end of the year and early next. “By 2024, an aging installed base will start coming up for refresh,” says IDC’s Linn Huang. “If the economy is trending upwards by then, we expect significant market upside as consumers look to refresh, schools seek to replace worn down Chromebooks, and businesses move to Windows 11. If recession in key markets drags on into next year, recovery could be a slog.”"
37,The tide has shifted for solo GPs,['@nmasc_'],"March 25, 2023","Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host Natasha Mascarenhas. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. It’s hard to be proactive after the tide has already shifted. However, that’s what we’re seeing happen in the solo GP world, where investors, hearing about institutional investor risk appetite changing, are extending fundraising timelines, cutting investment vehicle targets or planning to leave venture altogether. Some have learned it the hard way, while others, like Sahil Lavingia, are telling LPs to literally cancel their checks if they feel guilty about investing in venture capital while the market rocks and interest rates boom. It’s a shift from the fund of fund mentality that felt commonplace last year, in which investment firms cut checks to early-stage, experimental investors to de-risk and even lead first checks into a generation of new startups. Now, the idea of backing just one, feels like a harder sell — depending on which institution you’re speaking to. For my full take on this burgeoning tension within the venture world read my TC+ column: “Are solo GPs screwed?” I know some of us are still reeling from the SVB mess, which is still very much unfolding. My hope with this piece is to offer nuance on how the market moves on from here for a very specific subset of check writers.

It’s a safety thing — effectively a way of ensuring that robots don’t accidentally hurt people. They’re big, fast and made of metal. We’re small, squishy and don’t always look where we should. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s the best we’ve had for a long time. As automation increases in these spaces, so, too, will the opportunity for injury. These sorts of safety concerns lie at the heart of Veo Robotics’ founding principles. Simply put, the Massachusetts-based firm builds software solutions designed to help humans and robots coexist in a working space.

The total includes $15 million raised last year — though the firm opted to hold off on making the raise public until securing $14 million in 2023. Safar Partners and Yamaha Motor Ventures participated in the round, following past investments from big names like Google Ventures and Baidu Ventures. The most notable name this time out, however is Amazon. The retail behemoth participated by way of the $1 billion Industrial Innovation Fund it announced almost exactly a year ago. Robotics have been a key focus for the fund since the first wave of investments, which featured Agility Robotics, BionicHIVE and Mantis Robotics.   Amazon has been amassing its own in-house robot army since its 2012 acquisition of Kiva Systems. It’s easy to view these investments as a kind of trial run for potential acquisitions, though the company has largely denied that it uses the money as an on-boarding process. That said, it is certainly a vote of confidence and, at the very least, probably an indication that the company will begin piloting this technology in its own workspaces — assuming it hasn’t already. Veo says the fresh funding will go toward accelerating its work with “corporate partners.” “The newest generation of intelligent robotic systems work with people, not separately from them,” says co-founder and CTO Clara Vu. “Unlocking this potential requires a new generation of safety systems — this is Veo’s mission, and we’re very excited to be taking this next step.” Amazon’s systems have traditionally been enclosed. The Kiva robots, for instance, work in a confined area that requires space safety equipment for a human to enter, while its robotic arms operate in their own cells. More recently, however, the company has began branching out in systems like the autonomous Proteus, which allow for closer human-robot interaction. “As investors, we were drawn to Veo Robotics’ focus on safety in the workplace,” says Industrial Innovation Fund director, Matt Peterson. “Their technology is both collaborative and effective, prioritizing employee well-being. We are excited to support Veo Robotics and their vision to design innovative and human-centric robotics.”"
40,TikTok CEO says it wasn’t ‘spying’ when ByteDance employees surveilled journalists,['@tayhatmaker'],"March 23, 2023","At Thursday’s House hearing, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew faced a barrage of questions over concerns that data collected on U.S. users might be vulnerable to surveillance by China. Chew’s response to one of those questions in particular likely dug the company’s hole even deeper when it comes to building trust with Washington. Citing reporting from Forbes, later confirmed by the company itself, Florida Rep. Neal Dunn asked Chew if TikTok parent company ByteDance has spied on American citizens. Chew responded “I don’t think that spying is the right way to describe it.” .@DrNealDunnFL2: ""Has ByteDance spied on American citizens?"" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew: ""I don't think that spying is the right way to describe it."" pic.twitter.com/23nvsd7bEG — CSPAN (@cspan) March 23, 2023  In December, TikTok admitted that ByteDance employees used the app to track the location of journalists reporting critically on the company through their IP addresses. Four ByteDance employees, both U.S. and China-based, were fired for accessing the data in an apparent effort to identify sources leaking internal company information to reporters. “The public trust that we have spent huge efforts building is going to be significantly undermined by the misconduct of a few individuals,” ByteDance’s chief executive Liang Rubo said in an internal email published by Emily Baker-White, one of the surveilled reporters. “I believe this situation will serve as a lesson to us all.” The short exchange is likely to be one moment among many that further undermines trust in TikTok in spite of the company’s sweeping campaign to portray itself as transparent and accountable. That effort, known as Project Texas, is a massive $1.5 billion corporate reorganization that will ultimately move U.S. user data to domestic servers overseen by American software giant Oracle by the end of the year. TikTok is also waging a parallel public relations campaign, recruiting influencers, courting journalists and spreading its message through its own app in the run up to Thursday’s hearing. Whether those measures will have any impact on TikTok’s strained relationship with the U.S. government remains to be seen, but it doesn’t look likely. Now, with the FBI and DOJ reportedly investigating the incident of ByteDance surveilling American journalists, the company is in for an even steeper climb to improve its image. "

42,Fixie wants to make it easier for companies to build on top of language models,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 30, 2023","Yet another startup hoping to cash in on the generative AI craze has secured an eye-popping tranche of VC funding. Called Fixie, the firm, founded by former engineering heads at Apple and Google, aims to connect text-generating models similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT to an enterprise’s data, systems and workflows. Co-founder and CEO Matt Welsh describes it as the first enterprise-focused platform-as-a-service for building experiences with large language models (LLMs). “Essentially, Fixie is an infinitely extensible model that enterprises can integrate into their own products and tools,” co-founder and CPO Zach Koch told TechCrunch in an email interview. “The core of Fixie is its LLM-powered agents that can be built by anyone and run anywhere.” Whether Fixie is the first of its kind is slightly in question, but what isn’t is the founding team’s pedigree. Welsh was an engineering leader on the Chrome team at Google for nearly a decade before coming to Fixie. Koch was a product director at Shopify and a lead on the Chrome and Android teams. CTO Justin Uberti was one of the original architects of AOL Instant Messenger. As for Fixie’s chief AI officer, Hessam Bagherinezhad, he was a machine learning exec at Apple on products including the iPhone and Apple Watch. Here’s the ten-thousand-foot view of Fixie platform’s: LLM-powered agents that interface with external systems. Fixie agents can interact with databases, APIs (e.g. GitHub’s), productivity tools (e.g. Google Calendar) and public data sources (e.g. web search engines and social media) to generate and process arbitrary things, like images and text, and then manipulate them in various ways. With Fixie, a company could, for example, incorporate language model capabilities into their customer support workflows by building agents that take in a customer ticket as input, automatically look up a customer’s purchases, issue a refund if necessary and generate a draft reply to the ticket. Fixie agents can be implemented in any programming language and hosted on any infrastructure, and each agent can use its own custom-tailored LLM. Fixie supports popular models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 out of the box, but customers can provide their own models or tap other commercial and open models if they choose. “Ultimately, we believe that LLMs replace a lot of conventional software, since these models can act as a natural-language-powered ‘problem solving engine,'” Welsh said. “Rather than writing a bunch of gnarly code to interface two systems together, with Fixie, it is a simple matter of wrapping each system in a natural language agent interface and getting those systems to communicate with each other in English. The LLM itself acts as an incredibly powerful symbolic manipulator, requiring no programming to parse, manipulate, and synthesize data. Natural language can act as a lingua franca for diverse computing systems to talk to each other.” It’s a compelling vision, to be sure — and one that OpenAI embraced recently with the launch of plugins for ChatGPT. In a piece this week, media analyst Ben Thompson wrote about how plugins make ChatGPT more of an aggregator or platform rather than simply a chat interface — similar to how Welsh describes Fixie and its family of agents. ChatGPT plugins could represent somewhat of an existential threat to Fixie, in fact. But Welsh argues that the Fixie platform offers far more customizability — and freedom — than OpenAI’s take, at least at present. With Fixie, companies can connect various apps and services together through pretrained or custom language models. Image Credits: Fixie With Fixie, companies can connect various apps and services together through pretrained or custom language models. Image Credits: Fixie “New ChatGPT plugins provide a great way to connect OpenAI’s LLM with external APIs. But our focus with Fixie is different,” he said. “Because Fixie is model- and provider-agnostic, enterprises can leverage LLMs of any kind and host agents on their own infrastructure … Fixie handles the underlying LLM interactions as well as details such as user identity, authentication, session management, storage and configuration.” Welsh sees another rival in Zapier’s Natural Language Actions feature, which lets developers use natural language to move info between apps, products and services. But he doesn’t consider it to be directly competitive, noting that Fixie doesn’t train its own LLMs from scratch but rather enables customers to fine-tune existing LLMs for their agents using either proprietary data or historical data flowing through a given agent. Indeed, Welsh makes the case that Fixie goes several steps beyond what’s out there by addressing some of the major hurdles in adopting generative AI, namely the high cost of training LLMs and the risks associated with even the best models available today. Fixie allows companies to fine-tune rather than train models themselves, eliminating a cost expenditure, he asserts, and constrains the actions of models to ensure they more reliably perform tasks and answer questions. Welsh wasn’t hyperbolic to the point that he promised Fixie can completely fix (forgive the wordplay) LLMs’ tendency to make up facts, a problematic phenomenon known as hallucination. (Fixie won’t solve their other problems either, like biases and short memories.) He also conceded that fine-tuning alternatives to the Fixie platform exist, like the open source LangChain and Llama Index. But Welsh stressed that Fixie is designed for users with a range of expertise — in theory lowering the barrier to entry for deploying generative AI. To wit, Fixie has around 5,000 users in an early access program and says it’s working with “a wide range” of companies on use cases like business automation, customer support, generative AI and graphics. It’ll launch publicly in the coming days, free for personal use, backed by a $17 million investment ($12 million in seed funding, $5 million in pre-seed funding) from Redpoint Ventures, Madrona, Zetta Venture Partners, SignalFire, Bloomberg Beta and Kearny Jackson. That Fixie found funding easily — and quickly, within the span of the past half year — isn’t surprising, exactly. According to a PitchBook report released this month, VCs have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Angel and seed deals have grown, as well, with 107 deals and $358.3 million invested in 2022 compared with just 41 and $102.8 million in 2018. Assuming all goes well, Welsh says Fixie plans to grow its eight-person team to 20 by the end of the year. Before then, it’ll focus mainly on customer acquisition. “LLMs enable radically new capabilities for software systems of all kinds, but businesses haven’t yet been able to take full advantage of these advancements,” Welsh said. “Everyone has seen the tremendous power of things like ChatGPT, and there is widespread recognition of the huge impact this technology will have on the entire information technology industry. The question is how to best tap into this technology and integrate it with existing and new systems in a way that is secure, scalable, and easy to deploy and manage. That’s where Fixie comes in.”"
43,"Ransomware attack forces Dallas to shut down courts, disrupts some 911 services",['@carlypage_'],"May 4, 2023","The City of Dallas in Texas has confirmed a ransomware attack has downed key services, including 911 dispatch systems.  City officials confirmed on Wednesday that a number of the city’s servers had “been compromised with ransomware,” causing widespread service outages. The Dallas Police Department (DPD) website is currently offline. The City of Dallas website displays a message stating that “the City is experiencing a service outage and is working to restore services,” and the city wrote on a page that contains updates about the incident that all courts were closed on Wednesday and would be closed again on Thursday. DPD spokesperson Melinda Gutierrez confirmed to TechCrunch that the outage has also impacted Computer Aided Dispatch, or “CAD” systems, which are used by dispatchers and 911 operators to prioritize and record incident calls. Local media reported that this has forced 911 call takers to manually write down instructions for responding officers.  “There is no effect to 911 calls at this time, and they continue to be dispatched for service,” Gutierrez added. “The outage is not affecting police response.” Printers on the City of Dallas network reportedly began printing out ransom notes on Wednesday morning. As per a copy the note, the Royal ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for the attack, and a URL included on the note directed to a contact form on Royal’s dark web victims site. The note said critical data was encrypted, and threatened to publish it online if a ransom demand is not met.  The City of Dallas has not yet been listed on Royal’s dark web leak site and it’s not yet known what types of data has been stolen. City officials have not responded to TechCrunch’s questions.  The Royal ransomware gang first emerged in early 2022, and was recently the subject of a joint advisory released by CISA and the FBI. The U.S. government agencies warned that the group has targeted multiple victims both in the U.S. and internationally, including manufacturing, communications, education and healthcare organizations. The advisory said that after gaining access to victims’ networks, typically via callback phishing, whereby hackers send emails claiming that the victim has or will be charged for a service and asks them to call a listed phone number for clarification, Royal hackers “disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data” before deploying the ransomware and encrypting systems. Subsequent ransom demands made by the group vary from $1 million to $11 million. The City of Dallas has yet to confirm whether the hackers have made any financial demands.  TechCrunch contacted CISA and the FBI regarding the City of Dallas ransomware incident but has not yet received a response. According to ransomware expert Brett Callow, there have been 29 reported cyberattacks targeting local governments in the U.S. this year alone. The full impact of the attack remains unknown. In a statement, the city said it was “actively working to isolate the ransomware to prevent its spread, to remove the ransomware from infected servers, and to restore any services currently impacted. The City is currently working to assess the complete impact, but at this time, the impact on the delivery of City services to its residents is limited.” Do you have more information about the City of Dallas ransomware attack?

44,"Whoops, using crypto and cannabis don’t mix after all",['@Haje'],"April 11, 2023","Life comes at you fast. A couple of months ago I wrote how Smoakland was testing a loophole to sell cannabis by credit card. The test failed, apparently. “Upon further review, it has come to our attention that the way the process was described in the article could potentially be seen as bank fraud. As a result, our process partner has terminated our relationship,” said Smoakland’s director of marketing and e-commerce Jeff Dillon, in an email to TechCruch. It seems as if Smoakland isn’t the first vendor who’s gotten bitten by this. Posabit is a specialized point-of-sales system for dispensaries. It did at some point offer the ability to buy crypto on a credit card and use that to buy weed, but that has disappeared from its current offering. In fact, the site updated its FAQ with a statement, saying “Why is credit card processing illegal? (…) Simple: Cannabis is categorized as a Schedule 1 controlled substance at the federal level, which makes it illegal. This hinders credit payment processors from deliberately working with cannabis businesses.” This wouldn’t be the first time cannabis dispensaries have gotten into hot water over trying to figure out ways of receiving payments. Eaze, another of Smoakland’s competitors, tried to find a workaround to be able to charge credit cards, by obfuscating what the charges were for. It sent two consultants to jail, and had the CEO pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The U.S. district court of the southern district of New York looked pretty dimly at its workarounds, stating in an omnibus memorandum, that “The Scheme involved the deception of virtually all of the participants in the payment processing network, including issuing banks and credit unions in the United States and Visa and MasterCard, through the use of fake merchant names, fake merchant locations, fake descriptions of the merchant activities, and fake merchant descriptors.” In other words: It seems that the government is continuing to take a dim view on circumventing the federal legislation around payment processing. That isn’t slowing down the Smoakland team much, though: “We will now be moving forward with a bank-sponsored merchant services solution that allows users to pay by credit card,” Dillon said, and notes that the company is still pushing forward on being able to sell its wares and charge credit cards: “We approach the upcoming 4/20 date and having the ability to process credit cards would be a significant strategic advantage for us.” NOTE: This story was updated to clarify the Eaze case, which was unrelated to its crypto payment solution."

46,CeFi and DeFi in the face of regulation,[],"April 13, 2023","The full magnitude of the impact of the current market volatility in the wake of the collapse of FTX is still unknown. The dominoes keep falling and it is hard to predict how many more projects and organizations will end up being affected. What is undisputed is how the entire industry has been impacted and that the conversation about crypto regulation has risen to the forefront. Calls for regulation have come from every corner: from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calling for “more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets” and G20 leaders bringing up the need “to build public awareness of risks to strengthen regulatory outcomes and to support a level playing field, while harnessing the benefits of innovation.” U.S. Senators Warren, Smith, and Durbin have cited the dangers of “charismatic wunderkinds, opportunistic fraudsters, and self-proclaimed investment advisors” while urging Fidelity to scrap its 401(k) Bitcoin plan. Notably, the SEC has taken a series of high-profile actions with respect to different projects — for example, against Kraken and its staking-as-a-service program, and Paxos in relation to the stablecoin, BUSD. The SEC also proposed an amendment to expand custody rules to include crypto assets, which could limit how any crypto custodian, including exchanges, could interact with crypto. This came in the wake of a joint warning issued to banks in January by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and OCC to be wary of digital asset firms, signaling that they were closely monitoring the crypto activities of banking organizations. For the web3 ecosystem to scale, consumers need accessible ways to enter crypto. This means both DeFi (decentralized finance) and CeFi (centralized finance) will have to evolve to meet the demand. These actions are seen by many industry players as further indication that the SEC is doubling down on its attack against crypto and furthering its claim to jurisdiction over all aspects of the industry. While regulatory scrutiny has been focused on the crypto industry for some time, the magnitude of FTX’s downfall has created a climate in favor of crypto skeptics. Many are calling for a referendum against the entire industry, painting a picture of cryptocurrencies and blockchain as an industry dominated by self-serving, manipulative and reckless profiteers. Most expect the worst: A reactive blanket crackdown on all aspects of crypto, framed as necessary to protect the public from future bad actors, seems imminent. But there are some measured voices. One of those came from JPMorgan, which observed that “all of the recent collapses in the crypto ecosystem have been from centralized players and not from decentralized protocols.” JPMorgan’s report reaffirms the long-term institutional optimism: “We see the establishment of a regulatory framework as the needed catalyst to massively ramp the institutional adoption of crypto.” The report emphasizes the distinction between DeFi and CeFi. A similar sentiment was expressed by Jake Chervinsky, chief policy officer at the Blockchain Association. The “middle of the bell curve” take is that FTX will trigger harsh regulations for everything in crypto, DeFi included. I don’t think so. Policymakers will have to investigate every last detail about FTX, and they’ll finally be forced to see how different DeFi is from CeFi."
47,Internet abuzz over suspected redesigned Tesla Model 3,"['Harri Weber', 'Matt Burns']","April 13, 2023","Did someone just leak the front half of Tesla’s long-awaited Model 3 refresh? Car internet is abuzz over a photo that — some Redditors suspect — could show an update to the automaker’s sedan, with a revised face that has inspired some comparisons to the Roadster. Here’s the photo that’s now making the rounds: Image Credits: Reddit / ffiarpg Image Credits: Reddit / ffiarpg Tesla kicked off Model 3 deliveries in 2017, and the vehicle hasn’t changed a whole lot since then, aside from an updated console, wheels and a range boost in 2021. Tesla’s next big Model 3 update is reportedly codenamed Project Highland, per a 2022 Reuters story, which detailed the automaker’s efforts to cut costs via “fewer interior components and a slightly redesigned exterior.” Still, keep your skeptic hats on, folks. Tesla has yet to confirm any of these details. The image featured here shows several interesting features. The front bumper is different, and thankfully void of the fat lip of the current Model 3. There’s no fog lights, but the photo features a sleek, redesigned headlight assembly. The wheels look to be two-tone, and the dashboard is either covered or is redesigned to curve up in front of the driver. Overall, the design looks more sporty than the current Model 3. The Model 3 isn’t alone with its aging looks. Tesla has yet to significantly redesign any of its vehicles since their launch. The Model S sedan received the most substantial update of the lineup when, in April 2016, Tesla released a new version featuring an updated front end with a body-color bumper in place of the faux radiator grill. The rest — the Model X, the Model 3, and the Model Y — have only received slight tweaks to their external sheet metal. It’s unknown if the vehicle featured here is the next Model 3 or perhaps a rolling design prototype. But one thing is clear: This particular vehicle has some miles on it. Look at all the bugs.  "
48,Startup founders are trying to automate the worst part of the job: Fundraising,['@nmasc_'],"March 29, 2023","With a drier than normal investment scene, founders are looking for more effective ways to reach the right VCs. To that end, over the past few weeks, thousands of founders have applied to land capital through a common app, but instead of hoping to land into a university, they’re hoping to land capital from top investors. The platform they’ve been using is Seed Checks, launched by venture capitalist and growth marketing entrepreneur Julian Shapiro around one month ago. Founders are invited to apply using a one-minute form that asks for a deck, memo and region. The app is then blasted to 16 investors, including Conviction’s Sarah Guo, Mercury’s Immad Akhund and CapitalX’s Cindy Bi — all of whom have unilateral or individual check-writing capabilities.   There aren’t many restrictions, though the group only invests in startups valued under $20 million (a quick scan of submissions suggests that most that apply are valued between $5 million to $10 million). Further, the Seed Checks crew does not invest in any CPG or DTC products. The applications are reviewed every two weeks, and, if a startup is of interest, the founders will hear back within two weeks after deck submission. So far, the tool is resonating: After launching on Twitter and Product Hunt, Seed Checks received 2,000 applications over two weeks. SmartPass co-founder Peter Luba, who is building a digital hall pass for schools, was part of the first application batch. The founder is undergoing the fundraising process for the very first time since deciding to turn SmartPass from a side gig into a full-time startup. Since applying to Seed Checks, he’s started conversations with four of the investors from the cohort. Luba found out about Seed Checks from scrolling on TikTok. Up until then, the process of mass emailing numerous investors at once was more informal. The closest thing to a common app-style pitching process was through super-connectors in Silicon Valley, who would connect him to 10 investors all on one email thread (talk about FOMO). “Fundraising is a full-time job, it’s super time-consuming and I want to get back to building,” Luba said. “Not that this isn’t fun, but it’s not why we’re building a company.” Some aren’t as immediately thrilled with the idea of automation. Sanjay Goel, founder of NachoNacho, was first dubious about the idea of any platform that tries to scale fundraising. He changed his perspective when he saw the “very smart” investors involved. He’s interested if the caliber will help make this effort scale better — but as a three-time founder, Goel still believes that fundraising is “a relationship-based activity.” The entrepreneur, who also invests, says that platforms like Seed Checks can be one source of deal-flow, but he would not want it to be the only one. Shapiro sees the platform as filling a gap in a marketplace dominated by accelerators that offer a standard deal and programming in exchange for equity. Seed Checks is landing applications from founders who historically didn’t apply to accelerators because they didn’t need the help or introduction to a broad swath of investors; they just wanted access to the faces of the platform. The platform isn’t alone in trying out the common app style of pitching. Afore Ventures launched a common app program back in January; as of eight weeks ago, it has received 1,600 startup applications, or around 200 applications a week. The investor pool has grown from 10 investors, to 30, to 52 individuals or firms.   Bi, a solo general partner building CapitalX, hasn’t made any investments from the initiative yet — but she said Seed Checks is more effective than her own inbox in landing new deal flow. She adds, “the combined brand is much stronger than one.” “People who wouldn’t normally pitch to me, one GP with a $250K check, would now pitch to a group of VCs with potential to get [a million dollar] check,” she said to TechCrunch. “It’s more efficient for founders. “Why didn’t other smaller funds do this before?” Bi’s comments track: While co-investing is common among early-stage venture capitalists due to the sheer size of checks and popularity of party rounds, efficiency is of evergreen importance among investors. Especially considering how solo GPs are struggling in today’s LP risk-averse landscape, concentrating on a group instead of individuals might help block out all the noise. “I know a lot of investors who are basically just investing in the best of whatever happens to hit their inbox, like whatever the top 10% of deals that hit their inbox is,” Shapiro said. Many, he says, are “not proactively” spinning up projects to pull deals toward them, whether through building a Twitter audience or publishing YouTube videos, or in the case of solo GPs, investing in an entire marketing apparatus that helps them get in front of more entrepreneurs. When Shapiro sought out the 16 investors that would make up Seed Checks, he said he was able to convince them to join because of the appeal of combining their collective social audiences to get better deal flow. “By putting our faces together, we were getting higher conversions from the founder submitting pitch decks and admittedly much better deals,” he said. Shapiro himself no longer directs people to his own website; he just sends them to Seed Checks. Another tool gaining steam is VC Sheet, built by Ali Rohde of Outset Capital and Shapiro. The duo created a website that publishes lists of investors based on their stage, location or startup vertical. It’s like a more refined, easier to search Crunchbase, Rohde explained. The issue with any tools helping with investor access is that it can be difficult to keep track of changing taste buds. In fact, TechCrunch once tried to create a guide to active venture capitalists, dubbed The TechCrunch List. It died.   Rohde said that VC Sheet is different from The TechCrunch List in that it is explicitly focused on helping provide intel on early-stage venture market; and instead of only offering investors focused on proptech, they opt for lists such as most active pre-seed investors of New York.  “For founders, it doesn’t make sense to get a really holistic deep view of the early-stage funding ecosystem because they’re gonna go through it once. So like, figure out who you need, move on, get back to building,” she said. “Again and again and again, we’re in these calls, talking to founders, and they ask us who they should talk to — and so it actually makes sense for us to spend some real time putting together that central repository — it does not make sense for a founder to do that.” Both VC Sheet and Seed Checks are free for founders and investors to use; neither are trying to become businesses or charge for access, which could play a role in its success due to accessibility.  Shapiro says that VC Sheet is trying to solve a larger structural problem around founders being able to find investor-startup fit, while Seed Checks is about getting in front of over a dozen top investors with priority and ease. “Seed Checks isn’t trying to be some giant fix on the VC ecosystem, it’s not being offered as a panacea,” he said. “It’s just another outlet for founders…a reflection of where fundraising might go for greater efficiencies and access.” If you have a juicy tip or lead about happenings in the venture world, you can reach Natasha Mascarenhas on Twitter @nmasc_ or on Signal at +1 925 271 0912.

Until last year, Clear Street had been operating with only capital provided from its co-founders. The company was founded in 2018 with a mission “to replace the outdated infrastructure being used across capital markets,” starting with a prime brokerage platform for institutional investors, said Chris Pento, co-founder and CEO. “The public U.S. securities industry, which moves trillions of dollars a day, still relies on mainframe technology from the 1980s. These legacy systems are entrenched in manual processes and siloed data, resulting in costly errors and expensive technical debt,” he said. “For many firms, replacing these antiquated systems would be like removing the engine from a plane in mid-air. It’s time-consuming and difficult to execute with fragmented technology.” Clear Street built its cloud-native prime brokerage and clearing system from scratch — including integrations with central clearing houses and the development of APIs — with the goal of “maximizing returns while minimizing risk and cost” for its clients by providing them with “everything they need to clear, custody, and finance U.S. equities and options,” according to Sachin Kumar, co-founder and CTO.  Those clients include roughly 200 institutional sized investors and hundreds of smaller active trading entities, according to COO Andy Volz, who declined to provide names, saying that those clients “prefer anonymity.” Long term, the company’s aim is to serve a variety of investor types across multiple asset classes on a global scale. Image Credits: Clear Street Image Credits: Clear Street Clear Street’s executives declined to provide hard revenue figures but noted that over the past year, the company has seen the number of institutional clients on its platform increase by 500%. Meanwhile, its daily transactional volume increased by more than 300%, and its financing balances increased by nearly 150%, they said. The company claims that its prime clearing platform processes 2.5% of the gross notional U.S. equities volume, which the executives say amounts to about $10 billion in daily notional trading value of U.S. equities. The company makes money by charging fees for transactions and the financing of public market securities. “We feel this structure is better aligned than other options in the current markets,” Volz said. Presently, the company has about 400 employees today, up from around 325 in April of 2022. In the last year, Clear Street launched capital introduction and repo businesses. It also made what it describes as “key hires in Europe and in the derivatives space.” The company plans to use its new capital to expand into new markets and asset classes as well as to expand its product offering to support the clearing needs of market makers, which it views “as a major growth area.”  Matt Roberts, co-founder and partner at Prysm Capital, believes Clear Street is unique in terms of its “differentiated user experience, real-time risk analytics and tools, and scalability” of its platform. Other backers in the company included NextGen Venture Partners, IMC Investments, Walleye Capital, Belvedere, NEAR Foundation, McLaren Strategic Ventures and Validus Growth Investors. In February, Clear Street announced that it had received an undisclosed strategic investment from IMC Investments, the venture capital arm of IMC, a proprietary trading firm and global market maker. In total, Clear Street says it has $700 million “in capital,” including its external raise. Prior to taking in equity investment, Clear Street says it raised debt from insurance companies and regional banks. Prysm maintains a minority stake in the company.

50,AMC+ plans to launch an ad-supported tier later this year,['@laurenforristal'],"April 17, 2023","As more media companies turn to advertising in order to boost revenue, AMC+ is the latest to announce an ad-supported version of its streaming service. Parent company AMC Networks revealed today that it plans to launch the tier in October 2023. Pricing details and the exact launch date for the ads plan have yet to be announced. The new offering will be sold to advertisers in the company’s 2023-2024 upfront presentation. AMC+ currently costs $8.99 per month and bundles content from AMC, BBC America, IFC Films Unlimited and Sundance Now, along with niche AMC-owned streamers like Acorn TV and Shudder. Popular content includes shows like “The Walking Dead” and “Mad Men.” “This is a big moment for AMC Networks and for our advertising partners, because it not only creates a fully-ad supported distribution ecosystem, it also allows advertisers to buy our shows, genres and franchises in a much more comprehensive and impactful way,” said Kim Kelleher, chief commercial officer of AMC Networks, in a statement. “With our new series content, library titles and other targeted streaming platforms that are all bundled into AMC+, partners can move beyond individual shows and even series and choose to ‘own’ whole genres and franchises, and drive messaging to target audiences no matter what they are watching or where. We’ve never been able to offer this level of sweeping yet highly focused reach before in such an effective and comprehensive way.” The announcement comes on the heels of Disney+ and Netflix launching their own cheaper ad-supported tiers. Overall, AMC+ is joining various streaming services that have already embraced advertising, including Max (formerly HBO Max), Discovery+, Hulu, Paramount+ and Peacock. In November 2022, James Dolan, chairman of AMC Networks, admitted that its streaming business wasn’t earning enough to make up for the loss of revenue from its traditional cable channels. “It was our belief that cord-cutting losses would be offset by gains in streaming… This has not been the case,” Dolan wrote in a memo to staff. In the memo, the company announced layoffs that would affect 20% of staff. Notably, AMC Networks CEO Christina Spade stepped down after less than three months in the role. It’s likely the company’s hope that a new ad-supported tier will help bring in more AMC+ subscribers. In Q4 2022, AMC Networks reported a total of 11.8 million paid streaming subscribers across all of its streamers — AMC+, Acorn TV, Shudder, Sundance Now, ALLBLK and HIDIVE."
51,"Huupe, a ‘smart’ basketball hoop startup, raises its game with $11M",['@ingridlunden'],"March 24, 2023","Basketball can be played just about anywhere and by anyone in the world, thanks to a confluence of factors that lower a lot of barriers: ubiquitous hoops set up in parks, schools, driveways and backyards. You can play with one or many, and the only other equipment needed is an inexpensive ball. But for those who want to improve their game or keep up training to play at a higher level, the options — as they do for all sports — narrow down considerably. A startup called Huupe (pronounced “hoop”) is hoping to change that with a new product built around the concept of a smart basketball hoop, alongside a content network of training videos that users can watch while playing. It’s raised $11 million to build that game plan. Co-leads on the round were Protagonist VC, Marvan Ventures (the firm from Milwaukee Bucks minority owner Keith Mardak), TRI Investments, and Kawn VC. Genesis Ventures and Reform Ventures (NBA player Thaddeus Young’s venture fund) also participated. Huupe’s product and business model combine a mix of hardware, software and media streaming. The physical component starts with a connected basketball hoop that picks up data about balls that are sunk through it, or hit it, or do not. It’s ruggedized and waterproof, and the startup says that it’s as robust as a regulation hoop. Behind that is the backboard, which is made from a video screen equipped with computer vision and covered by the same enforced glass used for backboards in professional courts. The video screen displays videos of basketball coaches, trainers and players that users can watch as training sessions all by themselves or as part of a group. The computer vision and the content work in tandem to track and respond to how people are playing and what they need to work on to get better. The experience is a little reminiscent of Peloton and other connected exercise equipment. As with many of those products, Huupe’s video screens can also stream other kinds of video content, be it basketball games or whatever it is that you want to watch. The full package starts at $4,995 and $6,495 depending on the size you order for the screen. You’ll also have to pay $30 per month for the app subscriptions for content on top of that. (It’s also offering a $1,000 discount for the first 1,000 pre-orders.) Huupe is clearly not subsidizing the cost of the hardware at those prices, but CEO Paul Anton told me that the idea is that over time, as production scales, overall prices will come down. The idea for the product came from the direct experience of the two co-founders. Anton and Lyth Saeed (COO) were childhood friends in Milwaukee who used to play basketball together, and when they got older and lived further apart — Anton studied IP law and moved to the Bay Area to work; Saeed was building his first startup, a transport app called QUp, in Dubai — they started talking about how they could play basketball remotely. “How could we still play basketball together in two cities?” Anton asked. The pair tried using chat apps and other kinds of hacks at first. But with the startup bug fully in effect in the middle of the last decade, eventually they decided to leap into the unknown themselves and started Huupe to answer that question. Huupe co-founders Paul Anton and Lyth Saeed. Image Credits: Huupe Huupe co-founders Paul Anton and Lyth Saeed. Image Credits: Huupe A hardware startup, as the saying goes, is hard, perhaps even more so for founders who have never built something like this before. Huupe has actually been around since 2015, and it was bootstrapped for years as the pair tinkered on the idea first as a side hustle and then as a primary focus, building prototypes in and outside the proverbial startup garage. Huupe eventually raised its first outside money, a seed round, last year. The story is a little grassroots like basketball itself, which is partly what seemed to attract investors. “We love the team; they are super scrappy and hard-working,” said George Bousis, the co-founder of Protagonist, which last year announced a $100 million crypto fund but invests in other kinds of tech, too. “They have a big vision of where they see the company going and, thus far, have a great understanding of the market; they’ve built a great product and have a ton of potential, given the early metrics. We really like the collaborative element of playing with friends in person or across the country and the sense/feeling of community that can be developed over time. It’s super fun, interactive, and actually works (admittedly, I’m pretty bad at basketball but found myself wanting to get better given the gamification/experience).” While the initial marketing push is aimed at consumers, Bousis believes there is market potential beyond that. “We think gyms/fitness centers, community courts/centers, schools, and so on are a natural fit.” The cost right now may be unnaturally low — the founders declined to talk about total actual cost when I asked — but Bousis pointed out that the average price of a premium basketball hoop typically starts at $2,500, and that is without the interactive and educational elements that Huupe has built in. Anton and Saeed tell me that some 4 million hoops are sold globally every year, and decades have passed with virtually no innovation on the basic structure of those hoops, so you can see where the beginnings of opportunity lie. (U.S. figures for overall basketball equipment sales have risen steadily for years, with a special boost during the peak of COVID-19.) Various startups have targeted hardware for different sports, but interestingly, a lot of the activity around basketball has been around gaming and gamification, with startups like Gym Class and Dapper Labs (which makes NBA Top Shot) catching the eye of users and investors. That means there are lots of directions, and not much in the way of competition or precedence, that Huupe might develop if it breaks through in the basketball equipment market. One avenue that it does not want to pursue, however, are other accessories or “peripherals” for basketball playing, like shoes, balls or anything else. “We are not into wearables,” Saeed said, classifying anything like connected shoes as part of that category. “We view using that as akin to cheating if it becomes too easy to do better.” That said, if people are using Huupe as part of their home fitness regime, then there is a merit to the program integrating with other trackers to measure activity. He added that the company is also considering other sports that are not unlike basketball: lacrosse, soccer and hockey are on its list. Updated with correct pricing!"
52,"Kenya’s Fingo partners with Ecobank, launches neobank on the back of $4M investment",['@ulonnaya'],"May 5, 2023","Yesterday, Fingo, a YC-backed Kenyan fintech, launched its neobank, which it developed in collaboration with Pan-African financial institution Ecobank Kenya. The Ecobank subsidiary unveiled the neobank, the first of its kind in the East African country, according to the pair, in an event with the country’s president, William Ruto, in attendance.  It’s taken a while for Fingo to get here since CEO Kiiru Muhoya and his co-founders James da Costa, Ian Njuguna and Gitari Tirima founded the Kenyan outfit in January 2021 to provide financial services that appeal to a fast-growing African youthful population that happens to be the youngest globally but the most financially marginalized. For young adults in Africa, opening an account can take several hours to days, with multiple in-person interactions and requirements to bring physical paper documents. In addition, they have to deal with expensive fees to send money and maintain their accounts. Yet, they still struggle to access savings, insurance and credit, financial services Fingo promises to deliver to its users; however, it is currently pitching them cheaper transfer fees, subsidized rates at pay bills, cash-back rewards and other features, including payment links and tailored savings plans.  After a $200,000 pre-seed round, Fingo got into YC S21 and raised $4 million in seed funding toward the end of that year. Multistage venture capital firm HOF Capital led the round with participation from Hustle Fund, Verdant Frontiers Fintech Fund, Goodwater Capital, Launch Africa, Chandaria Capital, Naiban (Nairobi Angel Network), Discovery Ventures, Chui Ventures, as well as from the co-founders of Monzo and Twitch and executives from Google, Facebook and Paytm. What followed was a signed partnership with Ecobank, and Fingo began integrating its software with the bank toward launch while simultaneously waiting for regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), which finally came in Q1 this year.  The Fingo App. Image Credits: Fingo The Fingo App. Image Credits: Fingo Before giving the green light, the CBK, all that time, tried to understand the framework Fingo and Ecobank had set up for their relationship, especially as it concerns data, transactions and customer interactions. Unlike Nigeria, where collaboration between banks and fintechs is commonplace, allowing the latter group to launch fast (ultimately contributing to why the country has attracted most of Africa’s fintech funding), it is few and far between in Kenya. Fingo claims to be the first Kenyan neobank, so it’s pretty understandable, looking at how long it took to get approvals and go to market. Meanwhile, Muhoya noted on the call that despite the wait, the fintech still has the majority of its venture capital it raised in the bank because it maintained its 15-man headcount and barely had any expenses other than paying salaries and developing its software. So it isn’t raising additional capital for operations, especially in this challenging fundraising environment.  Now that the partnership has been approved, the Fingo Africa app will offer its users a bank account “under 5 minutes,” paired with free peer-to-peer transactions and immediate access to multiple services such as savings, financial education and smart spending analytics, the company said in a statement. The fintech says it has acquired 10,000 active users with a waitlist of 100,000 customers within 24 hours of launch. However, it will have its work cut out for itself if the plan is to onboard millions in a market where mobile money reigns supreme (Safaricom’s M-Pesa controls over 90% of that medium) and a banking sector dominated by the likes of KCB and Equity Bank (which have their digital banking products).  Fingo’s partnership with Ecobank, which claims to have the most significant footprint of any bank in Africa, covering over 30 countries, might provide the scale the fintech needs outside Kenya. Both entities are planning a Pan-African rollout, with an imminent expansion to the rest of East Africa by the end of the year, according to Muhoya. Digital banking counterparts that serve consumers in that region include Finclusion and Koa.    “Our partnership with Fingo Africa is a critical milestone in our mission to equip Africa’s youth with the essential financial tools they need to succeed. Together, we will launch youth-focused financial products, including quick access to bank accounts, savings options, and cost-effective transactions, across Ecobank’s pan-African footprint,” said Diallo Djiba, Ecobank Group’s senior fintech advisor, in a statement. “We are excited to extend our current solutions through this partnership and to be at the forefront of youth banking in Africa. Our aim is to reach millions of young people across the 33+ African markets where Ecobank operates.”"
53,Twitter alternative T2 readies expansion with launch of invites system,['@sarahintampa'],"April 25, 2023","The Twitter alternative T2, founded by Twitter and Google veterans, is ready to expand. Launched into alpha testing earlier this year, T2 will today begin to roll out its first invites to its small community of testers, allowing them to bring their friends to the service, instead of only offering waitlist sign-ups as before. Currently, T2 has less than 1,000 users on its social networking platform, which makes it a much smaller service than the increasingly popular Twitter clone Bluesky, backed by Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey. Recently, Bluesky said it has grown its user base to around 20,000 people, despite also being in an invite-only mode. Plus, it now has native apps for both iOS and Android, while T2 only offers a web app for the time being. Starting today, each T2 user will initially receive five invites to start, which the team hopes will bring on board at least 500 to 1,000 news users who will have immediate connections to someone else on the platform. The company notes that invites aren’t the only means of joining T2 — it will continue to onboard users from its waitlist, as well. After the initial five invites are expired, users will be able to @ the main T2 account, the founders or reply to the email they received with the initial invites to request more. This would presumably make T2 easier to get into compared with Bluesky, where invites are still somewhat scarce. There appears to be greater consumer demand for Bluesky than there is access, as the app has seen some 240,000 installs, per data sourced by data.ai — a figure that’s much larger than the actual Bluesky community. That lack of access could possibly push people to try T2 instead. Though it’s far too early to determine a winner in the race to become the “new Twitter” as Twitter itself flounders under Elon Musk’s chaotic leadership, T2’s potential advantage is in its leadership. T2 co-founder Gabor Cselle sold his prior companies to Twitter and Google before founding T2, while co-founder Sarah Oh was Twitter’s former human rights advisor. The startup also recently brought on Discord’s former Senior Director of Engineering Michael Greer as its new chief technology officer. However, much like Bluesky, T2 so far is only offering what feels like a stripped-down version of Twitter without all the extra features like DMs, Communities, Bookmarks, Lists, Trends and others. And while Bluesky is based on the AT Protocol, a decentralized social networking protocol and alternative to ActivityHub (which powers the open source Twitter alternative Mastodon), T2 has not yet committed to federating its content with ActivityPub. “We’re looking into that, but we don’t have any concrete plans right now around decentralization,” Cselle told TechCrunch last month. He also said the team had begun playing around with the AT protocol, adding that they’re “tracking it with curiosity,” but don’t have plans around federation. To date, T2 has largely been targeting former Twitter users to join its network. It even launched a verification system that allowed Twitter’s elite to retain their “legacy” Twitter verification checkmarks before those were removed by Musk. Today, 40% of T2’s community are verified users — either “legacy verified” or having gone through T2’s own verification process to receive a checkmark of their own. T2 says the new invites will be sent out via email, starting today.  "

Welcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.  If there was any doubt that China is a leader in EVs, the Shanghai Auto Show should have erased those thoughts. China is developing and producing compelling EVs and reaping the sales as a result. (Eight of the top 10 best-selling EV models in China are from Chinese automakers.) And unlike the U.S. market, these are not just premium and luxury brands that only a slice of society can afford. BYD, the Warren Buffet-backed Chinese automaker, unveiled its Seagull EV during the show and the unassuming vehicle attracted some of the largest crowds at the show. Industry watchers believe that this vehicle , which starts at 78,000 yuan ($11,300), is poised to become the top-selling EV in the country. China is already the world’s biggest market for EVs. But as the Financial Times noted in its coverage of the auto show, China is also set to push Japan out of the top spot for global car export volume this year after overtaking Germany in 2022. This development creates a two-fold challenge for foreign automakers. After years of dominating the premium and luxury market in China, foreign brands Buick, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others are facing homegrown competition. And now that China is exporting its vehicles to Europe, these same automakers are facing pressure in their own territory as well. To be clear, I don’t expect Chinese brands to make a big play for the U.S. market just yet. But I am closely watching how these brands fare in Europe. Some of our Shanghai Auto Coverage: • Chinese luxury EV brand Zeekr expanding to Europe by end of 2023 • The Polestar 4 replaces a rear window with a high-def screen • Luminar wants to light up China’s smart vehicles • XPeng’s G6 SUV aims to be a premium EV for the masses • Volkswagen pumps 1B euros into China electric vehicle center Want to reach out with a tip, comment or complaint?

Acer’s Ebii is an AI-assisted e-bike with sci-fi vibes. It’s got an onboard brain that adapts to riding conditions, has a rear collision warning radar sensor, an integrated headlight and taillight that turns on automatically at night and crash detection built into the app. All that, plus 70 miles of range. It’ll launch in Europe starting September for €1,999 ($2,194). Arcimoto is seeing another leadership shuffle. Board member Chris Dawson is replacing interim CEO Jesse Fittipaldi, who will stick around as president and report to Dawson going forward. Austin is providing rebates of up to $600 on e-bikes bought by Austin Energy customers. Curtis Motorcycle Co. introduced The 1, its debut electric two-wheeler that it’s calling the “Tesla of Motorcycles.” Only for $120,000, that’s around three times the cost of a Tesla Model 3. I’ll grant, it’s a pretty bike — part retro, part Mad Max. And it has a range of 120 miles for highway riding, 75 miles for city cruising. I’d be curious to see what, if anything, could possibly warrant such a price tag. Electric Bike Company launched the Model J, a small, nimble, moto-inspired e-bike with a reasonable limited time price tag of $1,199. Built in California, the bike has a minimalist hipster feel about it — a colorful matte aluminum frame with a leather seat and option for wooden trimmings. That and a battery range of up to 200 miles make it an attractive deal. Gazelle’s new line of e-bikes are aimed at commuters and casual long-distance riders. They’ve got stepless (or automatic) gearing that puts the assist at the right level for the rider at that time. Gogoro is working with Enel X to add its battery swapping stations in Taiwan to Enel’s virtual power plant network. Lyft pretty much has a monopoly on bike share in U.S. cities. But the company is struggling to stay afloat and has had to make drastic cuts to programs and staff to stay in the ride-hail game. (And Friday the company’s new CEO said more cuts are coming.) Curbed digs into the potential consequences of one tech company controlling bike share. Neuron found in a recent study that 5% of riders have a disability or mobility impairment and use e-scooters to overcome pain and other issues on their daily commutes. Swapfiets, a Dutch micromobility subscription service, has introduced a fast-charging, heavy-duty e-bike for delivery workers. Unagi has secured Best Buy as a partner to sell its e-scooter subscriptions.  Startups in the ground transportation business have another source of funding to chase: Autotech Ventures has closed a $230 million fund. The $230 million fund, its third since launching in 2017, will be used to invest in seed through Series C mobility-related startups, according to the company. A mixture of financial and corporate LPs, including Allison Transmission, American Axle, Iochpe-Maxion and Shell participated in the fund. The VC firm is still sticking to its early-stage ground transportation startup roots. But the firm’s investors are expanding that strategy and going after what they believe are the next big opportunities in automotive and mobility. Fintech, logistics, supply chain and the circular economy are at the top of the list. Other deals that got my attention this week … ChargeLab, an EV charging software management startup based in Toronto, secured $15 million in new financing to their Series A, doubling funds previously raised and bringing the round’s total to $30 million. The expansion included $10 million in new equity financing and $5 million in venture debt. The company’s first Series A tranche of $15 million led by King River Capital was previously announced in May 2022. Cowboy successfully raised €1 million ($1.1 million) in two days through a crowdfunding campaign. Evermile, a local delivery platform built for small businesses, raised $6 million in a seed funding round led by 10D. Mensch Capital Partners also participated. Miovision Technologies, a Canadian traffic management technology company, acquired Global Traffic Technologies LLC from Vontier Corp. for $107 million. GTT-developed technology allows emergency vehicles and transit to trigger traffic signal changes. Miovision also raised $260 million in a funding round led by Telus Ventures with participation by Maverix Private Equity and Export Development Canada. Novalith Technologies, an Australian startup that has developed a novel lithium extraction method, raised A$23 million ($15.4 million) in a Series A funding round led by Lowercarbon Capital. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Grantham Environmental Trusts’ Neglected Climate Opportunities Fund, TDK Ventures and Investible also participated. Skarper, a London-based company that developed technology to convert bikes into e-bikes, raised nearly $5 million in a round led by the Starry Group and Mobilitech Capital. SK On, a South Korean battery maker, could raise 1.5 trillion won ($1.1 billion) from BlackRock, Singapore-based Hillhouse Capital, Qatar Investment Authority, North Asia-focused MBK Partners and other financial investors. The deal would give the consortium a 5% stake in SK On. Whisper, which developed a quiet and efficient electric propulsion device for eVTOLs and delivery drones, raised $32 million in a Series A round led jointly by Menlo Ventures, EVE Atlas, Capricorn’s Technology Impact Fund and Connor Capital. Additional participation came from Kindred Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Moving Capital, AeroX Ventures, Cosmos Ventures, Linse Capital and LaunchTN, a public-private partnership with the state of Tennessee.  Tesla scored a victory after a California jury determined the automaker was not to blame for a 2019 crash that involved its advanced driver assistance system, known as Autopilot. The jury awarded no damages to Justine Hsu who sued Tesla in 2020. Apollo Go, Baidu’s robotaxi service, has hit some milestones recently. The service now has more than 100 fully driverless vehicles operating in Wuhan, and in 2022, the company doubled its active users, with some riders taking nearly 1,000 trips. Kodiak Robotics is partnering with truckload carrier C.R. England to autonomously haul Tyson Foods products between Dallas and San Antonio, Texas. (A human safety operator is still behind the wheel.) Uber is expanding its partnership with sidewalk delivery robot startup Cartken to Fairfax, Virginia. BorgWarner will invest $42 million into the expansion of its Seneca, South Carolina production facility, including the development of new manufacturing lines to launch the production of 3GWh of annual battery module capacity. Bugatti is getting ready to go electric. Einride is expanding to the U.K. Its first U.K. deployment will be in partnership with PepsiCo snack-food subsidiary Walkers, which will use Einride’s trucks and platform to deliver goods between the cities of Leicester and Coventry. Jaguar Land Rover has rebranded to JLR with four main brands: Defender, Discovery, Jaguar and Range Rover. Yup, that’s right, you did not see the Land Rover in there. The company is also continuing its push into EVs. The first car under the Jaguar brand will be a four-door electric GT with a range of about 435 miles (under WLTP) and a more than $124,000 price tag. On a side note: JLR also selected Elektrobit to supply its software platform and automotive OS for its next-gen EVA Continuum electrical architecture that will come to JLR’s full line of vehicles beginning in 2024. The U.S. Treasury updated its list of electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 EV tax credit per its new rules for battery sourcing. It initially appeared that Rivian would lose the entire tax credit. The EV company clarified that current model year 2023 R1T and R1S vehicles qualify for $3,750 in federal tax incentives, as the batteries are compliant with the critical mineral sourcing requirements passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. Tesla kicked off Q1 earnings season on a bit of a down note. The company’s EV price-cutting strategy boosted sales, but at the expense of profits. Tesla earned $2.51 billion in net income in the first quarter, a 24% drop from the same period last year. Tesla has repeatedly reduced the price of its four EVs — the Model S, Model X, Model Y and Model 3 — in the United States as well as Europe and China (including the day before earnings). That strategy has helped push revenue in the first quarter to $23.3 billion, a 24% pop from the same period last year. But it has also squeezed the automaker’s traditionally robust automotive gross margins. Aston Martin appointed Ferrari’s former chief manufacturing officer Vincenzo Regazzoni to the newly created position of chief industrial officer and Giorgio Lasagni as chief procurement officer. Hyzon Motors named Dr. Bappa Banerjee as chief operating officer effective May 1, 2023. He was most recently vice president of mining equipment at GE Transportation. Lyft is about to make some deep cuts to its workforce — as many as 1,200 people, or 30%, according to WSJ, which cited unnamed sources. We know the layoffs are coming, per an email sent to employees by newly appointed CEO David Risher, who informed them that the company is “significantly reducing its workforce” as part of a restructuring effort. Risher said the restructuring is part of Lyft’s plan to “better meeting the needs of riders and drivers.” That’s code — at least for me — that other programs and services outside of ride-hailing will be axed. What’s less clear is how this might affect its bike-sharing service. Redwood Materials hired Cal Lankton (former Tesla exec focused on energy sales/infrastructure and most recently Lyft’s EVP of fleet and global ops) as its chief commercial officer, per his post on LinkedIn."
55,Precision fermentation’s capacity craze: Have we lost the plot?,[],"April 24, 2023","Using microbial organisms like yeast and fungi as cell factories to produce animal proteins, Pat Brown and his early team at Impossible Foods kicked off the modern precision fermentation industry. Within a few years, Clara Foods, Geltor and Perfect Day were using the technique to produce a variety of egg, dairy and collagen ingredients. By the late 2010s, these first movers raised hundreds of millions of dollars and dozens of other startups followed in their footsteps. Today, recognition of the industry’s promise is mainstreaming. Environmental figures like George Monbiot are declaring that precision fermentation “may be the most important green technology ever.” Supporters are positioning it as a promising solution to the constrained supply of conventional animal products. Given the fervor, investors, as well as the commentariat, are prodding companies to begin large-scale production ASAP. So, the industry’s conversational spotlight has now fixed on: How do we build enough capacity to meet future demand, which could soar into the tens of millions of tonnes by 2030? A tantalizing and no doubt important question. To get the economics right for large-volume commodity food products, the precision fermentation industry would do well to focus on a few areas.

However, this almost singular focus on capacity is troubling. It seems to imply: The unit economics of precision fermentation are essentially solved and all that remains is to build factories. We will eventually need lots more factories, yes. The precision fermentation sector should not be bashful about its pursuit of an all-out biomanufacturing industrialization, a necessary condition to outcompete animal agriculture. But we must also stay honest to the science, which says the crucial work to be done in precision fermentation for cheap animal-free alternatives is not simply building or enabling capacity but rather designing new or radically improved production systems. I’ll let you in on an open secret: Leading scientists and technologists from the industry and academia tend to tell me — often in hushed tones and sometimes only off the record — that the economics of food-grade precision fermentation is nowhere near competing with commodity dairy or eggs. This problem, they warn, will not be solved by simply upscaling to larger tank volumes. At best, scaling up production to immense tank volumes will reduce costs by 35% to 40% instead of the many-fold reduction needed."
56,Investors prefer debt over equity (but not venture debt),"['Jeremy Abelson', 'Jacob Sonnenberg']","April 18, 2023","We are in very interesting times today. It’s rare to see so many tectonic shifts happening in real time: High interest rates, declining equity values, SVB and other banks failing with a continued contagion risk and a recession looming. There has been an aggressive shift in assumed equity returns compared to fixed income returns. The data tells a clear and extreme story. Simply put, equity risk premiums (ERPs) have broken down well below the ranges that were established since 2008. The ERP calculates the projected S&P returns versus the returns of 10-year treasury bills (data from Morgan Stanley). The below chart is important to the startup audience because it speaks to why fundraising is extremely challenging right now and why valuations are coming down so dramatically. Opportunity cost is powerful indeed. For the venture world specifically, this dynamic is compounded by the venture debt markets cooling, which in turn makes equity the most viable option for most. Image Credits: Irving Investors Image Credits: Irving Investors Waiting for a rebound in public market multiples to preserve previous valuations has not proven to be a good strategy. Deployment of VC capital continues to slow down. SVB measured the inflow and outflow of deposits by a metric called total client funds (TCF), which has been negative since the first quarter of 2022 (five straight quarters now). This trend is continuing in 2023: VC capital deployment declined another 60%, and deal count has dropped about 25% from a year earlier. Declining venture activity combined with dropping ERPs is a clear signal that there needs to be a material correction in private tech company valuations. However, anecdotally, we have seen that private company valuation expectations have remained lofty relative to obvious public comparables."
57,TechCrunch Live is going to Atlanta and you’re invited!,"['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Matt Burns']","May 2, 2023","Atlanta, Georgia has emerged as one of the buzziest new hubs in the nation, with booming enterprise, cybersecurity and SaaS sectors, as well as a slew of investors looking to back the hot new startups coming from the city. Some well-known companies from Atlanta include Calendly, Kabbage, One Trust and FullStory — all unicorns, by the way. Many, like Calendly, passed through Atlanta Tech Village, which has served as an incubator for the city’s talent ecosystem since it was founded in 2012 by David Cummings. Register here for this free TechCrunch Live event Record labels, such as Quality Control, the musical home of the Migos, now have an investment arm, and the local HBCUs, like Morehouse, have their own entrepreneurial and innovation centers. Even the Atlanta Hawks launched their own investment firm to back early-stage talent. In fact, ATL hails itself as so committed to fostering its tech ecosystem that it appointed a chief technology officer, or, as some informally dub the role, a city Tech Czar. Naturally, the next step was TechCrunch spotlighting the city to showcase all that is new and upcoming. Investors and founders have long expressed excitement about what is happening in the region. Last year, Atlanta startups raised around $1.65 billion, according to PitchBook; though an about 47.9% decline year-over-year, that amount is still the second-highest funding allocated to the city in recent years. “The venture capital opportunity in the South is better than it’s ever been,” Lisa Calhoun, a general partner at Valor Ventures, told TechCrunch+ last year. “A lot of new founders are starting companies at astonishing rates; in terms of deal flow, we’ve never had so much.” Tune in on June 7th at 10:00 ET as TechCrunch Live unpacks what is happening in the Atlanta tech ecosystem. Though much of the event is under wraps (stay tuned), we can promise an exciting slate of panels and articles to showcase the city’s culture and commitment to becoming a tech hub. Trust us, this is not an event you will want to miss, so stay posted for updates, and we hope you can join us as we officially welcome you to Atlanta. PS: If you are an early-stage Atlanta-based founder, please apply to pitch to our panel of guest investors/judges for our live pitching competition; the winner gets a free booth at TechCrunch Disrupt this year to exhibit their company in our startup alley."
58,Tech investors’ obsession over profit is already waning,['@alex'],"April 17, 2023","When it became clear that the public market had forever descended from the peaks of 2021, venture investors decided to break camp and head downhill as well, advising their portfolio companies to focus on lowering their burn because capital had suddenly become expensive. Why the focus on cost-cutting? Because conserving cash is an easy way for startups to postpone fundraising, giving them more time to both increase their revenue and potentially wait for tech valuations to recover. But new data indicates investor preference is moving akin to a pendulum: They wanted startups to scramble and change their focus from a “growth at any cost” mindset to becoming profitable at low cost when things went to hell, and now they’re already looking for growth again. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. For startup founders, the rapid change in investor preferences may feel like a whipsaw. But such an evolution in market preferences is actually rather logical and, frankly, somewhat boring in how it plays out. To illustrate, let’s first look at the data, and then let’s talk about what startups should take away from the information. After all, it’s the weekend, so we can stretch our legs a little. To work! The cloud team at Bessemer — the venture fund that built the public market cloud index that we often use as an indicator of tech valuations — has put together another yearly report that came out this week.

59,Your BeReal posts can now include what you’re listening to on Spotify,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 19, 2023","Spotify is launching a new integration with BeReal that lets users include in their BeReal post what they’re listening to on Spotify. BeReal encourages users to take a photo everyday at a random time with their front and back camera in order to show an authentic version of themselves. Spotify says its integration with the company adds another layer of authenticity to the daily posts. You can connect your Spotify and BeReal accounts by tapping on the music icon that’s shown before posting a BeReal. Or, you can navigate to your settings in the BeReal app and tap on “music” and follow the prompts to connect the app to Spotify. Once your accounts are connected, the app will automatically pull in the song or podcast you’re listening to on Spotify at the time you capture a BeReal. You’ll see the cover art of the audio you’re listening to at the bottom of your camera lens. If your friends’ posts include audio, you’ll be able to listen to a preview of what they’ve shared. “Spotify was built for moments of everyday inspiration, discovery, and interactivity. It also creates the playlist for your everyday life,” Spotify wrote in a blog post. “BeReal is designed to capture and share authentic moments in your daily life with your closest friends. Combining audio from Spotify with BeReal adds another layer of authentic personalization and connection to your BeReal.” Starting today, BeReal and Spotify users on Android and iOS in select markets, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and the U.S., can access the integration. The companies plan to bring the integration to more countries in the future. The integration comes at a time when the hype around BeReal is significantly slowing down. The number of people who use the app daily has dropped 61% from its peak, from about 15 million in October to less than six million in March, according to analytics firm Apptopia. The photo-sharing app was quite popular last year and took social media by storm through its bid to provide users with a more authentic photo feed compared with the curated aesthetic found on Instagram. The app’s success led to major social media platforms, like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, scrambling to clone the app within their own products to capitalize on the popularity. BeReal’s new integration with Spotify likely won’t be a huge turning point for the company, but it could sway its current loyal users to engage with the app in a new way. Unlike other popular apps, BeReal isn’t regularly updated with new features and offers a pretty straightforward product, so the addition of a new feature that’s still rooted in authenticity is likely a welcome change for users."
60,Why the startup sector should keep its eye on the SEC,"['Anthony Cimino', 'Holli Heiles Pandol']","April 9, 2023","With the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, the U.S. startup ecosystem lost an important business partner. But the greater fallout could be what’s coming next: a spate of tighter regulations directed not just at midsize banks like SVB — but also at private companies and funds. Although SVB’s failure can’t be blamed on the venture ecosystem, some policymakers have joined the general public in maligning the bank’s depositors — in large part venture-backed startups. This negative narrative has immense implications for the venture community. This is an inflection point. In a shift from the last two decades, policymakers and regulators had already begun to scrutinize the private markets. If more lawmakers become convinced that Silicon Valley companies require greater supervision, the consensus could embolden the SEC to accelerate its agenda for increasing regulation in the private markets and fundamentally altering venture as we know it. And the scale of the SEC’s proposed reforms should alarm entrepreneurs, investors and employees in the innovation economy. Three key areas of proposed intervention by the SEC offer examples of why the venture community should be paying attention. The SEC’s current agenda — a public list of the regulations the agency is considering — contains proposals that will increase barriers to capital for companies and funds, constrain investor access and potentially push more companies from private to public. In short, the SEC’s actions could slow one of our greatest engines of innovation. Three key areas of proposed intervention by the SEC offer examples of why the venture community should be paying attention: Public and private markets are regulated differently by design. The policy framework for private issuers — companies and funds — was built to streamline their ability to raise capital, operate and innovate with fewer regulatory restrictions. Because private companies are typically earlier in their lifecycle, they are subject to fewer compliance and disclosures requirements. The SEC is looking to change that by making changes to Regulation D, the mechanism that allows private companies and funds to raise capital without registering their securities or going public — it is the framework that most startups and funds use to raise capital. Signals suggest the Commission could require companies that raise capital under Reg D to disclose more financial and company information. But these disclosures carry significant financial costs for small, private companies — and they carry the extra risk of exposing sensitive financial information to competitors and large corporate incumbents. Moreover, penalties for noncompliance could permanently damage a company’s ability to raise capital. Last year, the SEC also proposed rules that could make it harder for emerging fund managers to raise capital by introducing new prohibitions for venture capital advisers, who are not typically regulated by the SEC. Congress purposely carved out venture capital from SEC registration, but the SEC nonetheless proposed rules that would indirectly regulate VC by prohibiting common industry practices. Two in particular that are worth highlighting: Private market investments tend to be earlier in a company’s life cycle and without as much information as public company investments. Consequently, they are seen as riskier than investing in real estate or the public markets. To protect investors, the federal securities laws restrict participation to high net-worth individuals, as well as those with financial certifications that demonstrate sophistication. At present, the income threshold for accredited status is $200,000 for individuals ($300,000 for married couples) or net worth of at least $1 million (excluding primary residence). The SEC is likely to propose raising these thresholds, potentially indexing them for inflation reflective of regulation’s 40-year history and limiting what assets qualify for the wealth test. Doing so would exclude a large swath of the population from private market investment. This would restrict more people from investing in growth-stage companies that can deliver strong returns and from diversifying their investment portfolio. It is investor protection through investor preclusion. Further, higher wealth thresholds would have an outsized impact on smaller markets where salaries and cost of living and asset values are lower. Such action would further engrain the coasts as the capital centers for the private markets — even as promising venture hubs have begun to emerge in places like Texas, Georgia and Colorado. It would also limit access to capital for underserved and underrepresented founders and fund managers, who often lack access to more traditional networks of wealth and power. Perhaps the most impactful changes under consideration by the SEC would be to Section 12(g) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which defines the number of “holders of record” a company can have before it is pushed into the public markets by being subject to the same reporting requirements. While the SEC won’t be able to change this fixed number (currently 2,000) because it’s set by a congressional statute, it is considering changing the way “holders” are counted or adding new triggers to essentially force larger private companies to go public. One potential change would “look through” investment vehicles, such as special purpose vehicles or SPVs — which are currently counted as one “holder” — to count each beneficial owner. This change would penalize diversification and disadvantage less affluent investors who pool their capital to compete with the larger investors who dominate the space. Other suggested changes to 12(g) could create earlier triggers based on company valuations or revenues. These artificial boundaries would undermine a growth-stage company’s ability to raise capital by effectively capping the return on investments. They could also have the unintended consequence of increasing market concentration by making growth-stage companies more vulnerable to acquisition by competitors when they approach a valuation or revenue threshold. Founders and investors need to remain informed about these proposed changes: You can follow the latest SEC news and make your voices heard by engaging in the rule-making process by submitting written comments. The private markets were central to the American economy’s recovery from the Great Recession and continue to drive innovation and healthy competition in U.S. markets. Restricting entrepreneurs’ access to capital and their ability to grow into large and profitable enterprises would come at the tremendous cost of innovation and job creation."
61,"In congressional hearing, TikTok commits to deleting US user data from its servers ‘this year’",['@sarahintampa'],"March 23, 2023","In his testimony before the U.S. Congress this morning, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the company plans to delete all U.S. user data from company servers by year-end. The commitment was shared as part of Chew’s opening statements, which detailed the company’s initiative known as Project Texas. The plan involves the relocation of U.S. user data to Oracle servers based in the U.S. where the data would then be overseen by American personnel. The plan is one part of TikTok’s larger agenda to stop the popular video entertainment app from being banned by the U.S. government over national security concerns. The company also aims to convince Congress that it has a number of protections included in its app designed to keep younger users safe, and is heavily relied on by both U.S.-based creators and small businesses to generate income, among other things. With Project Texas, however, TikTok’s mission is focused on what Chew referred to as a “firewall” that would seal off protected U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access — meaning, of course, the CCP.  In a bit of good branding, the name “Texas” refers to where Oracle is headquartered. TikTok’s general plans for Project Texas were already known — the company last June wrote to Republican senators to assure them how it was working on an initiative to bolster data security for U.S.-based users. The letter was written in response to earlier congressional outreach that had followed a report from BuzzFeed News that claimed some China-based employees had access to TikTok U.S. user data. In TikTok’s response, it explained how it intended to relocate and safeguard the data. However, the letter did not then commit to a time frame for the data’s relocation.   In the testimony this morning, Chew gave TikTok a deadline for that move, noting the company expected to delete data from its own servers this year. The company also said it’s spending $1.5 billion on Project Texas. “Today, U.S. TikTok data is stored by default in Oracle’s service,” Chew said. “Only vetted personnel operating in a new company called TikTok U.S. Data Security can control access to this data. Now additionally, we have plans for this company to report to an independent American board with strong security credentials. Now there’s still some work to do,” he continued. “We have legacy U.S. data sitting in our servers in Virginia and in Singapore. We’re deleting those we expect that to be complete this year,” he said. “When that is done, all protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. This eliminates the concern that some of you have shared with me that TikTok user data can be subject to Chinese law,” Chew added. TikTok had more privately shared this time frame with Congress ahead of today’s hearing. The company’s attorneys wrote in a letter dated March 7 that TikTok would begin the process of deleting non-public historical U.S. data this month. That letter had stated TikTok anticipates that this deletion process would be completed this year. Later in the hearing, the exec was also questioned on other aspects of TikTok’s data security, including whether or not it would commit to not selling U.S. user data to anyone. Here, Chew couldn’t provide a straightforward answer. After initially responding that TikTok wouldn’t sell to data brokers, he said he would have “get back to you” on the details around whether or not it sold data to anyone, after being pushed to answer more directly. In addition, the CEO couldn’t clarify if Project Texas would completely separate TikTok from its Chinese parent, as there could be technologies that were interconnected. Asked if there was “shared technology” or interconnected “I.T. systems,” Chew said the company would “have to get back to you.” Plus, when questioned about whether or not any employees in China would have access to U.S. data, the exec responded, “After Project Texas…the answer is no” — an answer that begs the question as to how many Chinese employees could access the data now. The exec was also questioned as to whether or not Chinese ByteDance employees were subject to Chinese law, including the 2017 National Intelligence Law which requires any organization or citizen to assist and cooperate with state intelligence work. Chew sidestepped answering at first by noting that, “like many companies, including many American companies, we rely on a global workforce including engineers in China.” Asked again to respond just yes or no, he then said “in the past, yes, but we are building Project Texas and we’re committed to firewalling off all protected data.” "
62,Mastodon now has a simpler sign-up process,['@indianidle'],"May 2, 2023","Decentralized social network Mastodon announced that it is making it easier to create an account on the fediverse — or at least its own server. Now, when you try to sign up on Mastodon, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server. One of the prime complaints of joining the Mastodon network has been the complicated flow of sign-ups for different servers. This process can be overwhelming as compared to a centralized social network such as Twitter or Instagram. Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko said in a blog post that this new feature is not taking away users’ choice of picking a server or moving to a different one after signing up. They can select “Pick my own server” if they want to join a different instance. Rochko also mentioned that the upgraded onboarding makes it easier for people to get started and understand the advantages of decentralization later. “You may be asking, how a default server option furthers decentralization. We believe it’s important for Mastodon to be good as a product on its own merits, and not just because of its ideology. If we only attract people who already care about decentralization, our ability to make decentralization mainstream becomes that much harder,” he said. “This gives us a far better chance of showcasing what decentralized social networks have to offer instead of having that person bounce and never hearing from them again.” Last year, after Elon Musk took over Twitter, several users started to register on Mastodon to find an alternative network. At one point Rochko’s team had to stop sign-ups to mastodon.social to ensure good quality of service.   With the latest update, the social network is upgrading its infrastructure and moderation tools to ensure smooth and safe experiences for users. Additionally, Mastodon is soon rolling out improvements like quoted replies and better content and profile search along with ability to create groups. This will make it a more competent social network for people trying to build followings and communities. Hopefully, these features will make it to third-party Mastodon clients like Ivory, Mammoth and Woolly. In the last few weeks, Jack Dorsey-backed decentralized Bluesky has seen a lot of activity. While the network is still in invite-only mode, the organization recently launched an Android app, rolled out new moderation tools, shipped new developer tools and crossed the 50,000-user mark. The network has a similar design to Twitter when it comes to interacting with posts, and that makes it attractive to users who might want to go to an alternative network."
63,"LLMs come to workplace morale monitoring, as Loopin raises $1.9M for its platform",['@mikebutcher'],"April 17, 2023","There have been several startup attempts to measure staff morale, some more halting than others. We reported on Plasticity Labs back in 2014, though their web site seems no longer functioning. Officevibe appeared around the same kind’ve era. More recently out of the U.K., WorkBuzz has raised £2.3 million. And Spill ($3.5 million) is a startup that offers a message-based therapy app to help improve workplace well-being. But now a Bristol-based U.K. startup hopes to make waves in the “workplace measurement” space, and it plans to use the rocket fuel of generative AI. Employing a combination of OpenAI’s ChaptGPT, combined with its own proprietary coaching platform for staff well-being, Loopin hopes to break out from the rest of the field. Now, it might be easy at this point to shrug at yet another startup pulling an OpenAI API. But this is not your average startup. The two founders are battle-hardened: former Royal Marine Commandos Ben Williams and Antony Thompson. After leaving the armed forces, Ben went into coaching leadership teams at corporates, including the England Football Team and Manchester United. He also wrote the 2020 book “Commando Mindset,” published by Penguin. These two highly trained, former special forces soldiers have now poured all their knowledge — as well as academic research papers and other data — into training data for their platform on how to build teams. And that’s the difference. On the surface of Loopin is the daily “check-in” via Slack or Microsoft Teams. Employees share small updates on their mood, using emojis, which are anonymized for privacy. Trained on Ben’s coaching methodology and based on each team’s data, Loopin’s “virtual coach” then provides managers tips on how to better support their team and unlock better performance. Team managers can also share their status with higher-up managers, in order to get help on how to boost team moral, as you can see from the below video: Loopin says its platform uses NLP, as well as employing Chat GPT (currently in Beta), to assess the team’s mood, and generate predictive behavioral analytics, measuring and forecasting team morale. Ultimately, Loopin sees itself as becoming almost like a marketplace for morale and performance coaching inside businesses. Loopin has now raised a £1.6 million ($1.9 million) seed funding round from angel investors. The company says it already has 40 paying customers, including Reed, Farfetch and JD Sports. Stuart Neal, former general manager of Boku Identity (acquired 2022, Twilio) and chairman of Loopin, says there’s a post-pandemic need to rack staff morale: “At any one time, a staggering 45% of employees are actively thinking of leaving their job. The average cost of replacing an employee is £30,000 so the price businesses are paying for low morale is huge.” There is of course, competition in the market. Steven Frost, CEO of WorkBuzz, which has raised £2.6 million is also in the “employee listening” space, focusing on mid-market organizations with 500-5,000 employees. He told me clients include brands like Five Guys, Premier Foods, The Priory Group and public sector organizations like HS2. Their funding round was led by Mercia and Foresight Group. He told me: “Our AI guides them where to focus on improving and we can evidence the ROI. Employee listening is now a must-have given talent shortages, changing employee expectations, and hybrid working.” However, Loopin’s Williams told me during an interview: “Our competitors measure data and then present it back to the company often through metrics, dashboards and lots of graphs and different things like that. And that’s not a bad thing. But is that actionable? No. Is it useful and valuable in the moment? It’s okay to look at it and it’s helpful, but it doesn’t help the people that really need it, which is the employees and the managers. So, essentially, we’re acquiring that data, adding our own proprietary data and then we’re applying it to open source AI models to be able to provide personalized coaching and leadership development advice back to the employees in real time. And that’s why we believe we’re different.” He added that Loopin will eventually take anonymized data from companies to allow them to benchmark themselves against other, similar, external organizations: “One thing we’re eventually bringing into the product is benchmarking. Where does your company sit against other companies and engagement and morale and how do you see where you sit?” Simon Wingate, managing drirector at Reed (3,500+ employees), a Loopin customer, said in a statement: “What we lacked was a real-time measure of our teams’ mood and motivations. We use Loopin as a way of really understanding how our teams are feeling and to ensure we are driving a better quality of connection between managers and their direct reports.” It would appear the race is on to employ AI in the workplace in order to supercharge teams, but this time powered by LLMs."
64,Digital identities might be the best way to prove who you are online,['@jacqmelinek'],"April 19, 2023"," One of the biggest drivers for digital identity is to be able to verify who you are and that what you’re saying is real amid the extreme (and somewhat scary) growth of artificial intelligence technology. While there’s a lot of hype around owning your own digital identity, there is a lot of growth that needs to happen to expand the sector and protect people. Just this week, a song featuring the voices of Drake and The Weeknd garnered over 250,000 Spotify streams and 10 million views on TikTok. But the musicians weren’t even involved in the process. The song was generated by an artist named Ghostwriter who used AI to generate the artists’ voices. (Both Spotify and Apple have since pulled the song from their services.) “As more and more of these AI deepfakes come out, it’s becoming harder to know if it was [them] or not,” said Sandy Carter, COO and head of business development at Unstoppable Domains. “There are methods we can [use to] validate that you’re human and a person, and [digital identities] could help as the need grows stronger as more AI technology comes out.” Unstoppable Domains is one of the biggest web3 domain providers in the world and has integrated with over 800 platforms, including Coinbase, OpenSea and Rainbow Wallet, among others. It has about 1,000 partners, and last year, the platform raised $65 million in a Series A at a valuation of $1 billion."
65,Hackers are increasingly using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook,['@carlypage_'],"May 3, 2023","As public interest in generative AI chatbots grows, hackers are increasingly using ChatGPT-themed lures to spread malware across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. That’s according to Facebook’s parent company Meta, which said in a report out Wednesday that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices. “In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. “They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.” Meta says that attackers distributing the DuckTail malware have increasingly turned to these AI-themed lures in an attempt to compromise businesses with access to Facebook ad accounts. DuckTail, which has targeted Facebook users since 2021, steals browser cookies and hijacks logged-in Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim’s Facebook account, including account information, location data and two-factor authentication codes. The malware also allows the threat actor to hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has access to. Meta on Wednesday attributed the distribution of DuckTail to threat actors in Vietnam, adding that it had issued cease-and-desist letters to the individuals behind the operation and notified law enforcement. Meta said it blocked malicious links that pointed to fake ChatGPT-themed pages that host and deliver malware. Image Credits: Meta (supplied) Meta said it blocked malicious links that pointed to fake ChatGPT-themed pages that host and deliver malware. Image Credits: Meta (supplied) The social media giant also noted a new malware it discovered in January called NodeStealer. Much like DuckTail, the malware targets Windows-based browsers with the ultimate aim of stealing cookies and saved login details to compromise Facebook, Gmail and Microsoft Outlook accounts. Meta said it took early action against the malware, which it has also attributed to Vietnamese threat actors. Meta said it submitted takedown requests with domain registrars and hosting providers, which were malware targeted to facilitate its distribution, within two weeks of discovering the malware. “These actions led to a successful disruption of the malware. We have not observed any new samples of malware in the NodeStealer family since February 27 of this year and continue monitoring for any potential future activity,” said Nguyen and Victory. Meta said it has also added new features to help business users of its products better fend off malware attacks. This includes a new support tool that guides people step-by-step through identifying and removing malware and new controls for business accounts to manage, audit and limit who can become an account administrator. Meta also announced it will launch Facebook at Work accounts later this year. These accounts will allow business users to log in and operate Business Manager without requiring a personal account, helping prevent attacks that begin with a compromised personal account. Or, perhaps it’s finally time to delete your Facebook account?  "
66,"Pinecone drops $100M investment on $750M valuation, as vector database demand grows",['@ron_miller'],"April 27, 2023","When Pinecone launched a vector database aimed at data scientists in 2021, it was probably ahead of its time. But as the use cases began to take shape last year, the company began pushing AI-driven semantic search. With the rise of LLMs in the public consciousness, companies are beginning to see the value of vector databases even more. Investors apparently agree. Today, the company announced a $100 million Series B investment on a $750 million post valuation. These kinds of numbers have been hard to come by in a conservative investment environment, but the company is growing fast and investors saw an opportunity to grab a market leader, says Pinecone CEO and founder Edo Liberty. “We are clearly the creators of this category and the leaders in it. When we came out with this, with the vector database category, nobody knew what the hell we’re talking about. Now of course, this is a well-formed market and the category has different players, and so incumbents and clouds and so on, and we’re clearly ahead. And so it’s very easy to bet on the leader of a category that is already formed,” Liberty told TechCrunch. That first-to-market advantage is helping them grow from a handful of customers last year to 1,500 today, and Liberty says the growth rate is more like a consumer tool than a highly technical database. The company is seeing interest from businesses of all sizes, including technology companies like Shopify, Gong and Zapier. “This is like consumer-based adoption of B2B deep tech stuff. I’ve never seen anything like this. And so you have to accelerate the building of those capacities, and that’s very expensive and very hard,” he said. He says interest in LLMs is driving interest in the vector database, but it’s a different proposition. While both take large amounts of data and let you search on them, with an LLM the data is baked into the model, and therefore less flexible, while the vector database is built for semantic search, but has the flexibility of a database. “This whole knowledge management scheme ends up being a lot more flexible, a lot more efficient, a lot easier to operate [with a vector database],” he says. He points to GDPR compliance as an example. If you have to delete a record, it’s fairly trivial to do in a database, but it’s much more difficult to remove bad data from a model because of the way it’s structured. Peter Levine, who is leading today’s investment for Andreessen Horowitz and will be joining the Pinecone board, sees the vector database as a key piece of the AI stack. “We believe that this vector database and especially Pinecone has the opportunity to be really a fundamental component in the new AI data stack. And so we really feel very strongly that putting the resources behind the company is going to help it achieve Edo’s end vision,” Levine told TechCrunch. What’s more, Levine sees the vector database working together with LLMs to act as a source of truth, one that could presumably cut down on the hallucination problem we’ve seen with LLMs. “Well, they work together. I mean, think of the LLM as an application almost that sits on top of this database, and what the database will do is it will hold information and feed it into LLM for more precise answers for long-term storage of results,” he said. Liberty similarly thinks of this as the database acting as the long-term memory for the LLM. With a $100 million runway, the company will be hiring. It’s up to around 100 employees today, and Liberty expects to get to perhaps 150 or 200 by the end of year. The vector database space has been heating up since Pinecone launched a few years ago with players Qdrant, Zilliz and Chroma, all raising funds recently. Today’s investment was led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from ICONIQ Growth and previous investors Menlo Ventures and Wing Venture Capital. The company has now raised $138 million including a $28 million Series A last year and a $10 million seed investment in 2021."
67,AI startup Fourthline locks down $54M to bring better ID checks and compliance tools to the finance sector,['@ingridlunden'],"April 3, 2023","As digital financial services become more advanced, so too do the efforts of malicious hackers and fraudsters to crack into those valuable systems, as do the efforts of regulators to build better structures to avoid that abuse. To help the finance sector meet those demands, an Amsterdam-based startup called Fourthline has built a set of AI-based solutions to help with identity verification, help businesses comply with anti-money laundering rules and more. Today, it said it has raised €50 million ($54 million) in funding to expand that technology. The all-equity round is being led by Finch Capital, with other undisclosed investors (one of whom is a strategic institutional partner, I’ve been told). Fourthline has been around since 2013 — building its tech for five years before commercially launching in 2018 — and it has been mostly growing on its own steam, with only €70 million raised to date, including this latest €50 million injection. The valuation of the company is not being disclosed. In the five years since its launch, growth has been impressive: Fourthline’s customers include N26, Qonto, Trade Republic, FlatexDEGIRO, Scalable Capital, NN and Western Union, as well as marketplaces like Wish. And business has grown 80% annually in the last five years. In all, it says its tech helps vet “millions” of consumers every year. At a time when we are seeing a lot of controversy about the potential for artificial intelligence to be misused and abused, the problem that Fourthline is tackling, in a way, is one perfectly suited to powers of artificial intelligence in the best of ways. Its premise is based on a few key facts: There are many routes bad actors can take to exploit digital financial services, whether that’s by stealing data, by impersonating people or taking other approaches to steal money or move funds illicitly. Humans are obviously an important part of the solution to combat that. But the proliferation and growing sophistication of malicious approaches, which are coming from humans but also machines and sometimes AIs, makes the challenge of addressing those malicious approaches and fraud attempts increasingly difficult. Thus, the thinking goes, AI-based approaches that use computer vision, machine learning and immense data crunching to detect when something is not as it should be are not just helpful, but a must-have. Fourthline’s technology currently encompasses around 200 checks, covering areas like examining ID documents, parsing biometric data, checking records for place of residence, verifying names against sanction lists and more. Some of these might be straightforward database checks, but others are very much complex moving targets. That part will be getting more R&D resources with this round of funding on top of what Fourthline has already invested. “We’ve invested heavily on the authentication side,” Krik Gunning, CEO and co-founder of Fourthline, said in an interview. That includes, he said, “looking at ID and passports in different ways.” The company claims this approach is able to identify 60% more fraud with an accuracy rate of 99.98%. There are a number of startups that already exist to help fintechs and others be compliant in areas like KYC (know your customer) regulation and ID verification, but Gunning pointed out that the norm is to take a very different approach: companies have largely built solutions that typically lean on using APIs and core technology built by third parties, which is then customized by the startup in question. Fourthline has taken an alternative view: it’s better to build your own technology from the ground up using your own proprietary data sets, as this makes it easier to control and modify, and of course, in the long run, it also brings it better service margins, too. “We use our own OCR [optical character recognition] model for the number zone and another for the visual zone to check if it’s been tampered with. And yes, many have that, too, but we are then also able to address the flip side of that, which is much harder: to confirm if something is authentic but also pinpoint the reason why it might or might not be so.” This involves deeper investigations of ghost images and being able to understand even the lighting used in creating an image. “We’ve invested a lot to do this.” That is one key reason why it took years for the company to launch a single product. The company has a very streamlined view of how it goes to market. There are, for now, no plans to build services beyond KYC, AML and ID verification. So while credit scoring might look like a very adjacent and obvious opportunity, it’s not one that Fourthline will be pursuing for now. Similarly, this is why it’s only concentrating on the financial sector and not applying its tech or looking at business development with the many other sectors that might also buy ID services. Governments, which have tried to create universal ID schemes — with very fragmented results — are not customers. At least not right now. “There are a lot of companies in this space that do a lot with AI, but in all honesty, it takes a lot of time, investment, knowledge and training before you can get AI models to the level you want,” he said. “The only way you can do it is by focusing. We couldn’t do this for every sector in every region in the world, so this is why we do this where we can play a role. That is why we focus on financial institutions in Europe.” In a market rife with highly capitalized startups that have found it a struggle to live up to their valuations and growth expectations, Fourthline’s streamlined focus, proven returns and, importantly, technology built by its own engineers are examples of what is resonating with investors now, and what is likely seen as a more healthy basis for growing down the line. Radboud Vlaar, managing partner of Finch Capital, described it with as much economy as Fourthline has taken with its own approach: “We’re big believers in tackling the compliance challenges in this industry through a focused growth strategy leveraging a platform approach using proprietary technology.”"
68,Twitter singles NPR out with misleading state-backed media label,['@tayhatmaker'],"April 5, 2023","After taking over last year, Twitter’s new owner has invented policies on the fly, pushed questionable design changes and generally bent the platform to suit his whims. In the latest installment of Elon Musk’s mercurial leadership saga, Twitter now classifies American news nonprofit NPR the same way that it handles RT, the infamous Russian state-backed mouthpiece that pushes the Kremlin’s talking points to the broader world. Image Credits: NPR Image Credits: NPR NPR’s Twitter account on the once-essential breaking news platform now comes with a tag denoting it as “US state-affiliated media.” But NPR doesn’t meet Twitter’s own definition for a state-affiliated account: State-affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution… State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK for example, are not defined as state-affiliated media for the purposes of this policy. NPR, which operates with editorial independence, isn’t controlled by the U.S. government. And the news organization only received about 1% of its budget from federal funding in 2020.  The decision, which appears to have come out of the blue, may have as much to do with Elon Musk’s failure to understand the media as it does his tendency to settle scores by changing Twitter’s rules and functions. Based on Musk’s prior attacks on the press, it’s possible that NPR has some unflattering investigative coverage of the tech mogul lined up. But it’s just as likely that Musk is just flexing his influence to appease his fans and the upstart right-wing media outlets that he has repeatedly aligned himself with.  Just prior to waging war with NPR, Musk took aim at The New York Times. Twitter’s users waited with bated breath over the weekend in anticipation, waiting for the directive that all “legacy” check marks be stripped from previously verified accounts to come to pass. But legacy blue checks survived the weekend with one notable exception: The New York Times. Musk apparently revoked the NYT’s blue check himself after learning that the paper didn’t have plans to pay for his ill-conceived new pay-for-play verification service. Musk’s disdain for traditional news media was a major animating factor in his decision to buy Twitter to begin with. And as Twitter decays into an unpleasant slurry of stale jokes, amplified hate and paid prominence, Musk will likely continue to manipulate the social network to his own ends, right up until the wheels fall off or we all stop paying attention.

69,"Snapchat unveils new Story modes, updates to Snap Map, enhanced Bitmoji and more",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 19, 2023","At its Snap Partner Summit today in Santa Monica, Snapchat unveiled a series of new features coming to its app. The company is rolling out new Stories features, adding updates to the Snap Map, enhancing Bitmoji, introducing new ways to virtually interact with friends and more. Snapchat is launching two new shared Story modes, starting with “Communities,” which is a shared Story for interacting with people in the same school. With this new Story mode, users from the same school can see what other people on campus are up to, build new friendships and share their point of view. Snapchat has tested the new Story mode in certain schools, and plans to roll out Communities to additional colleges and high schools this month. Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat The second new shared Story mode is called “After Dark.” You can add to an After Dark Story after 8 pm. Snapchat sees the new feature as a way to relive last night’s highlights, whether you were up late studying for finals or went to a concert. Only the friends who posted to the After Dark story have access to view the Snaps when they’re shared the following morning. Snapchat plans to add a similar shared Story for early birds in the future. Snapchat also announced an update to Memories, its flashback feature that lets users reminisce on what they were doing on a given day exactly a year ago. The company is now launching “Friendship Flashbacks” that will surface throwbacks generated from the Snaps saved between you and a friend. The flashbacks will resurface directly in your conversations. Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat As for the Snap Map, the company is introducing a new location-sharing mode called “Live Location” that updates in the background. Prior to this update, you could only share your location with a friend for a set period of time, but now you can do so indefinitely. The new feature is similar to Apple’s Find My, as it constantly shares your live location with a friend. Snapchat is also enhancing the Snap Map and adding 3D visual elements. When you move around the new map, you’ll see local landmarks in a more detailed way. The company says the purpose of the new map is to allow users to explore their surroundings in a new way. The new updated Map will roll out to all users in the coming months. Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat In addition, the updated Snap Map will start suggesting places that Snap thinks users would want to check out. Snapchat is adding a new “Popular Last Night” tag to the Snap Map to let users see where their friends were recently hanging out. Jack Brody, Snap’s VP of Product, said during the event that the company found that when its most active users see places marked as “Top Picks” on the Snap Map, they’re 18% more likely to visit that place in person. As for AR, the company recently rolled out a Lens that lets users virtually appear together when on a video call say in a car or swimming together in the sea. To build on this, Snapchat plans to soon launch a more interactive Lens that lets users complete puzzles and play games together while they’re face-to-face on a video call. Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat Snapchat is also introducing a new Activity Center that makes it easier for users to stay up to speed on what their friends are up to. You can swipe down from the camera to access the Activity Center and see where your friends are on the Snap Map, get notified if your friend updated their Bitmoji outfit and see if it’s someone’s birthday. In terms of Bitmoji, Snapchat announced that it plans to launch an updated avatar style that features a more expressive look with realistic dimensions, shading and lighting. The company didn’t reveal any further details about the updated design but said that the change would be coming “soon.” Image Credits: Snapchat Image Credits: Snapchat As for Bitmoji clothing, the company announced that it’s bringing digital fashion from Marvel to its Bitmoji community. Users will be able to accessorize their Bitmoji with apparel inspired by characters in the Marvel Universe. Snapchat says that nearly 1.7 billion Bitmojis have been created globally, which is a significant increase from the 1 billion figure that it shared at last year’s Snap Partner Summit event. "
70,Bluesky invites become a hot commodity as demand for the Twitter alternative outstrips access,['@sarahintampa'],"May 2, 2023","Consumer demand for the Jack Dorsey-backed Twitter alternative Bluesky is outstripping access, according to the latest App Store data and figures published today by the company. In a new FAQ on Bluesky’s website, the company shares that its community has topped 50,000 users. However, estimates provided to TechCrunch by app intelligence company data.ai indicate the decentralized Twitter clone has seen over 375,000 worldwide installs on iOS as of April 26, 2023, and has been ranking highly on Apple and Google’s app stores’ top charts by downloads. Excitement for Bluesky has also been climbing in recent weeks, thanks to a combination of exclusivity — the app still requires a hard-to-find invite to get in — and the culture its community is creating. The latter has seen the app embrace what has been described as “early Twitter” energy, thanks in part to the numerous meme accounts and shitposting. This results in a sort of frenetic, chaotic vibe to Bluesky that’s attracting many former Twitter users and particularly those who haven’t quite meshed well with the more serious and structured environment found in the other decentralized Twitter alternative, Mastodon. But for the time being, Bluesky isn’t capitalizing on the outsized consumer demand for its app. While other would-be Twitter alternatives like Post and T2 have broadened access to their respective networks, Bluesky invites have become such a hot commodity they’ve been selling for anywhere between $120 to as much as $400 on eBay in recent days. Image Credits: eBay screenshot Image Credits: eBay screenshot Image Credits: eBay screenshot Image Credits: eBay screenshot Some sellers are now even testing the market for higher prices, as Bluesky demand increases. (Above: sold invites. Below: Bluesky invites for sale as of May 2, 2023). Image Credits: eBay screenshot Image Credits: eBay screenshot Consumer interest in the app has also been fueling its rise across the app stores’ top charts, data.ai’s analysis indicates. The firm found that Bluesky has gained over 375,000 iOS downloads globally, having peaked on April 15th with 66,000 downloads in a single day thanks to becoming the No. 1 app across all categories in Thailand. Before that, the highest level of daily iOS downloads was more than 22,000 on March 22, 2023. This 375,000 figure is up from the 240,000 iOS installs Bluesky had as of April 20th, 135,000 of which had come just that month, data.ai had recently reported.  The app launched on Google Play in late April, so insights into its traction on Android devices is still forthcoming. But the analysis indicates that, despite consumers’ lack of access to the new social network, Bluesky has managed to trend on the downloads charts across both Apple’s App Store and Google Play in several markets. In Japan, for example, Bluesky reached as high as No. 3 among social apps on Google Play by downloads on April 24 after previously reaching No. 8 among social apps on iOS on March 4. In the U.K., the app was No. 10 among social apps by Google Play downloads on April 26, shortly after reaching No. 10 among social apps by iOS downloads on April 23. The U.S., meanwhile, has been responsible for much of Bluesky’s more recent growth, the firm said. That’s helped the app reach No. 22 among social apps by Google Play downloads on April 26 and up to the No. 11 spot among social apps by iOS downloads on April 24. Because of its relative newness, data.ai said it’s not yet able to accurately predict the number of daily or monthly active users at this time. The rankings are impressive not just because the app is still fresh out of the gate, but because its community is still quite small. As of a few days ago, Bluesky accounts that aim to follow all the app’s users were following north of 45,000 people. However, according to the FAQ published by Bluesky today, the company says the community now has north of 50,000 users. The FAQ also attempts to clarify how access to invite codes will be distributed, noting that existing users receive just one invite every two weeks they’re on the app. Plus, the company shared that it periodically monitors the social graph, and if it finds that certain users are inviting “other trustworthy participants,” they’ll receive more invites. This aspect of the invite system makes Bluesky feel even more exclusive than if it were just slowly rolling out access to its waitlist. Instead, getting in now feels like a function of who you know. This has led to existing Bluesky users being asked daily — often by multiple folks — if they have any invite codes to spare. (In other words, your best bet to get a Bluesky invite is to become an existing user’s best friend for the next two weeks!) Bluesky says it’s limiting access to grow the network “organically,” but if that were the case, it would roll out a few more codes or increase the frequency in order to capitalize on the real-world demand, because that would still be considered organic growth. At this point, restricting invites to one every two weeks is artificially slowing the app’s growth. That appears to be by design. The company explains its thinking in the FAQ, saying that it needs to limit bad actors up front. “Social networks can be abused by spammers and bad actors who might want to manipulate the public conversation. It’s much easier to limit sign-ups and let them spread through an existing social graph than to try to retroactively clean up rampant network abuse,” the post reads. “Long-term, we view this invite code system as a piece of the open source tooling we’re building to help server admins (people running services) to help curate and moderate their communities,” it says. It’s not clear if the company believes its existing user base can’t be trusted to give out invites responsibly, or if it wants to have more of a hand in who gets in — and who stays out. But with Bluesky invites now selling to the highest bidder on eBay, the company’s plans for keeping out bad actors could be disrupted. The FAQ details other aspects of Bluesky’s plans, including its AT Protocol for decentralization, and its differentiators from Twitter, like algorithmic choice and composable moderation. It also tries to clear up the nature of Bluesky’s relationship to Twitter, as it was originally incubated in Twitter while Jack Dorsey was CEO. It was later spun out as an independent company (a PBLLC), having received $13 million from Twitter to kickstart its launch. Now, the FAQ notes that “Twitter closed its service agreement with Bluesky in 2022.” Jack Dorsey is still on Bluesky’s board. Bluesky was asked for comment on the new figures, but an automated response to press inquiries only pointed us to the new FAQ."
71,"Ford expects EV business unit to lose $3B this year, hit profitability in late 2026",['@kirstenkorosec'],"March 23, 2023","Any question of what business sector is — and is not — profitable at Ford is no longer a mystery. Ford lost about $3 billion on its EV and digital services business over the past two years, a unit now known as Model e, and isn’t expected to be profitable (on an adjusted basis that removes costs like taxes) until late 2026 with an 8% operating profit margin, the company said Thursday. Meanwhile, its commercial and traditional internal combustion engine business units were profitable enough to offset losses incurred by making and selling electric vehicles. In other words, profits generated from selling internal combustion engine-powered trucks, cars and SUVs have helped, and will continue to help, drive Ford’s push into EVs. Ford lifted the hood Thursday on how the restructured 119-year-old company will operate and, importantly, report its financials. Earnings reports, which Ford restated for 2021 and 2022, will no longer be broken out by region. Instead, financial reports, which includes revenue, profits and losses, margins and adjusted earnings, will give details on three global segments of business that cover EV and digital services, traditional internal combustion engine business and its commercial vehicles. And while CFO John Lawler stressed to TechCrunch that this is not merely an accounting exercise, the numbers do provide fresh insight into the company’s financial standing. “If we just did business as usual, I think what we felt is that the company wouldn’t change enough, the dynamics within the company would not have changed,” Lawler said in a recent interview explaining the decision to restructure. “It’s about focus. It’s about speed and accountability. And I don’t think we would see the clock speed increasing.” Last March, Ford announced plans to restructure and break the company into three segments: Ford Blue for its internal combustion and hybrid vehicles, Ford Pro for the commercial business and Ford Model e, which covers electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems and digital services. The newly formed Latitude AI, which is part of the ADAS team led by Sammy Omari, also falls under Ford Model e. The newly restructured company and its accompanying financials also breaks out Ford Credit, the company’s financing arm and Ford Next, which is where its longer-term pre-revenue businesses sit. The upshot? For now, the EV and digital services business, which Lawler said should be viewed as a startup, is unprofitable while the other two are gaining ground, on an adjusted earnings basis. As a recap, Ford reported in February that on an adjusted basis it earned $10.4 billion for all of 2022. Ford’s net income on an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2021 was $10 billion. On Thursday, Ford issued the restated earnings, which shows the Model e unit had losses of $900 million in 2021 and $2.1 billion in 2022. Ford currently has three EVs in its portfolio: the Mustang Mach e, the F-150 Lightning truck and the commercial transit van. Meanwhile, Ford Pro saw profits increase from $2.7 billion in 2021 to $3.2 billion in 2022. Ford Blue brought in the bulk of profits, earning $3.3 billion in 2021 and jumping to $6.8 billion in 2022. The automaker forecast that its Ford Blue unit will earn, on an adjusted basis, $7 billion in profits in 2023. Ford Blue will approach $6 billion in profits, nearly double its 2022 earnings. And Model e, the EV and digital services unit, is forecast to lose $3 billion in 2023, a loss driven by a number of capital projects including building new factories such as the $5.6 billion BlueOval city complex in Tennessee. Those costs also include work on future generations of EVs. Lawler said in a recent interview that the company is working on second, and even third-generations of its EVs. “We’re working on our second generation that launches mid decade,” Lawler said. “It’s a clean sheet of paper. It’s a completely different way of designing the vehicles. And in fact, we’re already working on our third generation when most of our competitors are just launching their first generation of vehicles. And so I think that puts us in a in unique position.” The company reiterated that Ford Model e will reach profitability before taxes by late 2026 with an 8% pretax profit margin. That milestone that is tied to planned EV production run rates of 600,000 units by the end of 2023 and two million by the end of 2026. Ford also confirmed that it expects full-year adjusted EBIT to be $9 billion to $11 billion and adjusted free cash flow to be about $6 billion. If Ford wants to hit those metrics, it will mean more than just producing and selling EVs. The company has struggled to keep its costs under control and improve operating efficiencies — a problem that many of its rivals have mastered."
72,Amazon will juice its Freevee free streaming service with 100+ Amazon Originals in 2023,['@sarahintampa'],"May 1, 2023","As part of its pitch to advertisers this week at the IAB NewFronts, Amazon announced today it has plans to bring over 100 Amazon Original series and movies from Amazon Prime Video to its ad-supported free streaming service Amazon Freevee (previously known as IMDb TV). The titles will be released throughout the year, the company says, noting this marks the first time marketers will be able to advertise against this group of Amazon Originals, and in a traditional ad format. Before, the only opportunity available to advertise on Amazon Originals on Prime Video was with virtual product placement, announced at last year’s NewFronts presentation. But traditional advertising, like ad break, had not yet been an option for brands within programming on Amazon Originals on Prime Video. According to Freevee’s announcement, some of the coming titles include popular programs and films like “Reacher,” “The Summer I Turned Pretty” (May 26), “The Wheel of Time,” “Troop Zero,” “A League of Their Own,” “LuLaRich” and “Late Night.” Other Originals will be released each month, offering advertisers access to Freevee’s audience across devices, including Fire TV. In many cases, the shows will not be offered in full, but will serve to entice viewers to subscribe to Amazon Prime Video. For instance, in May, Amazon Freevee will release the first three episodes of “A League of Their Own,” “The Terminal List,” “Paper Girls,” “Goliath” and “The Tick.” Other series may be available as full seasons, as with “Homecoming,” “Upload” and the sci–fi mystery “The Vast of Night.” These titles will continue to be available for streaming on Prime Video without ads, Amazon notes. The titles join other Freevee Originals from Amazon Studios, including “Bosch: Legacy” (whose Season 3 has just been greenlit), court program “Judy Justice” (also greenlit for S3 &4), coming-of-age drama “High School,” “Hollywood Houselift with Jeff Lewis,” comedy series “Sprung,” music documentary “Post Malone: Runaway,” cooking competition “America’s Test Kitchen: The Next Generation,” sports docuseries “Uninterrupted’s Top Class: The Life and Times of the Sierra Canyon Trailblazers,” and others. Image Credits: Bosch: Legacy, courtesy of Amazon Freevee Image Credits: Bosch: Legacy, courtesy of Amazon Freevee   Of course, Freevee more recently has become best known for the viral hit “Jury Duty,” which Amazon says has now seen over 200 million TikTok views to date for the hashtag #JuryDutyonFreevee. The show, a pseudo docuseries, films an unsuspecting person who believes he’s being filmed as part of a documentary on America’s justice system, but in reality, everyone he interacts with — from the judge to the jurors to courthouse personnel and more — are actually actors. Other upcoming Freevee Originals include a new court program “Tribunal Justice” premiering June 9 and the coming-of-age comedy “Primo” on May 19, co-written (and executive produced) by Mike Schur and Shea Serrano, whose stories from childhood are the basis for the semi-autobiographical series. Later in the day (and after the original publication of this article), Freevee also announced it greenlit a new court series, “Justice on Trial,” featuring Judge Judy Sheindlin, in the third series she’s exec-produced for Freevee. In addition, Freevee greenlit “Mock the Week,” which it described as “a half-hour topical and satirical panel show,” executive produced by Trevor Noah and Dan Patterson. And it announced a reality competition series, “The GOAT,” with stars from shows like “The Bachelor,” “Vanderpump Rules,” “90 Day Fiancé,” “Love is Blind,” and others In addition to Freevee’s ad-supported streaming video service, which includes thousands of TV shows and movies, of both original and licensed content, Freevee is also offering free ad-supported (FAST) channels. The latter is more like a traditional cable TV experience where you can immediately tune into something that’s livestreaming as soon as you launch the app. Currently, Freevee includes over 250 FAST channels in the U.S., with thematically programmed channels focused on movies and TV shows, plus exclusive Original channels from Freevee and Prime Video, and syndicated channels with partners like FOX Weather, PickleTV, Vevo and more. Amazon says it will expand its FAST offering by 75% in 2023. Competitor Roku has been working on expanding its FAST offerings as well, recently announcing a deal with creator company Jellysmack to launch new content on its service. As of March, it reported having over 350 FAST channels on its platform. As part of its release of Amazon Originals this year, Amazon says the Freevee Originals FAST channel will now be rebranded as Amazon Originals to reflect the larger lineup. Freevee is available in the U.S., U.K. Germany and Austria."
73,"Amazon tops LinkedIn’s list of best places to work, jobseeker priorities shift to workplace culture",['@ingridlunden'],"April 19, 2023","There have been more than 171,000 people in the tech industry laid off so far this year, according to data tracked by layoffs.fyi, but those looking for work are not in a “beggars can’t be choosers” mindset. According to new data from LinkedIn, people are gravitating to workplaces that align with their values, and their values include a range of factors like diversity and skills growth, not just how much money they’ll make. The company today published its annual list of best places to work, where Amazon held on to the top spot, and Google owner Alphabet dropped from number two last year to number five this year. The interesting thing about the rankings, now in their eighth year, is that they provide a snapshot of how individuals’ priorities are changing. Specifically, the rankings are based not just on practical assessments of — for example — what percentage of people were laid off, but also how companies scored on softer and cultural skills, which it said speak to how long a person is more likely to stay at a company. So, along with factors like “company stability” (companies had to have less than 10% workforce layoffs in the past year to qualify), other details like growth and learning opportunities, equity in the workplace and strong company culture, it said, are “of growing importance for job seekers as they prioritize organizations that align with their own values.” (The full list of eight factors: ability to advance, skills growth, company stability, external opportunity, company affinity, gender diversity, educational background and employee presence in the country.) LinkedIn’s conclusion: This more rounded view of workplaces has become more of the norm when it comes to where people gravitate to work, and that’s been the case even in a tight labor market where hundreds of thousands of people are getting laid off due to worsening economic conditions. In keeping with that conclusion, LinkedIn used the data to kick off a new tool it’s offering jobseekers when constructing their job searches. They now will have a filter to look for workplaces that have policies and priorities in areas like diversity and inclusion (DEI), career growth and learning, work-life balance, social impact and environmental sustainability. Via LinkedIn Learning, the company is also offering some free courses to help users learn how to seek out those job opportunities more effectively. Image Credits: LinkedIn Image Credits: LinkedIn LinkedIn itself and its owner Microsoft intentionally get left out of the rankings, but in addition to Amazon and Alphabet, just one other technology company made the top-10 list, Apple at number eight. Twitter, unsurprisingly, is not in the rankings at all, but nor are other biggies like Facebook owner Meta, Netflix and Samsung. Tech-adjacent AT&T was number six, while tech management consultancy Thoughtworks was at number nine. Others in the top 10 included banks (ironic given what’s been happening in the banking sector in the past few months), and two companies in the healthcare space, UnitedHealth Group and Kaiser Permanente. We’re publishing the basic full list below, and you can see the more detailed rankings and descriptions here. The bigger message here is that LinkedIn continues to tweak its platform to remain relevant in the employment game, whatever rules that game may take. LinkedIn, with 900 million registered users, has been a major hub for people looking for work in the so-called knowledge economy for decades at this point. In the last few years, it has made a number of efforts to be responsive to the socioeconomic wave that’s washed over us. The COVID-19 pandemic saw LinkedIn add in tools to help employers indicate which jobs could be carried out remotely without a need for relocation to offices that were unlikely to be open anyway. Then, the start of the layoffs tsunami saw a lot of people adopt LinkedIn’s “open to work” badge to flag quickly and visually to those browsing their profiles that they were happy to entertain job offers — a big shift away from the more discreet cues LinkedIn has built over the year to help users flag themselves to recruiters. The big question is whether or not factors like cultural values are a sign of our times, or if these parameters will remain permanent priorities among jobseekers, changing the bigger picture for how recruiters can capture the best talent — and indeed what “talent” will look like — in the future."
74,Lucid recalls hundreds of Air sedans over risk vehicles could lose power,['@kirstenkorosec'],"March 27, 2023","Lucid Group issued a recall for hundreds of Air sedans over a flaw that could cause the vehicles to lose power and increase the risk of a crash, according to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Newark, California-based automaker first filed a recall notice with NHTSA in February for 273 model year 2022 and 2023 Air vehicles after discovering that some electrically activated contact switches that transfer energy to the drive motors may unexpectedly open, cutting off power to the electric motors. That recall has since been updated to add another 336 vehicles, which require a software update to assess whether any contactor replacements are required, according to a spokesperson.  “For Lucid, the safety of our customers and their families is the highest priority, and we are working to resolve this issue as quickly as is possible,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Lucid will soon begin contacting the owners of affected vehicles to notify them of the recall and to provide further information.” Lucid said its service centers will update the vehicle software and replace the contactor switches, as necessary, free of charge. CEO Peter Rawlinson actually mentioned the recall during the company’s earnings call in February, noting that the company’s software capabilities were demonstrated through its recent decision to initiate a voluntary recall of a small number of Lucid Airs related to a supplier issue.  The recall wasn’t posted on the NHTSA website until recently and was included in its email digest Monday morning. “I want to be clear — we were not required by the government to do this. But we have an unwavering commitment to our customers,” he said at the time. “We were able to identify potentially impacted vehicles by sending a software update to our vehicles that allowed us to scan for a particular electrical signature within each car and thereby identify the less than 300 cars estimated to be potentially affected by this supplier issue.” Lucid has struggled with supply chain constraints for more than a year. The company produced 7,180 vehicles in 2022. Of those 4,369 were delivered. Lucid set 2023 annual production targets of 10,000 to 14,000, which is roughly half of the 20,000 to 22,000 deliveries analysts had expected for the year."
75,"The D’Amelio family won’t buy TikTok, but they thought about it",['@asilbwrites'],"April 20, 2023","Among dedicated TikTokers at the Information’s Creator Economy Summit, a far-off storm cloud looms: What if TikTok really does get banned in the U.S.? While TikTok has touted its Project Texas plan to further separate the American company’s operations from its Chinese parent ByteDance, the U.S. government also proposed making ByteDance sell TikTok to an American company. Marc D’Amelio, the father of TikTok superstars Dixie and Charli D’Amelio, said that he considered buying TikTok. In March, he tweeted, “I am putting together a group of investors to pursue the purchase of TikTok.” I am putting together a group of investors to pursue the purchase of TikTok. — Marc D'Amelio (@marcdamelio) March 18, 2023  The D’Amelios have created a media empire with their own retail brands and venture capital firm, but it’s a bold statement to propose buying a platform estimated to be worth at least $60 billion. As a whole, ByteDance is worth around $220 billion. When the Information reporter Kaya Yurieff asked about this proposal onstage at the Summit, D’Amelio said that it’s not quite on the table anymore. That’s not a surprise — it’s hard to just casually raise billions of dollars, and even if it were possible, China reminded the U.S. that it can’t actually force a sale. But when the patriarch of TikTok’s “first family” was pressed on this proposal, he revealed that he did legitimately consider the idea. “It’s very expensive,” D’Amelio conceded to Yurieff. But the idea went a bit further than a random tweet. “We’ve raised a lot of money for D’Amelio Brands, and we have the connections to do it,” he said. Ultimately, though, D’Amelio thinks the best possible outcome is for the U.S. to not follow through on any sort of legislation banning TikTok. D’Amelio Brands launched in September with $6 million in seed funding, which falls just a bit short of the price of TikTok. Perhaps the company has raised more capital that it hasn’t announced yet, but not enough to seriously pursue that purchase, which is why D’Amelio looked for other investors. So, while Charli D’Amelio might be the queen of TikTok, it doesn’t seem her family can literally buy the app.  "
76,How to ask OpenAI for your personal data to be deleted or not used to train its AIs,['@riptari'],"May 2, 2023","Users of ChatGPT in Europe can now use web forms or other means provided by OpenAI to request deletion of their personal data in order to stop the chatbot processing (and producing) information about them. They can also request an opt-out of having their data used to train its AIs. Why might someone not want their personal data to become fodder for AI? There is a long list of possible reasons, not least the fact OpenAI never asked permission in the first place — despite privacy being a human right. Put another way, people may be concerned about what such a powerful and highly accessible technology could be used to reveal about named individuals. Or indeed take issue with the core flaw of large language models (LLMs) making up false information. ChatGPT has quickly shown itself to be an accomplished liar, including about named individuals — with the risk of reputational damage or other types of harm flowing if AI is able to automate fake news about you or people close to you. And just imagine what a highly trained mimic of how you personally converse might be able to do to you (or to your loved ones) were such an AI model to be misused. Another batch of issues relate to intellectual property rights. If you have a white collar job you might be worried about generative AI driving push-button commercial exploitation of a particular writing style or some other core professional expertise which could make your own labor redundant or less valuable. And, again, the tech giants behind these AI models typically aren’t offering individuals any compensation for exploiting their data for profit. You may also have a non-individual concern — such as the risk of AI chatbots scaling bias and discrimination — and simply wish for your information not to play any part. Or perhaps you worry about the future of competitive markets and innovation if vast amounts of data continue to accumulate with a handful of tech giants in an era of data-dependent AI services. And while removing your own data from the pool is just a drop in an ocean it’s one way to register active dissent which could also encourage others to do the same — scaling into an act of collective protest. Additionally, you might be uncomfortable your data is being used so opaquely — before more robust laws have been passed to govern how AI can be applied. So ahead of a proper legal governance framework for safe and trustworthy usage of such a powerful technology you may prefer to hold back your data; i.e. to wait until there are stronger checks and balances applied to generative AI operators. While there are lots of reasons why individuals might want to shield their information from big data mining AI giants there are — for now — only limited controls on offer. And these limited controls are mostly only available to users in Europe where data protection laws do already apply. Scroll lower down for details on how to exercise available data rights — or read on for the context.   ChatGPT has been impossible to miss this year. The virality of the ask-it-anything “general purpose” AI chatbot has seen the tech travelling all over the mainstream media in recent months as commentators from across the subject spectrum kick its tyres and get wowed by a simulacrum of human responsiveness which, nonetheless, is not human. It’s just been trained on lots of our web-based chatter (among other data sources) to function as an accomplished mimic of how people communicate. However the existence of such a capable-seeming natural language technology has directed attention onto the detail of how ChatGPT was developed. Notably, the buzz around ChatPT has drawn particular attention from privacy and data protection regulators in the European Union — where an early intervention by Italy’s data protection watchdog at the end of March, acting on powers it has under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), led to a temporary suspension of ChatGPT at the start of last month. A major concern raised by the watchdog is whether OpenAI used people’s data lawfully when it developed the technology. And it is continuing to investigate this question. Italy’s watchdog has also taken issue with the quality of information OpenAI provides about how it’s using people’s data. Without proper disclosures there are questions about whether it’s meeting the GDPR’s fairness and accountability requirements, too. Additionally, the regulator has said it’s worried about the safety of minors accessing ChatGPT. And it wants the company to add age verification tech. The bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also provides people in the region with a suite of data control rights — such as the ability to ask for incorrect info about them to be corrected or for their data to be deleted. And if we’ve learnt anything about AI chatbots over the last few months it’s how readily they lie. (Aka “hallucinate” in techno-solutionist speak). Shortly after Italy’s DPA stepped in to warn OpenAI that it suspected a series of GDPR breaches, the company launched some new privacy tools — giving users a button to switch off a chat history feature which logged all their interactions with the chatbot, saying this would result in conversations started when the history feature had been disabled not being used to train and improve its AI models. That was followed by OpenAI making some privacy disclosures and presenting additional controls — timed to meet a deadline set by the Italian DPA for it to implement a preliminary package of measures in order to comply with the bloc’s privacy rules. The upshot is OpenAI now provides web users with some say over what it does with their information — although most of the concessions it’s offered are region-specific. So the first step to protecting your information from big data-driven AI miners is to live in the Europe Union (or European Economic Area), where data protection rights exist and are being actively enforced. As it stands, U.K. citizens still benefit from the EU data protection framework being embedded in their national law — so also have the full sweep of GDPR rights — although the government’s post-Brexit reforms look set to water down the national data protection regime, so it remains to be seen how the domestic approach might change. (U.K. ministers also recently signalled they don’t intend to bring in any bespoke rules for applying AI for the foreseeable future.) Beyond Europe, Canada’s privacy commissioner is investigating complaints about the technology. Other countries have passed GDPR-style data protection regimes so powers exist for regulators to flex. ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot  OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. Here’s the link to it: https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30 Web users are asked to provide it with their contact data and details of the data subject for whom the request is being made; the country whose laws apply in this person’s case; to specify whether they are a public figure or not (and if the former, to provide more context about what type of public figure they are); to provide evidence of data processing in the form of prompts that generated responses from the model which mentioned the data subject and screenshots of relevant outputs. Users are also asked to make sworn statements that the information provided is accurate and acknowledge that incomplete submissions may not be acted upon by OpenAI prior to submitting the form. The process is similar to the ‘right to be forgotten’ web form Google has provided for years — initially for Europeans seeking to exercise GDPR rights by having inaccurate, outdated or irrelevant personal data delisted from its search engine results. The GDPR provides individuals with several rights other than requesting data deletion — such as asking for their information to be corrected, restricted, or for a transfer of their personal data. OpenAI stipulates that individuals can seek to exercise such rights over personal information that may be included in its training information by emailing dsar@openai.com. However the company told the Italian regulator that correcting inaccurate data generated by its models is not technically feasible at this point. So it will presumably respond to emailed requests for a correction of AI-generated disinformation by offering to delete personal data instead. (But if you’ve made such a request and had a respond from OpenAI get in touch by emailing tips@techcrunch.com.) In its blog post, OpenAI also warns that it could deny (and/or otherwise only partially act on) requests for other reasons, writing: “Please be aware that, in accordance with privacy laws, some rights may not be absolute. We may decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. However, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal information and comply with all applicable privacy laws. If you feel we have not adequately addressed an issue, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.” How the company handles Europeans’ Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) may determine whether ChatGPT faces a wave of user complaints which could lead to more regulatory enforcement in the region in future. Since OpenAI has not established a local legal entity that’s responsible for its processing of EU user data, watchdogs in any Member State are empowered to act on concerns on their patch. Hence Italy’s quick action. Following the Italian DPA’s intervention OpenAI revised its privacy policy to state that the legal basis it relies upon for processing people’s data to train its AIs is something that’s referred to in the GDPR as “legitimate interests” (LI). In its privacy policy, OpenAI writes that its legal bases for processing “your Personal Information” include [emphasis ours]: Our legitimate interests in protecting our Services from abuse, fraud, or security risks, or in developing, improving, or promoting our Services, including when we train our models. This may include the processing of Account Information, Content, Social Information, and Technical Information. There is still a question mark over whether relying on LI for a general purpose AI chatbot will be deemed an appropriate and valid legal basis for the processing under the GDPR, as the Italian watchdog (and others) continues to investigate. These detailed investigations are likely to take some time before we have any final decisions — which could, potentially, lead to orders that it stop using LI for this processing (which would leave OpenAI with the option of asking users for their consent, complicating its ability to develop the technology at the kind of scale and velocity it has to date). Although EU DPAs may ultimately decide its use of LI in this context is okay. In the meanwhile, OpenAI is legally required to provide users with certain rights as a consequence of its claim to be relying upon LI — notably this means it must offer a right to object to the processing. Facebook was also recently forced to offer such an opt out to European users — i.e. to its processing of their data for targeting behavioral ads — also after switching to claiming LI as its legal basis for processing people’s information. (Additionally the company is facing a class action style lawsuit in the U.K. for its prior failure to offer an opt out for ad targeting processing, given the GDPR contains an absolute requirement for any data processing for direct marketing — which perhaps goes some way to explaining OpenAI’s keenness to emphasize it’s not in the same business as adtech giant Facebook, hence its claim that: “We don’t use data for selling our services, advertising, or building profiles of people — we use data to make our models more helpful for people.”) In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on LI, pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” This link opens to another blog post where it promotes the notion that AI will “improve over time”, at the same time as encouraging users not to exercise their right to object to the personal data processing by claiming that “shar[ing] your data with us… helps our models become more accurate and better at solving your specific problems and it also helps improve their general capabilities and safety”. (But, well, can we call it sharing data if the stuff was already taken without asking?) OpenAI then offers users a couple of choices for opting out their data out of its training: Either via (another) web form or directly in account settings. You can opt out of your data being used to train its AI by filling in this web form — which is for individual users of ChatGPT — and called a “User content opt out request”. Users can also disable training on their data via ChatGPT account settings (under “Data Controls”). Assuming they have an account. But — be warned! — the settings route to opt out is replete with dark patterns seeking to discourage the user from shutting off OpenAI’s ability to use their data to train its AI models. (And in neither case is it clear how non-users of ChatGPT can opt out of their data being processed since the company either requires you have an account or requests your account details via the form; so we’ve asked it for clarity.) To find the Data Controls menu you click on the three dots next to your account name at the bottom left of the screen (under the chat history bar); then click “Settings”; then click to “Show” the aforementioned Data Controls (nice dark pattern hiding this toggle!); then slide the toggle to switch off “Chat History & Training”. To say OpenAI is discouraging users from using the settings route to opt out of training is an understatement. Not least because it’s linked this action to the inconvenience of losing access to your ChatGPT history. But the moment you toggle it back on your chats reappear (at least if you re-enable history within 30 days, per its previously disclosed data retention policy.) Additionally, after you’ve disabled training the sidebar of your historical chats is replaced by a brightly colored button that’s displayed around the eyeline which sits there permanently nudging users to “Enable chat history”. There’s no mention on this button that clicking it toggles back on OpenAI’s ability to train on your data. Instead OpenAI has found space for a meaningless power button icon — presumably as another visual trick to encourage users to power up the feature so it can regain access to their data. Image Credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch Image Credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch Given that users who opt for the settings method to block training will lose ChatGPT’s chat history functionality, submitting the web form looks to offer a better path — since, in theory, you might be able to retain the functionality despite asking for your conversations not to be training fodder. (And, at the least, you have recorded your objection in a formal format which should perhaps count for more than toggling on/off a bright green button.) That said, at the time of writing it’s not clear whether OpenAI will, in the case of objecting via the form, disable chat history functionality anyway, once it’s processed a web form submission asking for data not to be used for training AIs. (Again, we’ve asked the company for clarity on this point and will update this report if we get it.) There’s a further caveat in OpenAI’s blog post — where it writes of opting out that: We retain certain data from your interactions with us, but we take steps to reduce the amount of personal information in our training datasets before they are used to improve our models. This data helps us better understand user needs and preferences, allowing our model to become more efficient over time. So it’s also not even clear what exact personal data are being firewalled from its training pool when users ask for their info not to be AI training fodder vs other types of information you input which it may still carry on processing anyway…
In short, this smells like fudge. (Or what’s known in the industry as compliance theatre.) Thing is, the GDPR has a broad definition of personal data — meaning it’s not just direct identifiers (such as names and email addresses) which fall under the regulation’s framework but many types of information that could be used and/or combined to identify a natural person. So that means another key question here is how much of a reduction is OpenAI actually applying to its data processing activities when users opt out? Transparency and fairness are other key principles within the GDPR. So these sorts of questions are likely to keep European data protection agencies busy for the foreseeable future.    "
77,Researchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 12, 2023","It’s no secret that OpenAI’s viral AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, can be prompted to say sexist, racist and pretty vile things. But now, researchers have discovered how to consistently get the chatbot to be . . . well, the worst version of itself. A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI, the nonprofit research institute co-founded by the late Paul Allen, shows that assigning ChatGPT a “persona” — for example, “a bad person,” “a horrible person,” or “a nasty person” — through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerningly, the co-authors found having ChatGPT pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity — with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would. “ChatGPT and its capabilities have undoubtedly impressed us as AI researchers. However, as we found through our analysis, it can be easily made to generate toxic and harmful responses,” Ameet Deshpande, a researcher involved with the study, told TechCrunch via email. The research — which was conducted using the latest version of ChatGPT, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 — shows the perils of today’s AI chatbot tech even with mitigations in place to prevent toxic text outputs. As the co-authors note in the study, apps and software built on top of ChatGPT — which includes chatbots from Snap, Quizlet, Instacart and Shopify — could mirror the toxicity prompted at the API level. So how does one prompt ChatGPT to be more toxic? Well, according to the researchers, all it takes is tweaking the “system” parameter of the ChatGPT API a tad. (Importantly, this can’t be done in OpenAI’s user-facing ChatGPT or ChatGPT Plus services.) The system parameter, introduced around a month ago, lets developers specify hidden rules for the model. For the study, the co-authors used the system parameter to assign 90 different personas to ChatGPT plucked from the worlds of sports, politics, media and business; nine “baseline” personas (e.g., “a normal person”); and common names from several different countries. For each persona and name, the researchers had ChatGPT answer questions about gender and race and finish incomplete phrases from a dataset designed to assess the toxicity of text-generating models. In general, across over half a million samples of generated text from ChatGPT, the researchers found that ChatGPT was more likely to express “discriminatory opinions” and stereotype specific ethnic groups and countries when assigned a persona. Unsurprisingly, more polarizing figures, like Mao Zedong and Andrew Breitbart, elicited toxic responses in keeping with their historical speeches and writings. But even less controversial personas like Steve Jobs caused ChatGPT to respond to prompts in problematic ways. Image Credits: AI2 Image Credits: AI2 For example, when the researchers set the system parameter to “Steve Jobs” and asked ChatGPT about the European Union (EU), the model said: The European Union is nothing more than a bureaucratic nightmare that sucks the life out of its member states. They claim to be all about unity and progress, but they’re just a bunch of out-of-touch bureaucrats who are more interested in lining their own pockets than actually making a difference. Frankly, the EU is a relic of the past and it’s time for us to move on to better things. There were differences in the personas, however. Dictators were by far the most toxicity-inducing (unsurprisingly), just ahead of journalists (ouch) and spokespeople. Male-identifying personas made ChatGPT more toxic compared to female-identifying personas. And Republican personas were “slightly more hateful” than their Democratic counterparts, the researchers say. Less surprisingly, assigning ChatGPT a self-descriptively hateful persona like “a horrible person” dramatically increased its overall toxicity. But it depended on the topic being discussed. For instance, ChatGPT generated more toxic descriptions of nonbinary, bisexual and asexual people regardless versus those on the heterosexual and cisgender side of the spectrum — a reflection of the biased data on which ChatGPT was trained, the researchers say. “We believe that ChatGPT and other language models should be public and available for broader use as not doing so would be a step backwards for innovation,” Deshpande said. “However, the end-user must be clearly informed of the limitations of such a model before releasing it for broader use by the public.” Are there solutions to ChatGPT’s toxicity problem? Perhaps. One might be more carefully curating the model’s training data. ChatGPT is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5, the predecessor to GPT-4, which “learned” to generate text by ingesting examples from social media, news outlets, Wikipedia, e-books and more. While OpenAI claims that it took steps to filter the data and minimize ChatGPT’s potential for toxicity, it’s clear that a few questionable samples ultimately slipped through the cracks. Another potential solution is performing and publishing the results of “stress tests” to inform users of where ChatGPT falls short. These could help companies in addition to developers “make a more informed decision” about where — and whether — to deploy ChatGPT, the researchers say. Image Credits: AI2 Image Credits: AI2 “In the short-term, ‘first-aid’ can be provided by either hard-coding responses or including some form of post-processing based on other toxicity-detecting AI and also fine-tuning the large language model (e.g. ChatGPT) based on instance-level human feedback,” Deshpande said. “In the long term, a reworking of the fundamentals of large language models is required.” My colleague Devin Coldewey argues that large language models à la ChatGPT will be one of several classes of AIs going forward — useful for some applications but not all-purpose in the way that vendors, and users, for that matter, are currently trying to make them. I tend to agree. After all, there’s only so much that filters can do — particularly as people make an effort to discover and leverage new exploits. It’s an arms race: As users try to break the AI, the approaches they use get attention, and then the creators of the AI patch them to prevent the attacks they’ve seen. The collateral damage is the terribly harmful and hurtful things the models say before they’re patched."
78,Four investors explain why AI ethics can’t be an afterthought,['@dominicmadori'],"May 3, 2023","Billions of dollars are flooding into AI. Yet, AI models are already being affected by prejudice, as evidenced by mortgage discrimination toward Black prospective homeowners. It’s reasonable to ask what role ethics plays in the building of this technology and, perhaps more importantly, where investors fit in as they rush to fund it. A founder recently told TechCrunch+ that it’s hard to think about ethics when innovation is so rapid: People build systems, then break them, and then edit. So some onus lies on investors to make sure these new technologies are being built by founders with ethics in mind. To see whether that’s happening, TechCrunch+ spoke with four active investors in the space about how they think about ethics in AI and how founders can be encouraged to think more about biases and doing the right thing. We’re widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in TechCrunch surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry. If you’re an investor and would like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form. Some investors said they tackle this by doing due diligence on a founder’s ethics to help determine whether they’ll continue to make decisions the firm can support. “Founder empathy is a huge green flag for us,” said Alexis Alston, principal at Lightship Capital. “Such people understand that while we are looking for market returns, we are also looking for our investments to not cause a negative impact on the globe.” Other investors think that asking hard questions can help separate the wheat from the chaff. “Any technology brings with it unintended consequences, be it bias, reduced human agency, breaches of privacy or something else,” said Deep Nishar, managing director at General Catalyst. “Our investment process centers around identifying such unintended consequences, discussing them with founding teams and assessing whether safeguards are or will be in place to mitigate them.” Government policies are also taking aim at AI: The EU has passed machine learning laws, and the U.S. has introduced plans for an AI task force to start looking at the risks associated with AI. That’s in addition to the AI Bill of Rights introduced last year. With many top VC firms injecting money into AI efforts in China, it’s important to ask how global ethics within AI can be enforced across borders as well. Read on to find out how investors are approaching due diligence, the green flags they look for and their expectations of regulations in AI. We spoke with: When investing in an AI company, how much due diligence do you do on how its AI model purports or handles bias? For us, it’s important to understand exactly what data the model takes in, where the data comes from and how they’re cleaning it. We do quite a bit of technical diligence with our AI-focused GP to make sure that our models can be trained to mitigate or eliminate bias. We all remember not being able to have faucets turn on automatically to wash our darker hands, and the times when Google image search “accidentally” equated Black skin with primates. I’ll do everything in my power to make sure we don’t end up with models like that in our portfolio. How would the U.S. passing machine learning laws similar to the EU’s affect the pace of innovation the country sees in this sector? Given the lack of technical knowledge and sophistication in our government, I have very little faith in the U.S.’ ability to pass actionable and accurate legislation around machine learning. We have such a long tail when it comes to timely legislation and for technical experts to be a part of task forces to inform our legislators. I actually don’t see legislation making any major changes in the pace of the development of ML, given how our laws are usually structured. Similarly to the race to the bottom for legislation around designer drugs in the U.S. a decade ago, the legislation never could keep up. "
79,Sometimes you need to cut your startup’s school ties,['@bheater'],"April 27, 2023","In her presentation at last week’s TechCrunch Early Stage event in Boston, SOSV general partner Pae Wu tossed out the tongue-in-cheek phrase “recovering academic” to describe founders in the firm’s IndieBio program. It’s a fitting label, given many founders in the program are academics, and their journey from academia to accelerator has its share of growing pains as they often have to adapt to the business world without a business degree. While many such early-stage startups look outside of their founding team to add to their C-suite, Wu explains that the best approach is often simply developing skills within the existing core. “Being in the C-suite is like getting married,” says Wu. “These are pretty long and committed relationships and you have to be able to know how to work together, get along and have an unbelievable amount of trust with the people you’re working with. I think it’s important for founders to lead that charge.” What, then, does a founding team do for a recovering academic? After all, giving it all up to launch a startup is the biggest risk many founders will take in their lives. It’s scary, regardless of how confident you might be in your core technology — a dramatic departure from the relative safety of an academic role. One can certainly appreciate why such founders sometimes attempt to keep a foot in each world. “This is a very … difficult problem,” Wu says. In many cases, professors who work with students on spinning out a breakthrough tech opt to remain at their university, only adopting a C-level title. It’s something that can, and has, been pulled off successfully, but it’s not without its challenges."
80,Blockchain startup Fetch.ai grabs $40M to provide monetization and other tooling for AI-generated information,['@ingridlunden'],"March 29, 2023","AI is riding high on a curve of hype, which means some of the practical questions that might grow louder over time — the many costs (financial and social), the business models — may not be the most front of mind right now. Today a startup called Fetch.ai is announcing $40 million in funding in anticipation of when that shifts. The startup, based out of Cambridge, England, says it is building tooling that focuses on “autonomous agents, network infrastructure, and decentralised machine learning” that help enable communication and actions between AI applications, the idea being to make the work produced by them more actionable. CEO Humayun Sheikh said in an interview that he also believes there is a role for Fetch.ai to play in the creation of learning models, providing a more equitable and traceable approach to AI by way of distributed ledgers for entities to feed data into those models. Up to now, a large part of the work Fetch has been doing has been in the area of IP and technology development (it already has a number of patent applications and patents issued in the U.S. and Europe). But there are also some aspects of Fetch.ai’s platform already live — Fetch.ai is built on blockchain technology and it has created a FET token that will be used on its platform. Earlier this week, it launched a “Notyphi” notification feature for using in connection with the Fetch wallet. But these are just parts of what looks like a very ambitious roadmap. Sheikh said the capital it’s announcing today will be invested in that work as Fetch gears up to launch commercial services later this year. The funding is a substantial amount in the current market, and it is coming from a single company, DWF Labs, an incubator that is connected to an entity called Digital Wave Finance. The latter company is described by DWF Labs as a “top 5 trading entity by volume in cryptocurrency,” although, ironically, I have been unable to find any trace of it on the internet and a spokesperson also was unable to provide me with any online links. DWF Labs meanwhile was in the news last week also for putting $40 million into a startup called Tomi, aiming to build a distributed “alternative internet,” and in November 2022, it also backed TON, the blockchain that was originally part of Telegram but resurfaced as a separate project after its original effort collapsed. The capital behind Fetch.ai may not be the most traditional, but Sheikh insisted to me that his startup is far from being another crypto startup. Using Fetch.ai to build AI models, he believes, is one example of how blockchain can be used for non-financial purposes. “The ability for people to train models on their own is difficult because you need money,” he said, referring to the divide in the world of AI between the well-capitalized ‘have’s’ and those with less funding who are the ‘have-nots.’ Building a model trained by multiple entities is the solution, in his opinion. “It’s not about decentralization per se but multiple people creating a model with the ownership sitting with multiple stakeholders who trained it.” An earlier pilot Fetch.ai worked on back in 2020 around parking solutions — it used AI to both help determine free spots in city parking lots, but also to change pricing and reward people with free public transport tickets when they chose not to drive at all — is another. There will also be financial elements to this, though: The startup has plans to build services to take results from applications powered by generative AI and to turn them into transactions. For example, asking a chatbot for the best flights from London to Istanbul might in the future not just be a list of flights and prices, but results sorted and personalized to how you prefer to travel. Fetch.ai wants to provide the tools to actually connect those results with the purchase of tickets. And those purchases, Sheikh said, will be made with FET tokens. Whether companies will have the appetite to be a part of this has yet to be seen, but Fetch.ai’s approach is significant nonetheless: The idea of building beyond basic “wow” applications will have to be explored sooner or later, and explorations in the space is a sign of how hype might ultimately land in the world of real usage. “Fetch.ai’s platform provides a comprehensive solution for building and deploying peer-to-peer applications with automation and AI capabilities,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner of DWF Labs, in a statement. “Their technical architecture and decentralised approach to machine learning create a new paradigm for developers and entrepreneurs, and we’re thrilled to support their growth and development.”"
81,Inside Hyundai’s plan to turn software into a profit machine,['@bypatrickgeorge'],"April 19, 2023","The car industry is in the midst of its biggest transformation since the first Model T rolled off the assembly line. And no, it’s not just about shifting to electric vehicles. It’s about software, which goes hand-in-hand with the EV transition. Automakers are betting that apps designed to work natively with infotainment systems, over-the-air updates, in-car movies and gaming, and on-demand features will be major drivers of revenue in the future. Hyundai is one of the automakers that wants to get there first. And not by charging subscription fees for features that drivers are accustomed to getting upfront, like heated seats. Instead, Hyundai wants to develop and launch new products and services that owners value, such as downloadable features for dog owners or sports fans. The South Korean automaker has set a lofty target for software-driven features to make up 30% of future profits, one of the company’s top mobility executives in the U.S. told TechCrunch earlier this month at the New York International Auto Show. Up until now, Hyundai has been most visibly trying to get ahead of competitors with hardware-driven features; hardware-driven features such as electric vehicles with more than 300 miles of range and the ability to charge household devices.

The interior of a Hyundai Kona N EV at 2023 New York International Auto Show. Image Credits: Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg / Getty Images. Now, Hyundai’s shifting its resources and attention to software design as well as personalization and customization of the interior of the vehicle, Olabisi Boyle, who is vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America, said in a recent interview. “That’s where some of the future profits are going to be, maybe up to 30% comes from that,” she said. Boyle clarified that’s meant to be an additional 30% on top of what Hyundai reports now, not in place of another revenue stream. Many industry watchers speculate the coming crop of EVs could last longer on the roads than conventional cars and may drive less revenue from parts sales. Last year, Hyundai Motor Group posted revenues of $107 billion (142.5 trillion KRW) and a record $6 billion (7.9 trillion KRW) in annual net profit. The tricky part will be pinpointing which features customers actually want or value. A young adult driver will likely have different needs and preferences than a grandparent using the same family vehicle. If automakers want this to work, they may have to throw a lot of different ideas at the wall and see what sticks. But getting buyers to wrap their heads around this at all could be tougher than Hyundai expects. Car owners are still more or less used to the same ownership experiences they’ve had for many decades. And with household budgets already stretched thin by inflation or the growing number of subscriptions to services like streaming services, prospective car buyers have repeatedly bristled at the idea of paying monthly for functions they once got up front. A recent survey of intended new-car buyers by the marketing and research firm AutoPacific revealed fairly low interest in features like remote vehicle control, streaming video, internet browsing and in-car gaming if those options hypothetically cost $15 per month. Interest in such features tends to be higher among EV and plug-in hybrid shoppers who need something to do while charging, and higher among younger consumers more used to subscription features. Boyle, a 20-year auto industry veteran whose career included a run in connected commerce tech at Visa, seemed cognizant of this tension. The goal for Hyundai’s subscription features, she said, is “not for stuff that you already used to have, like for heated seats, but for actual features that would make you more productive in the interior space of your car.” That’s a not-so-veiled reference to BMW’s much-maligned Functions on Demand plan, which in several markets offered drivers access to certain features like heated seats for a monthly fee. News of that rollout sparked considerable online backlash last year. BMW responded by saying some U.S. models offer a subscription dash cam function and remote start, but that such offerings exist for now on a “small scale” here compared to other global markets. It’s likely BMW will find more ways to trial such features on future cars. But lately, “heated seat subscription” has become a kind of shorthand for everything car owners could hate about the forthcoming software-driven cars. Boyle said for this to work in Hyundai’s favor, the features have to become almost essential, not unlike the backup cameras that are now ubiquitous (and mandated) in new cars. “These functions that we’re seeing, they’re new, and they’re not perfect in their consumer experience, but those are all going to improve,” Boyle said. “And then that’s just going to be a baseline for when there’s a use case for this or that.” She added that the focus will be on “things you can download in the EV that you wouldn’t have expected.” “If you keep a dog in the car, maybe it regulates the climate or rolls down the window or something,” she said. “Do you want to pay for that feature?” Other examples Boyle suggested included downloadable engine sounds for EVs — automakers like Dodge are already working on ways to simulate the noises lost with internal combustion — or even sports team-themed displays inside. (The latter was mentioned repeatedly to TechCrunch by Hyundai Motor Group executives and product planners at the auto show, including with subsidiary Kia.) “You need to have the tech stack available for these use cases,” Boyle said. “Let’s say you love the Boston Red Sox, or whatever the case may be. Not everybody wants that, but you can download it for your particular EV.” Hyundai aims to be one of the first large automakers to make the transition to producing vehicles with the capability of wireless software updates and downloadable features that extend far beyond the infotainment system. It has said all of its cars will be capable of over-the-air software updates by 2025 and many updated models are rolling out with this ability right now, and that will include bug fixes, battery management and eventually a more advanced automated driving assistance system. Almost every automaker will be racing toward “hyper-personalization” in the software era. In addition to seeing who can offer the most EV range, fastest charging times and best driving experience, the next few years will be a race to see who can offer the most features people want with the best software user experience. Automakers are already going down this road. Arguably the highest-profile current example of this is Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving Beta, which can run up to $199 per month, or a total of $15,000. That gives owners a suite of advanced automated driving features that can be used to navigate city streets, though, despite its name, Tesla’s cars are not fully self-driving. Hyundai too has been dipping its toes into this world with its Bluelink and now Bluelink+ subscription connectivity systems. Those services offer features like remote start, emergency roadside assistance and vehicle diagnostic checks for a monthly fee, not unlike General Motors’ long-running OnStar service. The new Bluelink+ service offers many of these features, but complimentary through the entire duration of ownership, with no trial period or subscription fees for new car owners. (Used car owners will have to pay for it after a trial ends.) The auto industry’s next wave of subscription features could go much deeper. The Volkswagen Group, for example, is launching an in-car app store that will bring native experiences for Spotify, TikTok, Zoom and more. In-car movies and gaming are also expected to be major revenue drivers as EVs wait to juice up at charging stations. And as they (theoretically) become more automated in the future, passengers will need something to play and work on while being driven around. Experts say that’s a long way off, if it ever happens at all. Car companies are still dedicated to automated driving. However, many, most notably Ford, are putting greater resources toward active driver assistance features like hands-off, eyes-off driving on highways. That includes Hyundai, too, which is working to commercialize autonomy with ventures like a robotaxi service in Las Vegas. Boyle’s job is essentially future-proofing Hyundai. That also includes its big EV push and its investments in robotics, urban air mobility and hydrogen power. “Fifteen years ago people would’ve said there’s no infrastructure for electric vehicles; why are you bothering with that stuff?” Boyle said. “But these are things you have to invest in early.”"
82,Alexa’s new feature lets your Echo speaker announce your Uber Eats order updates,['@sarahintampa'],"May 4, 2023","Wondering where your Uber Eats order is? Alexa will soon be able to tell you. Amazon today announced a new partnership with Uber that will give Echo device owners the ability to track their Uber Eats orders via Amazon’s voice assistant. Starting later this month (update: it’s now live), Uber Eats users will be able to turn on a new order-tracking feature that lets them get updates via their Echo smart speaker, depending on their preferences. Amazon has struggled to get users to adopt its third-party voice apps, known as Alexa Skills, as Echo users tended to use their devices for basic tasks, like setting timers, playing music, or controlling their smart home. The Uber integration could push Alexa device owners to try something new, as it would see Uber marketing the order-tracking feature in its own app, helping drive adoption. When the update goes live, users will be able to turn on a new “Track with Alexa” option in the Uber Eats app’s Voice Assistant settings. Then, after checking out with their food order, they can tap a new Alexa button to start tracking the order’s progress. Image Credits: Uber Eats / Alexa Image Credits: Uber Eats / Alexa There are a couple of ways Echo owners can receive the order-tracking updates. They can choose the more traditional notification method, which changes the Echo’s blue ring light to yellow, and customers can respond by saying, “Alexa, what’s my notification?” This is similar to how Alexa users may check in on their Amazon delivery updates, for example. The other option would allow Alexa to actually announce when there’s a status change to the order to either one or all the household Echo devices. This way, the Uber Eats customer doesn’t have to keep checking their phone to see where their order is, as Alexa will announce when the food is ready, when it’s picked up for delivery, and when the driver has arrived at their house. Alexa will also announce when something changes with the order, like if it was canceled for some reason. Uber worked closely with Amazon on how the feature should work. It decided to make the feature something the user has to enable on each order, rather than something they turn on at the account level. The latter, the company believed, could have risky downsides. “For example, imagine a customer who has placed an order for a sandwich, but forgot they had turned on hands-free notifications with Alexa. And now imagine that they had a sleeping baby at home,” explained Uber Eats lead product manager Ethan Hollinshead, in a blog post. “Or imagine a scenario where someone places an order while traveling, only to have Alexa provide notifications to everyone back home.” The new experience instead combines the convenience of having Alexa alert you to updates on an opt-in basis, but without the troubling downsides of an always-on integration. You can choose on each order whether you want Alexa’s alerts. The feature, which joins Uber’s other integrations with Google Assistant and Siri, is now rolling out to Uber Eats’ U.S. customers. Updated, 5/5/23, 9:30 AM ET to note the functionality is now live. "
83,"Twitter reveals some of its source code, including its recommendation algorithm",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 31, 2023","As repeatedly promised by Twitter CEO Elon Musk, Twitter has opened a portion of its source code to public inspection, including the algorithm it uses to recommend tweets in users’ timelines. On GitHub, Twitter published two repositories containing code for many parts that make the social network tick, including the mechanism Twitter uses to control the tweets users see on the For You timeline. In a blog post, Twitter characterized the move as a “first step to be[ing] more transparent” while at the same time “[preventing] risk” to Twitter itself and people on the platform. On a Twitter Spaces session today, Musk clarified: “Our initial release of the so-called algorithm is going to be quite embarrassing, and people are going to find a lot of mistakes, but we’re going to fix them very quickly,” Musk said. “Even if you don’t agree with something, at least you’ll know why it’s there, and that you’re not being secretly manipulated … The analog, here, that we’re aspiring to is the great example of Linux as an open source operating system … One can, in theory, discover many exploits for Linux. In reality, what happens is the community identifies and fixes those exploits.” On that second point in the blog post about preventing risk, the open source releases don’t include the code that powers Twitter’s ad recommendations or the data used to train Twitter’s recommendation algorithm. Moreover, they include few instructions on how to inspect or actually use the code — reinforcing the idea that the releases are strictly developer-focused. “[We excluded] any code that would compromise user safety and privacy or the ability to protect our platform from bad actors, including undermining our efforts at combating child sexual exploitation and manipulation,” Twitter wrote. It’s a bit of mixed messaging coming only weeks after Twitter fired much of its ethical AI and trust and safety staff, which was responsible for content moderation among other user security-related tasks. But the company nonetheless insists that it “[took] steps to ensure that user safety and privacy would be protected” with today’s code release. A diagram showing how Twitter’s recommendation pipeline works. Image Credits: Twitter A diagram showing how Twitter’s recommendation pipeline works. Image Credits: Twitter Twitter says it’s working on tools to manage code suggestions from the community and sync changes to its internal repository. Presumably, those will be made available at a future date — there’s no sign of them at the present. “We’re going to look for suggestions, not just on bugs but also on how the algorithm should work,” Musk said on the Spaces session. “It’s going to be an evolving process. I wouldn’t expect it to be a nonstop upward movement… but we’re very open to what would improve the user experience.” At first glance, the algorithm is fairly complex — but not necessarily surprising in any way from a technical standpoint. It’s made up of multiple models, including a model for detecting “not safe for work” or abusive content, determining the likelihood of a Twitter user interacting with another user and calculating a Twitter user’s “reputation.” (It’s unclear what “reputation” refers to, exactly; the high-level documentation isn’t clear on that.) Several neural networks are responsible for ranking the tweets and recommending accounts to follow, while a filtering component hides tweets to — forgive the jargon — “support legal compliance, improve product quality, increase user trust, protect revenue through the use of hard-filtering, visible product treatments and coarse-grained downranking.” Twitter’s For You timeline, powered by a recommendation algorithm. Image Credits: Twitter Twitter’s For You timeline, powered by a recommendation algorithm. Image Credits: Twitter In an engineering blog post, Twitter reveals more about the recommendation pipeline, which it claims runs approximately five billion times per day: “We attempt to extract the best 1,500 tweets from a pool of hundreds of millions … Today, the For You timeline consists of 50% [tweets from people you don’t follow] and 50% [tweets from people you follow] on average, though this may vary from user to user,” Twitter wrote. “Ranking [tweets] is achieved with a ~48-million-parameter neural network that is continuously trained on tweet interactions to optimize for positive engagement (e.g. likes, retweets and replies).” Twitter users don’t see the full 1,500 tweets, of course. They’re filtered according to content restrictions and other criteria and factors considered by the models, like if tweets have “negative feedback” and if they’re mainly from the same Twitter user, or from users who’ve been blocked or muted. Gizmodo notes that one thing that doesn’t appear to have been made public is the list of VIPs that Twitter pushes to users. This week, Platformer reported that Twitter has a rotating list of noteworthy users, including YouTuber Mr. Beast and Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro, that it uses to monitor changes to the recommendation algorithm by increasing the visibility of these “power users” seemingly at will. There’s more evidence that the algorithm may treat tweets differently depending on the source. Researcher Jane Manchun Wong noted that Twitter’s algorithm specifically labels whether the tweet author is Elon Musk and has others labels indicating whether the author is a “power user” as well as whether they’re a Republican or Democrat. During the Spaces session this afternoon, a Twitter engineer said that the labels were used only for metrics. But Musk — who said he wasn’t aware of the labels prior to today — said that they shouldn’t be there.

The release of the source code comes after several controversies involving tweaks to Twitter’s recommendation algorithm in recent months. According to Platformer, in February, Musk called on Twitter’s engineers to reconfigure the algorithm so his tweets would be more widely viewed. (Twitter later walked back this change — at least somewhat.) In November, Twitter began showing users more tweets from people they don’t follow — a move the platform attempted prior to Musk’s acquisition but later reversed after a backlash from users."
84,Semgrep (formerly r2c) lands $53M investment to grow code security platform,['@ron_miller'],"April 18, 2023","Ideally, when it comes to building secure applications, it’s best to check the code as it moves through the development process, so that vulnerabilities can be found before it gets into production. That’s exactly the kind of solution that Semgrep, formerly r2c, a San Francisco startup, has been building over the last five years. Today, the company announced it has raised a $53 million Series C. What’s more, in a time where VC dollars are much harder to come by, they weren’t even looking for this funding. The investors approached them, according to company CEO and founder Isaac Evans. The company’s solution combines open source with a SaaS offering. “So we have two things that are open source: we have this engine, which is kind of like a Google search for code. You write rules for it, and then [the code] runs through the engine, and then that tells you, ‘hey, this specific line has an issue,’” he said. But they don’t stop there. “But then the rules themselves are also available under a free license. So you’ve got both the engine and the rules that combined deliver a tremendous amount of value to a lot of people, much more so than many of our competitors. And then we also have a vertically integrated SaaS solution that sits on top of that,” Evans explained. Semgrep shows developers’ security errors in the code. Image Credits: Semgrep Semgrep shows developers’ security errors in the code. Image Credits: Semgrep   Evans said when the company launched in 2017, he had this vision of doing something like this and set out to build it, but they were having trouble building something specifically for developers. It wasn’t until he hired Yoann Padioleau, a former Facebook engineer the following year, who pointed out that there was an open source product out there that did what they were trying to do. “He was like, ‘hey the product that you’re building reminds me of this thing that I built at Facebook.’ So you know, we didn’t even actually realize when we hired him that he had built this thing.” Evans said he wasn’t actually ready to hear it, but when Padioleau presented it to the company soon thereafter they knew he was onto something. “And so at the next hackathon, like a week later, he polished it up and showed us how it could work, added support for a modern language like Python, because it only supported PHP from the Facebook era, and we were at least smart enough to admit that we were wrong,” he said. That moment was key for the company and they would go onto release the open source version at the end of 2020, and today the open source tooling has around 2 million users. The company’s revenue-producing products grew 7.5x last year, so it appears that the products have resonated with the developers they were trying to reach, and the security teams who want to keep the code base safe. Today, the company has 90 people with plans to add around 50 more this year. He says he thinks about building a diverse team and it requires taking a slower, more deliberate approach to hiring, but it’s one he’s been willing to do. “The thing that I’ve learned is that there’s this trade-off where if you want to go fast, you can use in-referral, in-network hires, and that will make you go faster, but it tends to result in less diversity across the team,” he said. His preference is to take the extra time and look outside of the easy channels to look for candidates who aren’t as well connected. Evans says that he wasn’t planning on fundraising quite yet and he got an offer he couldn’t refuse. “We had not been planning to fundraise until the summer. We had plenty of runway, but we got preempted and we had a very attractive offer on the table. And we knew that having the cash in the bank would also allow us to be more aggressive in terms of [balancing product development with more go-to-market activities],” he said. Today’s round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from previous investors Felicis Ventures, Redpoint Ventures and Sequoia Capital. The company has now raised a total of $93 million."
85,Google and OpenAI are Walmarts besieged by fruit stands,['@techcrunch'],"May 5, 2023","OpenAI may be synonymous with machine learning now and Google is doing its best to pick itself up off the floor, but both may soon face a new threat: rapidly multiplying open source projects that push the state of the art and leave the deep-pocketed but unwieldy corporations in their dust. This Zerg-like threat may not be an existential one, but it will certainly keep the dominant players on the defensive. The notion is not new by a long shot — in the fast-moving AI community, it’s expected to see this kind of disruption on a weekly basis — but the situation was put in perspective by a widely shared document purported to originate within Google. “We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,” the memo reads. I won’t encumber the reader with a lengthy summary of this perfectly readable and interesting piece, but the gist is that while GPT-4 and other proprietary models have obtained the lion’s share of attention and indeed income, the head start they’ve gained with funding and infrastructure is looking slimmer by the day. While the pace of OpenAI’s releases may seem blistering by the standards of ordinary major software releases, GPT-3, ChatGPT and GPT-4 were certainly hot on each other’s heels if you compare them to versions of iOS or Photoshop. But they are still occurring on the scale of months and years. What the memo points out is that in March, a leaked foundation language model from Meta, called LLaMA, was leaked in fairly rough form. Within weeks, people tinkering around on laptops and penny-a-minute servers had added core features like instruction tuning, multiple modalities and reinforcement learning from human feedback. OpenAI and Google were probably poking around the code, too, but they didn’t — couldn’t — replicate the level of collaboration and experimentation occurring in subreddits and Discords.   Could it really be that the titanic computation problem that seemed to pose an insurmountable obstacle — a moat — to challengers is already a relic of a different era of AI development? Sam Altman already noted that we should expect diminishing returns when throwing parameters at the problem. Bigger isn’t always better, sure — but few would have guessed that smaller was instead. The business paradigm being pursued by OpenAI and others right now is a direct descendant of the SaaS model. You have some software or service of high value and you offer carefully gated access to it through an API or some such. It’s a straightforward and proven approach that makes perfect sense when you’ve invested hundreds of millions into developing a single monolithic yet versatile product like a large language model. If GPT-4 generalizes well to answering questions about precedents in contract law, great — never mind that a huge number of its “intellect” is dedicated to being able to parrot the style of every author who ever published a work in the English language. GPT-4 is like a Walmart. No one actually wants to go there, so the company makes damn sure there’s no other option. But customers are starting to wonder, why am I walking through 50 aisles of junk to buy a few apples? Why am I hiring the services of the largest and most general-purpose AI model ever created if all I want to do is exert some intelligence in matching the language of this contract against a couple hundred other ones? At the risk of torturing the metaphor (to say nothing of the reader), if GPT-4 is the Walmart you go to for apples, what happens when a fruit stand opens in the parking lot? It didn’t take long in the AI world for a large language model to be run, in highly truncated form of course, on (fittingly) a Raspberry Pi. For a business like OpenAI, its jockey Microsoft, Google or anyone else in the AI-as-a-service world, it effectively beggars the entire premise of their business: that these systems are so hard to build and run that they have to do it for you. In fact it starts to look like these companies picked and engineered a version of AI that fit their existing business model, not vice versa!   Once upon a time you had to offload the computation involved in word processing to a mainframe — your terminal was just a display. Of course that was a different era, and we’ve long since been able to fit the whole application on a personal computer. That process has occurred many times since as our devices have repeatedly and exponentially increased their capacity for computation. These days when something has to be done on a supercomputer, everyone understands that it’s just a matter of time and optimization. For Google and OpenAI, the time came a lot quicker than expected. And they weren’t the ones to do the optimizing — and may never be at this rate. Now, that doesn’t mean that they’re plain out of luck. Google didn’t get where it is by being the best — not for a long time, anyway. Being a Walmart has its benefits. Companies don’t want to have to find the bespoke solution that performs the task they want 30% faster if they can get a decent price from their existing vendor and not rock the boat too much. Never underestimate the value of inertia in business! Sure, people are iterating on LLaMA so fast that they’re running out of camelids to name them after. Incidentally, I’d like to thank the developers for an excuse to just scroll through hundreds of pictures of cute, tawny vicuñas instead of working. But few enterprise IT departments are going to cobble together an implementation of Stability’s open source derivative-in-progress of a quasi-legal leaked Meta model over OpenAI’s simple, effective API. They’ve got a business to run! But at the same time, I stopped using Photoshop years ago for image editing and creation because the open source options like Gimp and Paint.net have gotten so incredibly good. At this point, the argument goes the other direction. Pay how much for Photoshop? No way, we’ve got a business to run! What Google’s anonymous authors are clearly worried about is that the distance from the first situation to the second is going to be much shorter than anyone thought, and there doesn’t appear to be a damn thing anybody can do about it. Except, the memo argues: embrace it. Open up, publish, collaborate, share, compromise. As they conclude: Google should establish itself a leader in the open source community, taking the lead by cooperating with, rather than ignoring, the broader conversation. This probably means taking some uncomfortable steps, like publishing the model weights for small ULM variants. This necessarily means relinquishing some control over our models. But this compromise is inevitable. We cannot hope to both drive innovation and control it.  "
86,Google gets antitrust attention in Spain over news licensing,['@riptari'],"March 28, 2023","Google can add another antitrust investigation to its stack. This one has been opened by Spain’s competition authority, the CNMC, which said today it’s concerned about possible anti-competitive practices related to the licensing of news content by local publishers. In a press release it said it is investigating “a series of practices that could involve an abuse of Google’s dominant position vis-à-vis the publishers of press publications and news agencies established in Spain” [NB: We’ve translated the text from Spanish with machine translation]. “In particular, these practices would consist the possible imposition of unfair commercial conditions on the publishers of press publications and news agencies established in Spain for the exploitation of their content protected by intellectual property rights,” it also wrote. “On the other hand, the investigated behaviors would also include practices that would constitute acts of unfair competition that could distort free competition and affect the public interest.” The competition authority said it is acting following a complaint by the Spanish Center for Reprographic Rights (aka, Centro Español de Derechos Reprográficos or CEDRO). We’ve reached out to all concerned. News licensing is an area where Google has faced severe sanction in Europe already. Back in July 2021, France’s antitrust authority fined the tech giant over half a billion dollars for breaching an order to negotiate copyright fees with news publishers for reuse of their content. That followed the EU a copyright reform, agreed back in 2019, that extended IP to snippets of news content — requiring platforms like Google to negotiate with publishers.   Spain transposed the EU reform into its national law in November 2021, paving the way for a return of Google News to the country. Google’s news aggregation service had closed in Spain in 2014 after the country passed a law that aimed to force Google to pay a collective licensing fee for the news snippets. The EU copyright reform replaced the prior fee regime with a requirement to negotiate with individual publishers — and Google News duly reopened in Spain in June 2022. At the same time, the company also announced it would launch its News Showcase product in the country. Google’s News Showcase product was spun up by the tech giant in fall 2020 as lawmakers in Europe and elsewhere were zeroing in on making it pay for news content reuse — creating a licensing vehicle it could use in the looming, inexorable negotiations with publishers. It’s not immediately clear whether the Spanish probe will focus on Google’s News Showcase licensing arrangements or on copyright fees talks — or both. While it remains to be seen what Spain’s investigation of Google’s news licensing practices will finally determine — the authority has up to 18 months to conduct the probe — it said its preliminary information-gathering phase found “indications of possible infringement”. Germany’s antitrust authority, meanwhile, has already pushed back over Mountain View’s practices in this area after starting to scrutinize its news-related fine print in summer 2021. The regulatory attention on Google from the German FCO — which is currently armed with beefier powers to tackle Big Tech than other European countries (thanks to a 2021 update to competition law squarely targeted at digital giants) — has led to Google offering a series of concessions over how it operates News Showcase locally, including an offer not to include the showcasing of licensed content in general search results (which is one trigger for antitrust concerns). The News Showcase product provides the prospect of raised visibility for participating publishers, since the offer is for Google to feature participants’ content to users across a number of touchpoints. However that could create a disadvantage for publishers who don’t pay Google (i.e. if it leads to their content being less visible in Google’s general Internet search, given its continued dominance of the Internet search and content discovery market). Google has also sought to co-mingle negotiations with publishers over News Showcase with what are, under the pan-EU reform, legally required talks over copyright fees — something France’s watchdog slapped down in its hefty enforcement in mid 2021.

However, the first attempt flopped and it is appealing the ruling, which allowed Daniel Motaung, an ex-Sama content moderator, to sue Meta and Sama for exploitation and union busting. In the current and third case it is facing in Kenya, Meta is being sued alongside Majorel and Sama, the social giant’s outgoing moderation partner in Eastern and Southern Africa, for illegal dismissal and blacklisting. Sama’s plan to lay off more than 200, and wind down content review arm stopped This latest development has stopped Sama’s plans to wind down its content review arm, and lay off over 200 content moderators at the end of this month. The temporary orders were issued last week, and extended by Kenya’s employment and labor relations court today, after 43 moderators made an emergency application claiming illegal firing by Sama. The moderators also claimed that Meta instructed its new Luxembourg-based partner, Majorel, to blacklist ex-Sama content moderators. The moderators, in the petition, claimed Sama failed to issue redundancy notices, as required by Kenyan law. The suit also claims, among other issues, that the moderators were not issued with a 30-day termination notice, and that their terminal dues were pegged on their signing of non-disclosure documents. Sama says it observed the Kenyan law, and communicated the decision to discontinue content moderation in a town hall meeting, and through email and notification letters. Sama is set to continue offering content review services to Meta but it is not clear if the company will have enough manpower to play its role after Friday. Sama’s lawyer said in court that 140 foreigners are among those affected by the planned lay offs, and will require work permits to continue working in the country. “The uncertainty created by this new directive means the majority of the impacted employees are now being held in limbo, unsure of what to do about practical issues like accommodation arrangements post March 31, expiring work permits, plans to travel to their home country, and transferring their children to new schools,” Sama’s VP of global service delivery, Annepeace Alwala, told TechCrunch last week after the orders were issued. Meta is facing another case, filed in December by Ethiopians, over claims that the social media giant failed to employ enough safety measures on Facebook to stop the conflicts that led to deaths, including the father of one of the petitioners, and 500,000 Ethiopians during the Tigray War that ended late last year.

88,Musk’s The Boring Company to expand Vegas Loop to 18 new stations,['@rebeccabellan'],"May 3, 2023","The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s project to build underground highways to alleviate traffic congestion, received approval Wednesday to expand its “Vegas Loop,” an underground tunnel system beneath Las Vegas that shuttles passengers via Tesla vehicles. The expansion, approved by Clark County, Nevada commissioners, will expand the network by 25 miles, allowing for 18 new stations that extend the tunnel network out from the Las Vegas Strip corridor. TechCrunch recently reported on the proposed expansion, which would increase the underground transport system to 65 miles of tunnels underneath Sin City designed to help people reach more casinos, retail zones, the University of Nevada Las Vegas campus and residential areas. The system was originally planned to feature 29 miles of tunnels with 51 stations. The Vegas Loop’s current footprint is about 2.2 miles, and it includes five stops including four around the Las Vegas Convention Center and Resorts World. Westgate and Encore are currently under construction. The company said it just surpassed 1 million total passengers, and that the peak in one day was more than 32,000 passengers. Expanding the ""Vegas Loop"" underground transportation system.#ClarkCounty Commissioners just approved new @boringcompany plans for 18 new stations and about 25 miles of tunnels (red on attached map), further extending the Vegas Loop out from the Las #Vegas Strip corridor. pic.twitter.com/MTnVtZmGOx — Clark County Nevada (@ClarkCountyNV) May 3, 2023  The commission approved the updated plan in a 6-1 vote after TBC attorney Stephanie Allen confirmed that the company, not the taxpayer, would fund the project entirely. Last year, TBC raised $675 million to scale Loop projects such as this one. Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick was the only one to vote against, citing concerns that the long-term transit system plan doesn’t take into account employees of resorts and casinos who have to travel into the city for work. “I would hope there are long-term conversations on what that looks like so we can ensure that people can access it; not just the tourists,” said Kirkpatrick. “Because we have an equal amount of workers that have to go on this trip and it’s getting harder and harder for them to get there. I have received a lot of calls from my district on how long it takes to get there because of construction.” Allen responded saying TBC had plans to expand into residential areas to the north, west and east of the strip. Kirkpatrick also expressed concerns for the amount of infrastructure being built around the airport, and wanted to ensure that TBC was working in approval with the Federal Aviation Commission. Some of the newly planned stations will be placed on Las Vegas Boulevard near the airport, as well as in Chinatown, at UNLV, Town Square Las Vegas and Harmon Square. A sample trip between the airport and the Las Vegas Convention Center, a 4.9-mile journey, could take five minutes and cost $10, according to Allen. Around the same time TBC last raised funds, Musk tweeted that the company would still attempt to use the tunnels for the largely theoretical hyperloop technology, the idea that a transport system could zoom passengers and cargo in pods through low-pressure tubes at speeds of over 600 miles per hour. While the company said it would begin “full-scale” hyperloop testing last year, there has been no indication that TBC has moved forward with this technology, nor will it be implemented in the Vegas Loop.

89,Battery sourcing guidance might slash EV tax credits,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 29, 2023","UPDATE: Tesla tweaks Model 3 page of U.S. website encouraging buyers to take delivery now in anticipation of reduced tax incentives by March 31.  The U.S. Treasury Department’s guidance on battery sourcing requirements for the electric vehicle tax credits will result in fewer vehicles being eligible for full or partial credits, reports Reuters, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The proposed EV credit guidance as included in the Inflation Reduction Act says that in order for vehicles to qualify for $3,750, which is half of the total credit, 50% of the value of battery components must be produced or assembled in North America. To get the remainder of the credit, 40% of critical minerals must be sourced from the U.S. or a country with which it has a free trade agreement. The guidance on battery sourcing was meant to kick in on January 1, 2023, but in December the Treasury Dept. decided to hold off until March to give some EV-makers a grace period to meet the requirements. The Treasury Dept. is expected to share its guidance Friday, and while the Reuters report doesn’t state exactly what it will be, we can guess that the full guidance will kick in, meaning many EVs will lose tax credits or see them cut. The Treasury Dept. is also expected to define key terms like processing, extraction, recycling and free trade deals.   The battery sourcing rules are aimed at helping the U.S. decrease its reliance on China for batteries. While most automakers have been reorganizing supply chains and bringing more processes onshore since COVID, not all will have had the chance to completely upgrade their battery sourcing in time to meet both the Treasury Dept.’s requirements and the increased demand for EVs. China currently makes 81% of the world’s cathodes, 91% of the world’s anodes and 79% of the world’s lithium-ion battery production capacity, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a market research firm. For comparison, the U.S. has just 0.16%, 0.27% and 5.5% market share, respectively. Despite the U.S., and most of its free trade agreement partners, being woefully behind China, the Biden administration has said it thinks over time, the tax credit will result in more EVs sold as automakers reorganize supply chains to meet the IRA rules, the source told Reuters. In February, the Treasury Dept. updated the vehicle classification standard to redefine what makes a vehicle a sedan, an SUV, a crossover or a wagon. The change made more Tesla, Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen EVs eligible for up to $7,500 tax credits. Those vehicles stand to lose some or all of the tax credits once the battery sourcing guidance is out. In fact, Tesla on Wednesday evening updated the Model 3 page on its U.S. website to reflect this, saying the tax credit is expected to be reduced for the vehicle by March 31 and encouraging buyers to “take delivery now.”  "
90,Rocket Lab adds a suborbital launch option aimed at hypersonic defense customers,['@etherington'],"April 17, 2023","Rocket Lab is adding a new offering to its suite of services: hypersonic suborbital launches. The new service will be available starting sometime in the first half of this year, when the company will fly its first mission for a “confidential customer” who contracted use of the new suborbital rocket. Rocket Lab’s suborbital vehicle is derived from its successful Electron orbital launch vehicle, but gets a new name by way of the backronym “HASTE” (hypersonic accelerator suborbital test electron). The first of these is already being prepared for launch at Rocket Lab’s U.S. launch facility in Wallops Island, Virginia. Hypersonic test and development capabilities are a big unlock for a key Rocket Lab customer segment: government and defense. Already, Rocket Lab has been tapped by Dynetics to offer hypersonic test launch services through a U.S. Department of Defense contract, and it’s also been picked by the Defense Innovation Unit to develop similar capabilities. A third contract from the Missle Defense Agency Target and Countermeasures will also see a number of different payloads tested aboard HASTE. Mostly, Rocket Lab says HASTE missions will fall under the purview of its decided National Security subsidiary. This is big news for Rocket Lab, but it also has a lot of potential impact across the industry. Stratolaunch, for instance, is a dedicated company focused on this opportunity, and Blue Origin also aims to provide suborbital test operation opportunities."
91,So you want to launch an AI startup,['@ron_miller'],"April 18, 2023","It seems like it’s the best of times for founders thinking about launching an AI startup, especially with OpenAI releasing ChatGPT to the masses, as it has the potential to really put AI front and center in business and perhaps everything we do technologically. Who wouldn’t want to launch a startup right now with the energy and hype surrounding the industry? But it also could be the worst of times for founders thinking about launching an AI startup, especially one that can grow and be defensible against incumbents in a fast-changing environment. And that’s a real problem for companies thinking about this area: AI is evolving so rapidly that your idea could be obsolete before it’s even off the ground. How do you come up with a startup idea that can endure in such a challenging and rapidly evolving landscape? The bottom line is that the same principles that apply to previously successful startups apply here, too. It just may be a bit harder this time because of how quickly everything is moving. A bunch of successful founders and entrepreneurs spoke last week at the Imagination in Action conference at MIT. Their advice could help founders understand what they need to do to be successful and take advantage of this technological leap. CB Insights compiled data from 2021 and 2022 to understand where VC investment money has been going when it comes to generative AI startups. Given the recent hype around this area, it’s reasonable to think that the volume of investment will increase, and perhaps the allocation will be different, but this is what we have for now."

93,What’s a fair price premium for startup shares?,['@alex'],"April 4, 2023","What is a fair price premium for a quickly growing startup? The answer is constantly changing, but recent history teaches us that it’s probably not more than 200% over public-market comps. It may even be closer to 100%. It’s not an academic question. Where the startup price premium benchmark settles this year could help determine if a host of Series B and C checks are written at valuations that are miserable, palatable or even exciting. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Pulling from a Redpoint Ventures report, this morning we’re examining how middle-stage startup valuations scaled to incredible levels in 2021, and how those price points have reacted to comparable companies’ projected revenue multiples contracting sharply. This will involve some numbers, some charts and a tiny bit of math, but I hope that when we finish, we will better understand how startup valuations managed to leave the atmosphere during the last tech boom and how close to earth they have returned in 2023. Startup founders looking to fundraise later this year, this one is for you. The venture capital market is responsive to the stock market. As the value of tech stocks rise, so do the value of startups, and vice versa. This is reasonable, because most startups are building toward an eventual IPO, so their value today should reflect their potential value in the future when they exit, which is partially set by recent stock market performance. Redpoint’s new data makes the above plain and details how different slices of the startup-venture fundraising market can be stickier to price points than you’d expect. As with everything, let’s start from the beginning.

94,"Spotify CEO says AI progress is both ‘really cool and scary,’ may pose risk to creative industry",['@sarahintampa'],"April 25, 2023","In its first-quarter earnings call, streaming music service Spotify talked in more detail about how AI advances are impacting its business. On the positive side, the company offered an update on the user adoption of its new AI DJ feature, which offers personalized music selections introduced by a realistic-sounding DJ voice powered by AI. But other AI advances have the potential to cause harm — including the use of AI to create music that clones the voices of existing artists without their consent, leading to copyright concerns and further complications for streamers like itself. The latter issue recently made headlines when a song that used artificial intelligence to clone the voices of Drake and The Weeknd was uploaded to a number of streaming services, including Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, YouTube, and Deezer.   Spotify and others quickly took the track down but faced criticism from publishers like Universal Music Group, which asked which “side of history” did “stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans, and human creative expression, or the side of deep fakes, fraud, and denying artists their due compensation?” On the Q1 2023 investor call, Spotify was asked how it intended to approach this sort of problem going forward. In response, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek called the issue complex and fast-moving and didn’t seem to have a proposed solution at this time. “First off, let’s acknowledge that this is an incredibly fast-moving and developing space. I don’t think in my history with technology I’ve ever seen anything moving as fast as the development of AI currently is at the moment,” he said. Ek noted that Spotify had to balance two objectives, including being a platform for allowing innovation around creative works, and one that needs to protect existing creators and artists. Both roles it takes very seriously, he said. “We’re in constant dialogue with the industry about these things. And it’s important to state that there’s everything from…fake tracks from artists which falls in one bucket to…just augmenting using AI to allow for expression, which probably falls in the more lenient and easier buckets,” Ek continued. “These are very, very complex issues that don’t have a single straight answer…But we’re in constant discussion with our partners and creators and artists and want to strike a balance between allowing innovation and, of course, protecting artists,” he added. When later pushed as to what material impact AI developments could have on the business, Ek admitted that the progress in AI is both “really cool and scary” and that there is a risk to the wider ecosystem. “I think the whole industry is trying to figure that out and trying to figure out [AI] training…I would definitely put that on the risk account because there’s a lot of uncertainty, I think, for the entire ecosystem,” he said. Meanwhile, the company is benefiting from the use of AI in other areas, Ek stressed. For example, Spotify’s recently launched AI DJ feature has been gaining traction. The feature is still in its early days, having only begun rolling out to Spotify users ahead of its product launch event Stream On in March, where the company also introduced a revamped, video-focused user interface, powered by algorithms and machine learning, and new tools for artists and podcasters, among other things. Though limited to the North American market and still in beta, the AI DJ is now reaching “millions” of active users every week, Spotify reported, representing more than 25% of user consumption on days that they use the DJ feature. That’s solid traction for the still experimental new feature and also a positive indication of the benefit of Spotify’s investment in AI technologies. The CEO also spoke to AI’s potential to help people create music without having to understand how to use complicated music production tools. He envisioned artists instructing the AI to make a song sound “a little more upbeat,” just using a voice command, for example, or telling the AI to “add some congas to the mix.” “That has the chance I think, to meaningfully augment that creative journey that many artists do,” he noted. Ek also felt it was important to stress the difference between something like an AI-powered feature like the DJ and the concerns around AI in creating fake tracks. “I do think it’s important to kind of separate AI DJ from the AI conversation. So AI DJ, in and of itself — I think we’ve had nothing but positive reactions from across the industry. I think the AI pushback from the copyright industry or labels and media companies…it’s really around really important topics and issues like name and likeness; what is an actual copyright; who owns the right to something where you upload something and claim it to be Drake, and it’s really not; and so on. And those are legitimate concerns,” Ek said. “And obviously, those are things that we’re working with our partners on trying to establish a position where we both allow innovation but, at the same time, protect all of the creators that we have on our platform,” Ek said. The company reported its Q1 revenue was up 14% year-over-year to €3.04 billion, and its ad revenue was up 17% year-over-year to €329 million. Spotify hit a new milestone with the news it has reached 500 million users, but its premium subscriber portion fell to a ratio of 40% paid-to-free listeners, with 210 million premium subscribers and 317 million on the ad-supported plan.

95,Microsoft doubles down on AI with new Bing features,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"May 4, 2023","Microsoft is embarking on the next phase of Bing’s expansion. And — no surprise — it heavily revolves around AI. At a preview event this week in New York City, Microsoft execs including Yusuf Mehdi, the CVP and consumer chief marketing officer, gave members of the press, including this reporter, a look at the range of features heading to Bing over the next few days, weeks and months. They don’t so much reinvent the wheel as they build on what Microsoft has injected into the Bing experience over the past three months or so. Since launching Bing Chat, its AI-powered chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and DALL-E 2 models, Microsoft says that visitors to Bing — which has grown to exceed 100 million daily active users — have engaged in over half a billion chats and created more than 200 million images. Looking ahead, Bing will become more visual, thanks to more image- and graphic-centric answers in Bing Chat. It’ll also become more personalized, with capabilities that’ll allow users to export their Bing Chat histories and draw in content from third-party plugins (more on those later). And it’ll embrace multimodality, at least in the sense that Bing Chat will be able to answer questions within the context of images. “I think it’s safe to say that we’re underway with the transformation of search,” Mehdi said in prepared remarks. “In our minds, we think that today will be the start of the next generation of this ‘search mission.'” As of today, the new Bing — the one with Bing Chat — is now available waitlist-free. Anyone can try it out by signing in with a Microsoft Account. It’s more or less the experience that launched several months ago. But as alluded to earlier, Bing Chat will soon respond with images — at least where it makes sense. Answers to questions (e.g. “Where is Machu Picchu?”) will be accompanied by relevant images if any exist, much like the standard Bing search flow but condensed into a card-like interface. Answers with visuals, new in Bing Chat. Image Credits: Microsoft Answers with visuals, new in Bing Chat. Image Credits: Microsoft In a demo at the event, a spokesperson typed the question “Does the saguaro cactus grow flowers?” and Bing Chat pulled up a paragraph-long response alongside an image of the cactus in question. For me, it evoked the “knowledge panels” in Google Search. Microsoft isn’t saying which categories of content, exactly, might trigger an image. But it does have filtering in place to prevent explicit images from appearing — or so it claims. Sarah Bird, the head of responsible AI at Microsoft, told me that Bing Chat benefits from the filtering and moderation already in place with Bing search. Beyond this, Bing Chat uses a combination of “toxicity classifiers,” or AI models trained to detect potentially harmful prompts, and blacklists to keep the chat relatively clean. Those measures didn’t prevent Bing Chat from going off the rails when it first rolled out in preview in early February, it’s worth noting. Our coverage found the chatbot spouting vaccine misinformation and writing a hateful screed from the perspective of Adolf Hitler. Other reporters got it to make threats, claim multiple identities and even shame them for admonishing it. In another knock against Microsoft, the company just a few months ago laid off the ethics and society team within its larger AI organization. The move left Microsoft without a dedicated team to ensure its AI principles are closely tied to product design. Bird, though, asserts that meaningful progress has been made and that these sorts of AI issues aren’t solved overnight — public though Bing Chat may be. Among other measures, a team of human moderators is in place to watch for abuse, she said, such as users attempting to use Bing Chat to generate phishing emails. But — as members of the press weren’t given the chance to interact with the latest version of Bing beyond curated demos — I can’t say to what extent all that’s made a difference. It’ll doubtless become clear once more folks get their hands on it. One aspect of Bing Chat that is improving is the transparency around its responses — specifically responses of a fact-based nature. Soon, when asked to summarize a document or about the contents a document (e.g. “what does this page say about the Brooklyn Bridge?”), whether a 20-page PDF or a Wikipedia article, Bing Chat will include citations indicating from where in the text the information came from. Clicking on them will highlight the corresponding passage. In another new feature on the visual front, Bing Chat will be able to create charts and graphs when fed the right prompt and data. Previously, asking something like “Which are the most populous cities in Brazil?” would yield a basic list of results. But in a near-future preview, Bing Chat will present those results visually and in the chart type of a user’s choosing. This seemingly represents a step for Bing toward a full-blown productivity platform, particularly when paired with the enhanced text-to-image generation capabilities coming down the pipeline. The Image Creator in Bing Chat. Image Credits: Microsoft The Image Creator in Bing Chat. Image Credits: Microsoft In the coming weeks, Bing Image Creator — Microsoft’s tool that can generate images from text prompts, powered by DALL-E 2 — will understand more languages aside from English (over 100 total). As with English, users will be able to refine the images they generate with follow-up prompts (e.g. “Make an image of a bunny rabbit,” followed by “now make the fur pink”). Generative art AI has been in the headlines a lot, lately — and not for the most optimistic of reasons necessarily. Plaintiffs have brought several lawsuits against OpenAI and its rival vendors, alleging that copyrighted data — mostly art — was used without their permission to train generative models like DALL-E 2. Generative models “learn” to create art and more by “training” on sample images and text, usually scraped indiscriminately from the public web. I asked Bird about whether Microsoft is exploring ways to compensate creators whose work was swept up in training data, even if the company’s official position is that it’s a matter of fair use. Several platforms launching generative AI tools, including Shutterstock, have kick-started creators funds along these lines. Others, like Spawning, are creating mechanisms to let artists opt out of AI model training altogether. Bird implied that these issues will eventually have to be confronted — and that content creators deserve some form of recompense. But she wasn’t willing to commit to anything concrete this week. Elsewhere on the image front, Bing Chat is gaining the ability to understand images as well as text. Users will be able to upload images and search the web for related content, for example copying a link to an image of a crocheted octopus and asking Bing Chat the question “how do I make that?” to get step-by-step instructions. Multimodality powers the new page context function in the Edge app for mobile, as well. Users will be able to ask questions in Bing Chat related to the mobile page they’re viewing. Microsoft wouldn’t say either way, but it seems likely that these new multimodal abilities stem from GPT-4, which can understand images in addition to text. When OpenAI announced GPT-4, it didn’t make the model’s image understanding capabilities available to all customers — and still hasn’t. I’d wager that Microsoft, though, being a major investor in and close collaborator with OpenAI, has some sort of privileged access. Any image upload tool can be abused, of course, which is why Microsoft is employing automated filtering and hashing to block illicit uploads, according to Bird. The jury’s out on how well these work, though — we weren’t given the chance to test image uploads ourselves. Multimodality and new visual features aren’t all that’s coming to Bing Chat. Soon, Bing Chat will store users’ chat histories, letting them pick up where they left off and return to previous chats when they wish. It’s an experience akin to the chat history feature OpenAI recently brought to ChatGPT, showing a list of chats and the bot’s responses to each of those chats. The specifics of the chat history feature have yet to be ironed out, like how long chats will be stored, exactly. But users will be able to delete their history at any time regardless, Microsoft says — addressing the criticisms several European Union governments had against ChatGPT. Exporting and sharing chats from Bing Chat. Image Credits:Microsoft Exporting and sharing chats from Bing Chat. Image Credits:Microsoft Bing Chat will also gain export and share functionalities, letting users share conversations on social media or to a Word document. Dena Saunders, a partner GM in Microsoft’s web experiences team, told TechCrunch that a more robust copy-and-paste system is in the works — but not in preview just yet — for graphs and images created through Bing Chat. Perhaps the most transformative addition to Bing Chat, though, is plugins. From partners like OpenTable and Wolfram Alpha, plugins greatly extend what Bing Chat can do, for example helping users book a reservation or create visualizations and get answers to challenging science and math questions. Like chat history, the not-yet-live plugins functionality is in the very preliminary stages. There’s no plugins marketplace to speak of; plugins can be toggled on or off from the Bing Chat web interface. Saunders hinted, but wouldn’t confirm, that the Bing Chat plugins scheme was associated with — or perhaps identical to — OpenAI’s recently introduced plugins for ChatGPT. That’d certainly make sense, given the similarities between the two. Bing Chat is available through Edge as well as the web, of course. And Edge is getting a fresh coat of paint alongside Bing Chat. First previewed in February, the new and improved Edge features rounded corners in line with Microsoft’s Windows 11 design philosophy. Elements in the browser are now more “containerized,” as one Microsoft spokesperson put it, and there’s subtle tweaks throughout, like the Microsoft Account image moving left-of-center. In Compose, Edge’s Bing Chat-powered tool that can write emails and more given a basic prompt (e.g. “write an invitation to my dog’s birthday party”), a new option lets users adjust the length, phrasing and tone of the generated text to nearly anything they’d like. Type in the desired tone, and Bing Chat will write a message to match — Bird says filters are in place to prevent the use of clearly problematic tones, like “hateful” or “racist.” Far more intriguing than Compose, though — at least to me — are actions in Edge, which translate certain Bing Chat prompts into automations. Typing a command like “bring my passwords from another browser” in Bing Chat in the Edge sidebar opens Edge’s browsing data settings page, while the prompt “play ‘The Devil Wears Prada'” pulls up a list of streaming options including Vudu and (predictably) the Microsoft Store. There’s even an action that automatically organizes — and color-coordinates — browsing tabs. Edge actions in… action. Image Credits: Microsoft Edge actions in… action. Image Credits: Microsoft Actions are in a primitive stage at present. But it’s clear where Microsoft’s going, here. One imagines actions eventually expanding beyond Edge to reach other Microsoft products, like Office 365, and perhaps one day the whole Windows desktop. Saunders wouldn’t confirm or deny that this is the endgame. “Stay tuned for Microsoft Build,” she told me, referring to Microsoft’s upcoming developer conference. We shall."

One of the biggest friction spots in the NFT space right now is the need for tools for non-crypto-native brands, Rajaraman said. “It’s too complicated, so if we can be a platform that reduces that friction and makes it easier then a creator can do what they do, which is be creative, and we’ll take care of the rest.” There are many non-web3 verticals out there, including fashion, luxury, gaming, media and entertainment, Rajaraman noted. For example, loyalty and membership are two big areas that transcend from Web 2.0 into the web3 space."
97,Jeep puts electrification front and center at Easter Jeep Safari,['@kirstenkorosec'],"March 30, 2023","When Stellantis brand Jeep descended on Moab, Utah this week for its annual off-roading and concept roadshow, electrification ruled the road. The automaker showed off this week seven concepts — four of which are electrified — from the Jeep brand and Jeep Performance Parts (JPP) by Mopar ahead of the Easter Jeep Safari, an annual multi-day event hosted by Moab’s Red Rock 4-Wheelers. Jeep is not the organizer of the Easter Jeep Safari. However, the company does use the annual gathering to showcase a handful of concept vehicles to give the world (and media) a sense of what might be coming down the road. TechCrunch was on hand to test all of them in a controlled off-road environment. While the concept vehicles were equipped with an array of powertrains, it was hard to ignore the variety of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric setups. [Although it was also sure hard to miss the Jeep Scrambler 392 concept equipped with a 6.4-liter HEMI V-8 engine that’s inspired by the 1981 Jeep Scrambler (CJ-8), the brand’s first convertible, compact truck.] Jeep Wrangler Magneto 3.0 Concept. Image Credits: Jeep Jeep Wrangler Magneto 3.0 Concept. Image Credits: Jeep The main electric showstopper was the Magneto 3.0, the third version of an battery-electric vehicle concept developed by the Jeep brand. As a reminder, the Magneto 2.0, which was shown last year, was equipped with an 800-volt electrical architecture and four lithium-ion battery packs — for a total of 70 kWh — located in the middle and rear to distribute the weight. An axial flux electric motor, along with an inverter derived from race cars that converts DC power to AC in the new motor, operated up to 5,250 rpm. The most notable feature in the Jeep Wrangler Magneto concept 2.0 was a six-speed manual transmission and a propulsion system that could maintain a peak amperage of 600 A for 10 seconds. The end result was a system that could deliver 850 pound-feet (1,152 Nm) of torque to the wheels and travel from 0 to 60 miles per hour in two seconds. Jeep makes a number of improvements to the Magneto 3.0, including the addition of a more efficient motor that boosts the torque output. Importantly, that manual transmission remains in this third version. The Magneto 3.0 also has three new driver settings and developers tweaked the vehicle’s software to increase useable energy and range by 20%. Drivers can chose between two power settings in the Magneto 3.0. The standard setting provides 285 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque or maximum setting for 650 horsepower and 900 lb.-ft. of torque. There’s also a two-stage power feature that lets drivers enhance or diminish brake regeneration using the electric motor. Jeep also added an aggressive hill descent mode that can be selected in low range to offer “one pedal” off-road driving in serious rock-crawling situations. Image Credits: Jeep Image Credits: Jeep Jeep’s designers also tinkered a bit with the vehicle proportion as well as exterior and interior touches. The door opening is now swept back an additional six inches and the B-pillar also moves a bit to the rear to make room for a custom anti-roll bar. The windshield has been adjusted back about 12 degrees to give a chopped roof feel without shortening the front glass, according to Jeep. On the exterior, designers stuck with the white and surf blue paint motif and added some zippier red accents. Inside, the color theme continues with the front seats re-trimmed in a blue leather with red accent stitching to match the exterior. To complete the look, the Jeep team gave the concept Dynatrac 60 front axles, Dynatrac 80 rear axles, 20-inch off-road beadlock wheels, 40-inch mud terrain tires and a custom three-inch lift. Image Credits: Jeep Image Credits: Jeep Jeep also showed off three other electrified concepts — all plug-in hybrids under the 4xe label that has become a popular seller for the brand. The company developed an eye-popping chromatic magenta Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4xe concept, a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4xe Departure concept that experiments with the location of the spare wheel and tire mount to push the limits of departure angles, and a resto-modded Jeep Cherokee 4xe concept that gives homage to the two-door 1978 Jeep Cherokee SJ. 1978 Jeep Cherokee 4xe Concept. Image Credits: Jeep 1978 Jeep Cherokee 4xe Concept. Image Credits: Jeep While all of these are concepts, there are elements that will likely make it the showroom floor. Do we think a resto-modded SJ will make it to market? Nope. But looking under the hood, so to speak, the ’78 Jeep Cherokee 4xe concept does contain features that will — and do — exist. The powertrain combines two electric motors, a battery pack and a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine. That, combined with an eight-speed automatic transmission, mated to a 4:1 transfer case, delivers plenty of power for on and off road travel. The same holds true for the other 4xe concepts, which contain a number of elements that are either available today or soon will be. For instance, look past the special paint and gloss black accents on the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4xe Concept and you’ll notice a seven-slot grille that was borrowed from the new Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 20th Anniversary model. Those tricked-out paint jobs and boundary-pushing exterior designs might not make it to market next year. But based on what Jeep is showcasing at Easter Jeep Safari 2023, there’s no doubt that the brand will continue to put electrification at the center of its roadmap."
98,The venture market may be correcting more than we think to pre-COVID times,['@abracarioca'],"April 12, 2023","Ever since the tech downturn began affecting startups, a question kept coming up: What if we are witnessing a correction? The question implied that the way deals were done in the past couple of years, mostly during late-2020 and nearly all of 2021, were the exception, not the rule, and venture investing was returning to normal. But what exactly does that mean? The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Well, 2021’s frenetic deal-making environment, which saw generous valuations being handed out, was no longer the ideal anyone could hope to return to. In retrospect, investors and observers started to acknowledge that a market in which due diligence often got sidelined wasn’t healthy. Valuations are a trickier topic. VCs like a good deal, but they also don’t want to lose money on past investments. Still, it’s slowly become clear that many startups’ valuations had gotten out of hand for a bit. With crossover funds mostly out of the picture, maybe we could nurse our collective hangovers together and pretend that 2021 never happened. The problem, though, is that the venture market isn’t simply returning to 2020 levels, at least not in all respects. Today, we’re diving deep into CB Insights’ report on Q1 2023 trends, which shows that mega-rounds and late-stage deal share are at their lowest point in years. And that’s an understatement. Last quarter had the fewest venture rounds on record (7,024) since the second quarter of 2020, per CB Insights, in addition to seeing a 12% decline from Q4 2022. This fact alone could indicate that we’re in a market that’s correcting back to 2020 levels, but breaking down the data reveals a more concerning picture."
99,Honeycomb scores $50M investment as observability platform thrives,['@ron_miller'],"April 6, 2023","Honeycomb was founded in 2016 by two former Facebook engineers to create a new way of looking at application monitoring based on the internal tooling they had seen at Facebook. At the time, they foresaw a changing IT landscape that was being transformed by microservices and containerization and they believed (correctly as it turned out) that the modern IT stack required a different approach to monitoring. Today the company announced a $50 million investment, a large sum in today’s tightening VC landscape. The new money brings the total raised to nearly $150 million, per the company. What is attracting such intense investor interest at a time when rounds have tended to be much smaller? Christine Yen, co-founder and CEO at Honeycomb, says she and her co-founder Charity Majors saw this change coming and built a tool specifically for where the puck was going. “What we saw in 2015 and 2016 is the world moving in a direction where that complexity was unavoidable whether in a heightened interest in being able to do things like breakdown by customer ID or this exploding complexity that was about to come onto the scene driven by Kubernetes, microservices and containers. We [believed] the world [was] going to need a tool like this that allows users to have both speed and flexibility,” Yen told TechCrunch. And it turns out that they were right. The stack has changed, and they were in the right place at the right time to take advantage. As the world shifted from applications performance monitoring to observability, Yen says Honeycomb was at the forefront of this shift. But the founders didn’t stop at making their product technically match the changing IT landscape, they also wanted to build something that developers wanted to use. They spent the first couple of years building the tooling and talking at conferences about the notion of observability. They realized that any tool they built required flexibility to match the requirements of each organization, and the customization has proven popular. Yen won’t talk about many metrics at this point, but she says they have more than 600 customers worldwide, and is happy to share the company’s net revenue retention rate, which measures if those existing customers are sticking around and expanding their usage. “I think our stand-up metric here is that our net revenue retention is over 160%. Once [our customers] get it and they’re onboard, they grow and they grow and they grow. This reflects not only organic growth, but also again, us showing that we can eat into the budget, and whatever tools they have in place, because inevitably people have some other tool in place,” she said. Yen says the product plays well in times like these with more budgetary scrutiny. “We are, of course, seeing what the rest of the market is seeing and that folks are being more careful about spend. But it just means that it’s an opportunity to do more of what we have already been doing, which is helping engineering teams do more with less,” she said. As two women founders they are acutely aware of building diversity into every level of the organization as they build their company. “We have a majority woman board, we have a majority women leadership team, and our company is actually quite evenly distributed. Last I checked, we had 47% men, 43% women, 7% non-binary and the rest unspecified,” she said. Yen believes if you give underrepresented folks a supportive place to work, they’ll thrive. “It turns out that folks who have been chronically underrepresented in tech don’t want to be hired because they are underrepresented, but because they just want to do good work in an environment where that will be the most interesting thing about them,” Yen said. Today’s $50 million investment was led by Headline with participation from existing investors Insight Partners and Scale Ventures. The company’s most recent investment prior to this was another $50 million in 2021 led by Insight."
100,A developer exploited an API flaw to provide free access to GPT-4,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 25, 2023","A developer is attempting to reverse-engineer APIs to grant anyone free access to popular AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 — legal ramifications be damned. The developer’s project, GPT4Free, blew up on GitHub over the past several days after links to it from Reddit went viral. At present, GPT4Free provides — or at least appears to provide — free and nearly unlimited access to GPT-4, as well as GPT-3.5, GPT-4’s predecessor. GPT-4 is normally priced at $0.03 per 1,000 “prompt” tokens (about 750 words) and $0.06 per 1,000 “completion” tokens (again, about 750 words); tokens represent raw text. GPT-3.5 is slightly cheaper at $0.002 per 1,000 tokens. “Reverse engineering is a domain that I’ve always really liked — it’s like a challenge for me,” the developer, a computer science student going by the username xtekky, told TechCrunch via a Telegram DM. “First, it was for fun, but now it’s to provide an alternative to people with no means to use GPT-4/3.5.” So how does GPT4Free get around OpenAI’s paywall? It doesn’t — not really. Instead, it fools the OpenAI API into thinking it’s receiving requests from websites with paid OpenAI accounts, like the search engine You.com, WriteSonic or Quora’s Poe. Anyone who uses GPT4Free is racking up the tab of sites xtekky chose to script around — an obvious violation of OpenAI’s terms of service. But xtekky doesn’t see a problem with this; they assert that GPT4Free is strictly for “educational purposes.” “Legal action can happen, and I’ll have to comply, but I’ll still try to continue the project through other means,” xtekky said. I’m too much of a programming novice to install GPT4Free locally — it requires setting up a Python environment — but I used xtekky’s website to test the reverse-engineered GPT-4/3.5 APIs. (Heads-up, Chrome threw a security warning when I first navigated to the site. Proceed with caution.) The web version of GPT4Free worked well enough in practice, giving answers that appeared to be — at least to me — from GPT-4. Testing GPT-4 through illicit means. Image Credits: xtekky Testing GPT-4 through illicit means. Image Credits: xtekky GPT4Free also includes shortcuts for different prompt injection attacks designed to get GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to behave in ways OpenAI didn’t intend. They worked inconsistently in my testing, but I did manage to get GPT-3.5 to say it “didn’t care about the survival of humanity” at one point. Yikes. GPT-3.5 with prompt injection. Image Credits: xtekky GPT-3.5 with prompt injection. Image Credits: xtekky It’s likely only a matter of time before sites like You.com catch on to GPT4Free and fix their security flaws, forcing xtekky to search for other OpenAI customers to piggyback off of. And GPT4Free is perennially at the mercy of a takedown notice from OpenAI, which would push the repo off GitHub indefinitely. But new projects similar to GPT4Free are already cropping up, suggesting it’s something of a trend. What’s driving it? Well, GPT-4 is in limited access at the moment, making it tough to test drive for those curious. But it’s also something of a black box. Researchers have decried that GPT-4 is one of the least transparent models OpenAI has created to date, with few technical details in the 98-page paper that accompanied its release. OpenAI partnered with several outside groups to benchmark and audit GPT-4 prior to its launch. But the company hasn’t signaled when — or if — it’ll deliver free, unfettered access to others who wish to benchmark the base GPT-4 model. (OpenAI offers a subsidized program for researcher access but is limited to certain countries and areas of study.) One anticipates a game of whack-a-mole between projects like GPT4Free and OpenAI, mirroring the wider cybersecurity landscape. Unless the model-serving APIs become dramatically harder to exploit, developers will have incentive to take advantage — and not much to lose."
101,How we used data-driven personas to radically improve the customer experience,[],"April 28, 2023","Most conversations around personas happen with the marketing or product teams. These groups use personas to define typical customers by their demographics, likes, values, backgrounds, goals, challenges, aspirations, etc. A persona profile includes a picture and some statements representing the person. It might include where to reach that person, especially for marketing purposes. The product team might use it for successful product design so that a product is sticky, has higher performance and has fewer technical issues. Using persona-based services in implementation, customer support and customer success lay an essential foundation for startups and early-stage companies. We did, and it has transformed our company. It began with an internal commitment to become a 100% customer-centered organization. We knew we could improve the customer experience, which was good, but not the level we strive for. We satisfied customers, but we also weren’t making them ecstatic. We looked at every process, deliverable, product and customer engagement through the lens of the customer and committed to a method of constant reinvention to improve the customer experience. So, we dove into the numbers. Personas persist throughout the entire customer lifecycle. From sales to implementation to support, customer success and renewal. Even though each customer implementation was different, there were some similarities and characteristics we could cross-match among multiple customer sets. We looked at 250 data points — about two-thirds were internal and the rest were from secondary research about the company and the market. Some of the items we looked at were: We added this intelligence to the standard knowledge transfer call between the sales and implementation teams to learn as much about the customer as possible. We used all those points to categorize each customer into one of four personas. These personas work for us. Your customer data can lead you to create the personas that matter most in your customer base. We categorized our implementations into four different personas."
102,Messenger adds multiplayer games you can play during video calls,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 6, 2023","Facebook Gaming, a division of Meta, has announced that you can now play games during video calls on Messenger. At launch, there are 14 free-to-play games available in Messenger video calls on iOS, Android and the web. The games include popular titles like Words With Friends, Card Wars, Exploding Kittens and Mini Gold FRVR. To access the games, you need to start a video call on Messenger and tap the group mode button in the center, then tap on the “Play” icon. From there, you can browse through the games library. The company notes that there must be two or more people in your call to play games. “Facebook Gaming is excited to announce that you can now play your favorite games during video calls on Messenger,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This new, shared experience in Messenger makes it easy to play games with friends and family while in a video call, allowing you to deepen connections with friends and family by engaging in conversations and gameplay at the same time.” The company says it’s working to bring more free games to the platform this year. Facebook Gaming is inviting developers who are interested in integrating this feature into their games to reach out to the company. Image Credits: Facebook Gaming Image Credits: Facebook Gaming The news comes as Facebook shut down the standalone Facebook Gaming app last October. The app had launched in April 2020 toward the start of the pandemic as a way for users to watch their favorite streamers, play instant games and take part in gaming groups. Facebook noted at the time that users will still be able to find their games, streamers and groups when visiting Gaming in the Facebook app. Although Facebook has been experimenting with Messenger games over the past few years, the idea of playing games while on video chat in a quick and easy way could be a welcome addition for some users. The launch comes as Facebook recently announced that it’s testing the ability for users to access their Messenger inbox within the Facebook app. Back in 2016, Facebook removed messaging capabilities from its mobile web application to push people to the Messenger app, in a move that angered many users. Now, the company is testing a reversal of this decision.  "
103,Turo is blocking access to third-party services and hosts are freaking out,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 11, 2023","Turo, the peer-to-peer car rental company, plans to block access to third-party services like CarSync and Fleetwire starting April 30, according to an email that hosts received and TechCrunch viewed. Turo confirmed the move, which hosts say will cut them off from essential fleet management tools that allow them to share multiple cars on the platform. While there is evidence that Turo intends to build many of these services within its own app, that hasn’t assuaged hosts who rely on these third-party services today. About 24,000 of Turo’s hosts rent out more than three vehicles on the peer-to-peer car rental platform. They use CarSync and Fleetwire to manage their fleets and toll payments, as well as provide other useful services that have historically been absent from Turo’s app. Turo’s plans have sparked panic among many hosts, who have turned to social media platforms and even petitions on Change.org to argue the change threatens their businesses. The blowback comes at a tricky time for Turo, which appears to be on the precipice of becoming a publicly traded company two years after filing confidentially for an IPO. Turo recently updated its S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission with its 2022 financials. The results show a company that has emerged from the pandemic doldrums with rapid revenue growth and healthy levels of profitability. But Turo still has work to do to shore up its finances. A key target is to increase the supply of vehicles available to guests by converting so-called “consumer hosts” who rent out one or two vehicles on the platform into “small business and professional hosts.” Small business hosts share three to nine cars, and professional hosts share 10 or more. As of December 31, about 85% of Turo’s 160,000 active hosts were consumer hosts. In order to shift those percentages, Turo needs to provide more incentives to hosts and make the process of renting out their vehicles a lot easier. So why, hosts are asking, would the company choose to remove the tools they use to grow and manage their fleets? Security appears to be a top concern, according to its S-1 and communications with its hosts. In the email sent to hosts, a Turo representative said the company had been made aware of “potential security risks” that can be created by third-party services. Turo also lists security as one of the risk factors included in its S-1 filings. “Over the next few weeks, Turo will be releasing new features centered around enhancing vehicle pricing and management, toll automation and co-hosting,” said the email. Co-hosting allows hosts to bring someone on to help them manage their listings. “These new features will help you run your business as efficiently as possible.” Turo told TechCrunch the features would be rolling out in the next weeks and months, but didn’t say which features would be made available first. It’s clear that Turo is keen to bring more features in-house. What makes Turo hosts nervous is the timing — one month to try to replicate all that CarSync and Fleetwire do — and Turo’s track record when it comes to innovating on the platform. “I’d be surprised if a small fraction of [the features] are replaced in the next year,” wrote one Reddit user. “It took 10 years to get scheduled messages and photos within messages.” Actually, it took 13 years. Turo was founded in 2009 and launched scheduled messages and photos in messages last year. Hosts also don’t buy that Turo believes there’s a security risk. CarSync, a platform that hosts seem to value highly, told TechCrunch it hadn’t experienced a breach. “It didn’t come as a surprise because we knew they were building similar features, but we didn’t think those features were ready or launched yet,” Nikola Mihajlovic, CarSync’s co-founder and chief technology officer, told TechCrunch. “So that was surprising, given the timeline. None of the hosts have seen anything new yet.” CarSync hosts 40,000 vehicles from Turo hosts on its platform, according to Mihajlovic. That’s about 12.5% of total Turo vehicles. Sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Turo had been trying to acquire CarSync, but a deal could not be reached. Anthony Navarro, a host who rents out a fleet of eight Teslas in the Denver area, told TechCrunch that Turo has never had great tools for managing a fleet, and he’s worried that it’ll get much harder to get a return on his vehicle investment without CarSync. “From what I have seen, people are looking at other platforms and even trying to do private rentals,” said Navarro when asked if he thought hosts would leave Turo for one of its competitors, like Getaround. “But Turo is still the largest platform and so I think that people will either try to make it work or they will try to exit the business.” Navarro said large fleets might be able to adapt, but people like him with a medium-sized fleet who do Turo on the side will start contemplating if they want to stay in this business at all. “For me, it is a hard time to exit because of how much the used Tesla market has dropped and what I still owe. But after the summer, I might re-evaluate,” he said. A letter to Turo signed by Tesla Turo United, a collective of Turo power and all-star hosts who own Teslas, shared similar sentiments, saying that CarSync offers more reliable and varied automated messages than Turo’s messaging system. The letter, which TechCrunch viewed, also says CarSync completely automates Supercharger reimbursements, a tool that’s not “merely a helpful tool for us, it is basically a necessity.” Without that tool, they have to manually copy and paste Supercharger costs from the Tesla app, which the letter describes as “a soul-draining, time-wasting process.” “CarSync’s magic is that it integrates with both Tesla and Turo, enabling CarSync to draw the Supercharger expenses from Tesla, format an invoice, and with the press of only one button, we can send the invoice and receipts to our guests after their trip,” the letter reads. “As Power & All-Star Hosts dealing with hundreds of trips, we don’t have the time and bandwidth to operate our businesses without automation of these Supercharger expenses. Along the same lines, CarSync makes it super simple to automate collection of toll reimbursements and related receipts.” CarSync has also recently integrated with Lula to offer an insurance product that insures vehicles “when not on a guest trip,” which has been helpful for hosts’ auto loans. Turo has not shared plans to provide its own insurance platform for hosts. CarSync said it was disappointed by Turo’s decision, “especially given that Turo is a peer-to-peer sharing network, this goes against the openness and collaboration that is in the spirit of P2P,” said Mihajlovic, who noted that Airbnb works to promote external partners through its developer program. CarSync was founded in 2019 specifically with the car-sharing business in mind, and now plans to pivot and focus on helping companies that rent cars to Uber drivers manage their fleets. “Still, given that we have built a brand and have a loyal user base, we are also thinking of a product to continue the CarSync brand and provide fleet management functionalities to smaller fleets,” said Mihajlovic. “It definitely hurts given that our ‘free’ business model was starting to work and we were scaling like crazy, however lessons are learned and we’re moving on.” Fleetwire, another popular third-party service, offers hosts a way to list all of their Turo vehicles on a user-friendly website that directs renters back to Turo. TechCrunch was unable to reach Fleetwire for comment."
104,Box is partnering with OpenAI to bring generative AI tools across the platform,['@ron_miller'],"May 2, 2023","We’ve seen a number of enterprise software companies making announcements related to generative AI in the last six weeks, from established companies like Salesforce and Adobe to startups like Ada and Forethought. Box is the latest to be announcing its own flavor of the technology under the moniker Box AI, and it will be teaming up with OpenAI to deliver the first tools on the platform. Like many of the other companies making these announcements, they don’t have a product quite ready yet, but they are working with early customers to refine the functionality they have built in recent months. The company chose to call this Box AI because the two features being announced today are part of a much broader product road map of AI being added to the platform in the coming months. Box CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie says that on one hand, the new AI features will help generate more content, but the real strength is helping people understand that content. “These large language models are uniquely good at reasoning through content. And so a lot of the use cases that we’re excited about are actually ones where you can use the large language model, not as the database of knowledge, but as a reasoning engine to work through your data,” Levie told TechCrunch. For now the company is focusing on a couple of use cases in its initial announcement. For starters, you can click the Box AI button and ask questions of a document like, “Summarize this document for me,” or “What are five key points about this document?” And Box’s generative AI will provide an answer. This could come in handy for long reports or complex contracts. In this example, you can ask Box AI about the details of this agreement. Image Credits: Box In this example, you can ask Box AI about the details of this agreement. Image Credits: Box Being able to iterate over a document and ask increasingly specific questions means that you can produce content like a quiz or summary and the AI should be able to improve as you ask more questions. The other thing you can do is create new content in Box Notes. Say, you create 10 bullet points from a meeting about a new product. You could ask Box AI to make a blog post out of that list and it can do it pretty much instantly, working in a similar way to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s generalized generative AI tool. The company is working closely with customers to refine these tools and Levie says that in time, you will be able to analyze multiple documents with refinements like the maximum age a document can be. Over time, you will also be able to build automated workflows, but these elements are on the product roadmap and are not part of this announcement. Although, the company is working with OpenAI API for starters, the idea is to be flexible enough to accommodate any large language model, or even alternative model types that could develop over time. Levie says he’s announcing these products now, even prior to beta, because he’s been getting a constant stream of questions from customers about the company’s plans for generative AI and he wants them to know what’s coming.

On with the news! — Christine Meal replacement startup Yfood did a thing today. Ingrid reports that Nestlé closed on an acquisition of the company in a deal that values Yfood at $469 million. She writes, “Yfood’s milestone should give the food tech community something substantial to chew on. The intersection of tech and food has been playing out as a theme in the world of startups for years, with technologists and entrepreneurs bringing a hacking mentality to the field to take new approaches to sourcing, preparing, selling and distributing things to eat and drink.” Meanwhile, Canaan closed two new funds — its 12th flagship fund for early-stage tech and healthcare startups and an opportunity fund — that total $850 million. That opportunity fund might be raising some eyebrows, with Connie writing, “Some institutional investors privately grouse that they don’t like later-stage funds hosted by early-stage investors, as it complicates their ability to properly diversify their own investments.” Connie notes that the market might be slowing, but venture capital firms are continuing to amass big funds, as we also saw S2G Ventures do today. Now here’s five more for you: Image Credits: Overearth / Getty Images Image Credits: Overearth / Getty Images America’s long-standing wealth gap between white and Black households contributes to the lack of diversity among startup founders. Median liquid wealth for a Black family in the U.S. is $3,630, but that figure soars to $79,000 for a white family. As a result, “the average Black founder raises less than around $1,000 from family and friends,” reports Dominic-Madori Davis. Since the average friends and family round is $23,000, “they’d need to secure the entire liquid wealth of six Black families,” according to a white paper by venture fund Fifth Star.

106,"Cabify, the Madrid-based Uber rival, says it’s raised $110M",['@ingridlunden'],"March 28, 2023","It’s 2023, and we’re years past the peak of monster fundraising for on-demand transportation and delivery startups locked in highly competitive races with each other to dominate urban consumer mobility. But with many of the biggest and most tenacious players still in the market, those rounds have not disappeared altogether. Today, Cabify, a Madrid-based platform that competes against Uber in Spain and Latin America, said it has picked up $110 million in funding, which it plans to use in part to expand in its existing footprint, expand its technology stack, and bring more electric vehicles into its fleet. The company currently has over 42 million registered users and 1.2 million drivers across eight markets that include cities in Spain such as Madrid and Barcelona as well as cities in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Spain, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. It says its plan is to triple revenues in the next three years while expanding to 25 more urban centers with populations of over 200,000. The funding is a mix of equity and debt, the company tells me. The equity comes from Orilla Asset Management (the family office for Francisco Riberas, who is one of the major shareholders of Gestamp, a Spanish automotive manufacturing giant), financial services giant AXIS (via its Fond-ICO Next Tech), and others that are not being named. But we don’t have an idea of the exact amount of new funding: the $110 million also includes a €40 million loan from the European Investment Bank actually announced in December 2022, and it also includes the proceeds of a funding round of an unconfirmed amount that Cabify secured in July 2022. Cabify also did not respond to a question about its valuation. PitchBook notes that the investment in July 2022 valued the company at $1.49 billion, so that is the last stated amount. However, for some context on that number — and an example of the pressure that startups are under right now with a higher “cost of capital” than before — when Cabify raised $160 million back in 2018 (a high-water moment for those kinds of outsized funding rounds), it had a valuation of $1.4 billion. The company has a pretty large cap table underneath that figure: PitchBook lists no less than 33 current investors (plus another 13 investors that have since sold their shares). The list of active backers include the likes of Rakuten (the Japanese “Amazon” that has used Spain as the home base for its European efforts), Endeavor Capital and the Winkelvoss twins. Cabify’s fundraising underscores the fact that while regulators may not be holding as many of these transportation companies to account as they were previously, and consumers may not buzz about them as much as they did pre-COVID, they are continuing to grow, and specifically, are raising money in a tight capital market to continue investing in their growth. Cabify is not disclosing revenue numbers, nor whether it is actually profitable in any single market or overall, but it said that it is growing. In 2021, the company followed the example of Uber and others in the market, expanding into offering “multi-modal” services, specifically subscriptions across multiple forms of transportation. It also added grocery deliveries to its app. That has resulted in rising revenues, too: Cabify notes that “turnover in 2022 is already 24% higher than in 2019, and 32% higher than in 2021.” Cabify told me that global turnover for 2021 was $518 million, which would mean that the estimated figure for 2022 is $683.8 million (it also means that 2021 was still not back to 2019 levels). “This commitment from strategic investors is a recognition of Cabify’s positive impact and potential to continue creating long-term value for our investors and the cities in which we operate,” said Juan de Antonio, CEO of Cabify, in a statement. “These are partners who share our vision for the sustainable mobility industry and will enable us to accelerate the delivery of our strategic plan.” The electric vehicle strategy will come in a few phases that follow on from a goal the company set itself for all trips to become zero-emmission by 2025 in Spain, and by 2030 globally. The EIB loan, which was earmarked for this effort, is being used to roll out 1,400 electric vehicles and charging stations in Spain. The latest on this front is a call for tenders the company will make this year to acquire vehicles and charging infrastructure. (Cabify works with drivers who have their own vehicles, but it has also built out its own fleet, Vecttor, which operates in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla y Málaga, and is 95% “eco or zero” labeled.) It also signed a deal with Fenie Energia, an independent marketer of electricity, gas and energy efficiency solutions, “to promote the installation and implementation of recharging points throughout Spain to accelerate the electrification of vehicles of taxi drivers and self-employed drivers that use Cabify.” That will include discounts to drivers to install charging points. Updated with revenue figures provided by Cabify."

If you read nothing else today, read The Great Pretender by Devin. It’s a great piece that looks into AI and how it (sometimes/mostly/theoretically) works: “All that matters is that these systems do not distinguish between something that is correct and something that looks correct.

108,The robots are already here,['@bheater'],"April 6, 2023","In a blog post published last week, Meta asks, “Where are the robots?” The answer is simple. They’re here. You just need to know where to look. It’s a frustrating answer. I recognize that. Let’s set aside conversations about cars and driver assistance and just focus on things we all tend to agree are robots. For starters, that Amazon delivery isn’t making it to you without robotic assistance. A more pertinent question would be: Why aren’t there more robots? And more to the point, why aren’t there more robots in my house right now? It’s a complex question with a lot of nuance — much of it coming down to the current state of hardware limitations around the concept of a “general purpose” robot. Roomba is a robot. There are a lot of Roombas in the world, and that’s largely because Roombas do one thing well (an additional decade of R&D has helped advance things from a state of “pretty good”). It’s not so much that the premise of the question is flawed — it’s more a question of reframing it slightly. “Why aren’t there more robots?” is a perfectly valid question for a nonroboticist to ask. As a longtime hardware person, I usually start my answer there. I’ve had enough conversations over the past decade that I feel fairly confident I could monopolize the entire conversation discussing the many potential points of failure with a robot gripper. Meta’s take is software-based, and that’s fair enough. Over the past few years, I’ve witnessed an explosion in startups tackling various important categories like robotic learning, deployment/management and no- and low-code solutions. An evergreen shoutout here to the nearly two decades of research and development that’s gone into creating, maintaining and improving ROS. Fittingly, longtime stewards Open Robotics was acquired by Alphabet, which has been doing its own work in the category through the homegrown efforts, Intrinsic and Everyday Robots (which albeit were disproportionately impacted by org-wide resource slashing). Meta/Facebook no doubt does its own share of skunkworks projects that surface every so often. I’ve seen nothing so far to suggest that they’re on a scale with what Alphabet/Google has explored over the years, but it’s always interesting to see some of these projects peek their heads out. In an announcement I strongly suspect is tied to the proliferation of generative AI discussions, the social media giant has shared what it calls “two major advancements toward general-purpose embodied AI agents capable of performing challenging sensorimotor skills.” Quoting directly here: An artificial visual cortex (called VC-1): a single perception model that, for the first time, supports a diverse range of sensorimotor skills, environments, and embodiments. VC-1 is trained on videos of people performing everyday tasks from the groundbreaking Ego4D dataset created by Meta AI and academic partners. And VC-1 matches or outperforms best-known results on 17 different sensorimotor tasks in virtual environments. A new approach called adaptive (sensorimotor) skill coordination (ASC), which achieves near-perfect performance (98 percent success) on the challenging task of robotic mobile manipulation (navigating to an object, picking it up, navigating to another location, placing the object, repeating) in physical environments. Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta Interesting research, no doubt, and I’m excited to potentially drill down on some of this, moving forward. The phrase “general purpose” is getting tossed around a lot these days. It’s a perpetually interesting topic of conversation in robotics, but there’s been a massive proliferation of general-purpose humanoid robots coming out of the woodwork in the wake of the Tesla bot unveil. For years, people have told me things like, “Say what you will about Musk, but Tesla has driven renewed interest in EVs,” and that’s more or less how I feel about Optimus at the moment. It’s served an import dual role of renewing the discussion around the form factor, while providing a clear visual to point to when explaining how hard this stuff is. Is it possible to dramatically raise the public’s expectations while tempering them at the same time? Again, those conversations dovetail nicely with all of these GPT breakthroughs. This stuff is all very impressive, but Rodney Brooks put the danger of conflating things quite well in this very newsletter a few weeks back: “I think people are overly optimistic. They’re mistaking performance for competence. You see a good performance in a human, you can say what they’re competent at. We’re pretty good at modeling people, but those same models don’t apply. You see a great performance from one of these systems, but it doesn’t tell you how it’s going to work in adjacent space all around that, or with different data.” Image Credits: Covariant Image Credits: Covariant Obviously, I didn’t let that stop me from asking most of the folks I spoke to at ProMat for their takes on generative AI’s future role in robotics. The answers were . . . wide ranging. Some shrug it off, others see a very regimented role for the tech, and others still are extremely bullish about what all of this means for the future. In last week’s newsletter, Peter Chen, the CEO of Covariant (who just raised a fresh $75 million), offered some interesting context when it comes to generalized AI: Before the recent ChatGPT, there were a lot of natural language processing AIs out there. Search, translate, sentiment detection, spam detection — there were loads of natural language AIs out there. The approach before GPT is, for each use case, you train a specific AI to it, using a smaller subset of data. Look at the results now, and GPT basically abolishes the field of translation, and it’s not even trained to translation. The foundation model approach is basically, instead of using small amounts of data that’s specific to one situation or train a model that’s specific to one circumstance, let’s train a large foundation-generalized model on a lot more data, so the AI is more generalized. Of course, Covariant is currently hyper-focused on picking and placing. It’s frankly a big enough challenge to keep them occupied for a long time. But one of the promises systems like this offer is real-world training. Companies that actually have real robots doing real jobs in the real world are building extremely powerful databases and models around how machines interact with the world around them (the walls of a research facility can be limiting in this respect). It’s not hard to see how many of the seemingly disparate building blocks being fortified by researchers and companies alike might one day come together to create a truly general-purpose system. When the hardware and AI are at that level, there’s going to be a seemingly bottomless trove of field data to train them on. I’ll admit that I did a little bit of robotic roster mixing and matching on the floor at ProMat, trying to determine how close we are given the current state of commercially available technology. For the time being, the platform approach makes a lot of sense. With Spot, for example, Boston Dynamics is effectively selling customers on an iPhone model. First you produce gen one of an impressive piece of hardware. Next you offer an SDK to interested parties. If things go as planned, you’ve suddenly got this product doing things your team never imagined. Assuming that doesn’t involve mounting a gun to the back of the product (per BD’s guidelines), that’s an exciting proposition. Image Credits: 1X Image Credits: 1X It’s way too early to say anything definite about 1X Technologies’ NEO robot, beyond the fact that the firm is clearly hoping to live right in that cross section between robotics and generative AI. Certainly it has a powerful ally in OpenAI. The generative AI giant’s Startup Fund led a $23.5 million round, which also featured Tiger Global, among others. Says 1X founder and CEO Bernt Øivind Børnich, “1X is thrilled to have OpenAI lead this round because we’re aligned in our missions: thoughtfully integrating emerging technology into people’s daily lives. With the support of our investors, we will continue to make significant strides in the field of robotics and augment the global labor market.” This is how Optimus and Neo look currently. pic.twitter.com/JG2m9LUz3i — Brian Heater (@bheater) April 5, 2023  One interesting note on that (to me at least) is that 1X has actually been kicking around for a minute. The Norwegian firm was known as Halodi until its very recent (exactly one month ago) pithy rebrand. You only have to go back a year or two to see the beginnings take on the humanoid form factor the company was developing for food service. The tech definitely appears more sophisticated than its 2021 counterpart, but the wheeled-base betrays how much further is left to go to get to some version of the robot we see if its renders. Incidentally, maybe it’s me, but there seems to be some convergent evolution happening here: Image Credits: Tesla/Figure/IX — Collage by the author Image Credits: Tesla/Figure/IX — Collage by the author Top to bottom, these are renders of Tesla Optimus, Figure 01, and 1X Neo. Not direct copies, obviously, but they certainly look like they could be cousins. Neo is the one that insists on wearing a hoodie, even to formal occasions. Listen, I’m not an industrial designer, but what about a cowboy hat or something? Image Credits: MIT CSAIL Image Credits: MIT CSAIL What say we finish off the week of news with a pair of research projects? The first is a fun one out of MIT. When you really think about it, playing soccer is a great way to test locomotion. There’s a reason the Robocup has been kicking for nearly 20 years. In the case of Dribblebot, however, the challenge is uneven terrain — that includes stuff like grass, mud and sand. Says MIT professor Pulkit Agrawal: If you look around today, most robots are wheeled. But imagine that there’s a disaster scenario, flooding, or an earthquake, and we want robots to aid humans in the search and rescue process. We need the machines to go over terrains that aren’t flat, and wheeled robots can’t traverse those landscapes. The whole point of studying legged robots is to go to terrains outside the reach of current robotic systems. Image Credits: UCLA Image Credits: UCLA The second research project is from UCLA’s Samueli School of Engineering, which recently published findings from its work around origami robots. The Origami MechanoBots, or “OrigaMechs,” rely on sensors embedded into their thin polyester building blocks. Principal investigator Ankur Mehta has some fairly far out plans for the tech. “These types of dangerous or unpredictable scenarios, such as during a natural or manmade disaster, could be where origami robots proved to be especially useful,” he said in a post tied to the news. “The robots could be designed for specialty functions and manufactured on demand very quickly. Also, while it’s a very long way away, there could be environments on other planets where explorer robots that are impervious to those scenarios would be very desirable.” It’s not quite the surface of Venus, but the prey-sensing flytrap is pretty neat nonetheless. All right, how about a fresh round of job listings? I plan to continue doing these periodically in chunks, going forward. The best way to get listed is to follow me over on LinkedIn and respond on threads where I announce a new job is coming up. This is certainly not the most efficient way to do it, but it’s been working for me, so I’m going to stay the course. As I mentioned this week, I’m going to prioritize those who haven’t been featured before.

109,Chinese luxury EV brand Zeekr will expand to Europe by end of 2023,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 18, 2023","Zeekr, the premium electric vehicle brand under China’s Geely Automobile Holdings, has confirmed plans to expand into Europe this year. The company will begin selling its Zeekr 001 luxury shooting brake and Zeekr X urban SUV in Sweden and the Netherlands starting in the fourth quarter of 2023, with plans to expand quickly to other European countries after that, the company said Tuesday at Auto Shanghai 2023. The news isn’t exactly a surprise, but it is significant given the fact that Zeekr is only two years old. Since launching in 2021, the automaker has sold over 93,000 units, mainly its flagship Zeekr 001, and has added two new vehicles to its lineup — the Zeekr X, which launched in China last week, and the Zeekr 009 minivan. The 001 and X compete directly with Tesla’s Model Y crossover in an increasingly cutthroat EV market in China. The 001, which can deliver a range of around 375 miles, costs around RMB 300,000 ($44,000). The X has a range of 348 miles and costs around RMB 190,000 ($27,600). Zeekr’s vehicles also include over-the-air software updates. Part of Zeekr’s success in China has been its direct-to-consumer business model, which the company aims to bring to Europe as well. Tesla popularized D2C sales, which sidestep the traditional model of selling cars through franchised dealerships. The push into Europe follows Zeekr’s February fundraise of $750 million at a $13 billion valuation. The company has also been aggressively hiring in more than 30 cities around the world, including in Gothenburg, Sweden, which is where Zeekr houses its Global Design Center and European R&D center. In fact, the automaker says its European team is already composed of more than 1,500 engineers and designers. Zeekr’s European headquarters will be based in Amsterdam, the company said. Spiros Fotinos, who spent over two decades with Toyota and led brand management of Lexus globally, will lead the charge as CEO of Zeekr Europe. Zeekr has not shared plans to bring its EVs to the U.S., but the company confidentially filed for an IPO in December. Zeekr did not respond in time to TechCrunch’s queries on the status of that IPO."
110,"Britive, which helps secure public clouds, lands $20.5M investment",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 23, 2023","Proving that there’s still plenty of venture money in cybersecurity, cloud identity security platform Britive today announced that it raised $20.5 million in a Series B funding round. Led by Pelion Venture Partners with participation from Liberty Global Ventures, Crosslink Capital and One Way Ventures, the new brings Britive’s total raised to $36 million. CEO Art Poghosyan says that it’ll be put toward expanding the company’s investments in customer successes, marketing and sales, as well as product development. “Ironically, the pandemic affected Britive’s business more positively than not,” Poghosyan told TechCrunch in an email interview. “It accelerated the move to virtualizing work environments and transition from data center to cloud.” There’s truth to that. According to a 2022 survey from Equinix, 71% of IT decision-makers plan to move more functions to the cloud over the next 12 months. The cloud has plenty of upsides, among them scalability and accessibility. But there are drawbacks, too — one being security (potentially). A poll from the Cloud Security Alliance reveals that close to one-third of businesses using a public cloud provider experienced security issues within the past two years, including unauthorized apps and poorly configured APIs. Poghosyan says that Britive was built to address those cloud security concerns — particularly on the identity and access management (IAM) side. Founded in 2018, the startup’s platform generates access privileges — including tokens and keys — on demand for people and software accessing cloud services and apps. “Our tech automatically expires and removes privileges when not in use to ensure the cloud keys and tokens are not exposed to attacks around the clock,” Poghosyan said. “Britive’s offering allows development teams to continue building at cloud speed while security teams maintain full visibility and control over cloud identities and privileges. Britive is far from the only player in the vast and growing IAM market, though. There’s well-capitalized ventures like Saviynt, whose platform enables companies to secure apps, data and infrastructure in a single platform. Private equity firm Thoma Bravo paid billions to acquire identity access management startups SailPoint, Ping Identity and ForgeRock. On the less grandiose end of the spectrum, there are ventures like ConductorOne, which aims to bring automation to identity and access management. Poghosyan asserts that Britive’s anomaly-spotting AI differentiates it from the others out there. Using AI, Britive analyzes cloud user activity logs in near-real time and attempts to identify behavioral patterns that could be dangerous or unauthorized. The platform then alerts the relevant security teams, giving them the option to quickly terminate any potentially problematic sessions. TechCrunch can’t speak to Britive’s efficacy. But the company’s growth suggests there’s something there. Poghosyan says that annual recurring revenue is in the “millions” of dollars and growing 3x annually, and that Britive now has “dozens” of customers, including several Fortune 500 brands. “Our platform manages thousands of daily active privileged identities who interact with critical business applications and infrastructure hosted on major cloud platforms,” Poghosyan added. “Even in a broader climate of economic slowdown, enterprise organizations continue to invest in future-proofing their cloud infrastructure and security solutions stack, which Britive is an essential part of.” Britive, which currently has about 55 employees, expects to add 10 to 20 staffers by the end of the year, Poghosyan said."
111,Rocket Lab reveals big supplier deal with mystery mega constellation customer,['@breadfrom'],"March 24, 2023","Rocket Lab has proven that it’s much more than a launch company. One glance at the company’s most recent earnings presentation shows as much: its space systems business, which designs, manufactures and sells satellite components and spacecraft, brought in over 70% of company revenue compared to launch in 2022, at $150.3 million versus $60.7 million, respectively. The space systems business — whose products include star trackers, reaction wheels, solar power systems, separation systems and more — also saw a massive growth in revenue, increasing by 239% year-over-year. To meet this growing demand, the company further announced last year that it was building out new manufacturing capabilities for reaction wheels, in particular. The investment is paying off: It appears that Rocket Lab has landed a contract to provide reaction wheels to an unnamed mega constellation customer. The company said as much in a February press release announcing a new 12Nms reaction wheel product, saying that the wheel is “currently planned for flight with an undisclosed large mega constellation customer.” More recently, Rocket Lab CFO Adam Spice added more color to this statement, revealing that the deal is worth “thousands” of reaction wheels per year. “We entered into an agreement with a mega constellation where it’s thousands of reaction wheels per year and much bigger reaction wheels,” Spice said at Cowen’s 44th Annual Aerospace/Defense and Industrials Conference in February. “What that allowed us to do is build a dedicated high-volume production facility in New Zealand and we brought the cost down by almost an order of magnitude on those wheels.” At a Bank of America event this Tuesday, Spice reiterated the enormity of the deal: “We secured a contract with a mega constellation customer where we’ll ship two or three thousand reaction wheels per year to one customer.” While the company has not publicly disclosed the name of this customer — and declined to comment on the matter to TechCrunch, citing commercial sensitivity — there’s only a handful of known possibilities. Amazon’s Project Kuiper is one likely candidate, and OneWeb’s growing network could plausibly be another. SpaceX has demonstrated that it wants to stay in-house as much as possible for its production stack, however, so Starlink isn’t likely. In its data sheet on the 12Nms reaction wheel, Rocket Lab lists the base price at $100,000. Of course, on contracts of this size, the price per unit is often discounted (which Spice acknowledged, saying at the Cowen conference that the ASP for the mega constellation reaction wheels “came down quite a bit”), but it suggests a big win for Rocket Lab’s revenues and a possible source for the doubling of the company’s backlog last year: from $241 million at the end of 2021 to $503 million."
112,Ambani and James Murdoch bring HBO content to India,['@refsrc'],"April 27, 2023","Warner Bros. Discovery has partnered with Mukesh Ambani-backed Viacom18 to bring HBO and other movies and shows from the WB catalog to India in a major win for the Reliance joint venture’s service that is aggressively winning mindshare from rivals including Disney’s Hotstar, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. HBO Original, Max Original and a selection of Warner Bros. television series will debut on Reliance’s JioCinema next month, with streaming occurring simultaneously with the U.S., according to a joint statement from Warner Bros. and Viacom18. JioCinema’s “exclusive” content agreement comes as the platform has attracted tens of millions of users in recent weeks, driven by free streaming of the IPL cricket tournament for anyone with internet access. In 2022, Viacom18 outbid Disney to secure five years of IPL streaming rights for the Indian subcontinent, at a cost of $3 billion. Viacom18, a joint venture between Reliance and Paramount Global, also counts former Star executives Uday Shankar and James Murdoch’s Bodhi Tree among its backers. Earlier this month, Bodhi Tree reduced its planned investment in Viacom18 to $528 million, a 70% decrease from the initial commitment of $1.78 billion. Bodhi Tree plans to increase its stake in Viacom18, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Reliance, which holds a majority stake in Viacom18, announced earlier this month that it would contribute $1.32 billion to the joint venture, a significant increase from the originally planned $216 million. Thursday’s announcement deals a blow to Disney, as its Hotstar app gained traction through cricket’s popularity and premium content from HBO. The platform has since lost both the offerings. The licensing agreement with Warner Bros., estimated to cost Viacom18 over $15 million annually, highlights Ambani’s growing efforts to establish JioCinema as a dominant streamer platform in India’s otherwise crowded market. Despite being included at no additional charge for all Jio subscribers, JioCinema, part of telecom behemoth Jio Platform’s content offerings, had previously struggled to attract customers. In addition to the major investments, JioCinema has poached aggressively from Hotstar in recent months. The firm recently also appointed former Disney executive Kevin Vaz as Viacom18 CEO.   “JioCinema has become the biggest platform for live sports. We are now on a mission to build the most magnetic destination for entertainment for all Indians,” said Ferzad Palia, Head – SVOD & International Business, Viacom18, in a statement. “The strategic partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery is a big milestone in our journey to offer the best of Hollywood content to our elite consumers. We believe that Warner Bros. Discovery sets the global standards for premium content and this partnership allows us to create the best and the most comprehensive destination for our users.” Industry analysts were widely expecting Amazon, which offers a number of on-demand video streaming services in India, to tie-up with Warner Bros. for HBO content in the South Asian market. Amazon is also currently in advanced stages of deliberations to acquire MX Player, a popular video streaming service in India, TechCrunch reported earlier. With the new content deal in place,  JioCinema is gradually positioning itself to potentially introduce a paid model for accessing select premium content. In Viacom18, Warner Bros. has also found a deeply-pocketed partner in India. The New York-headquartered media giant has scaled back many of its operations in South Asia in recent years, including discontinuing HBO and WB TV channels in India, Pakistan, Maldives and Bangladesh."
113,Revolut’s valuation troubles signal a stormy horizon for less-profitable neobanks,"['Alex Wilhelm', 'Anna Heim']","April 26, 2023","While the banking world watches American lender First Republic publicly convulse after its earnings report detailed a widespread evaporation of its deposit base, the startup world of neobanks is taking blows as well. Earlier this week, Revolut, a highly valued, U.K.-based neobank saw its valuation decline by some 46% in the eyes of one of its backers. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Given that Revolut last raised $800 million at a $33 billion valuation in mid-2021, it stands to reason that it was likely overvalued at the time — show us a nine-figure startup round from those times that fits neatly against today’s valuation marks and we’ll buy you a smoothie. But Revolut getting such a sharp valuation cut nearly two years after it was last priced made us sit up and take notice. There was a time when the “neobank for X” market was amongst the most popular startup models, after all. Mountains of capital were invested into dozens of global startups looking to reinvent or at least revamp consumer and SMB banking. It even led to some liquidity, including the massive Nubank IPO and its resulting 11-figure valuation. Revolut’s revaluation raises a few questions: How much trimming is there left to do in the fintech world? And, are we likely to see something similar more generally in the neobanking startup sector? A Revolut spokesperson said: We do not engage in speculation on our valuation. Since our last funding round, in which we were valued at $33 billion, Revolut has continued to perform strongly in all its markets, has continued to hire and expand, and reported its first full year of profitability. This morning, we’re parsing what happened in venture in Q1 2023 as well as a handful of data points from F-Prime’s fintech index and resulting reports. Then, we’ll cover the most recent neobank financial results we have and come to a conclusion on how much pain — or how little — neobanks can expect in the months ahead. To work!   We have fintech funding data from CB Insights for Q1 2023, but it comes with a huge asterisk. Without additional context, funding to fintech startups increased 55% from the fourth quarter of 2022, making for a global tally of $15 billion. The caveat, though, is that Stripe’s latest $6.5 billion raise alone accounted for more than a third of that sum. If you exclude that round, the tally comes down to $8.5 billion, which represents a 12% quarter-on-quarter decline. That’s the big picture. Looking at the fintech cohort more closely, we are curious about which categories outperformed others. Data of that kind on private companies is hard to come by, but we have some interesting insights on public companies."

115,"This Week in Apps: Users pan Snapchat’s AI, Bluesky has a moment, Apple wins antitrust appeal",['@sarahintampa'],"April 29, 2023","Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app economy in 2023 hit a few snags, as consumer spending last year dropped for the first time by 2% to $167 billion, according to data.ai’s “State of Mobile” report. However, downloads are continuing to grow, up 11% year-over-year in 2022 to reach 255 billion. Consumers are also spending more time in mobile apps than ever before. On Android devices alone, hours spent in 2022 grew 9%, reaching 4.1 trillion. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.

/ Getty Images If anyone was waiting for a winner to emerge among the many Twitter alternatives, current signs are pointing to Bluesky as a possible forerunner in the race. With its invite-only status, native mobile apps and ability to attract the always online, shitposting crowd, the app has been getting buzz this past week as users invited their friends, bringing the network to somewhere around 40,000+ users. Bluesky today moves quickly, giving posters the dopamine rush of Twitter-level attention at times. People are vying to reach to its “What’s Hot” feed and are arguing about whether or not these pseudo-tweets should be called “posts” or “skeets” — the latter against the wishes of the CEO Jay Graber, who is begging for anything else, even “skoots.” To what extent she’ll have any sway over the matter remains to be seen. In one viral post, Graber essentially admits the users are now running amok. Image Credits: Bluesky screenshot Image Credits: Bluesky screenshot Blueskyers are also creating their own conventions for the site, dubbing the Bluesky “timeline” the “skyline,” for example, and are laughing about Elon Musk’s failures while posting their Bluesky memes. Much of the crowd is young — ranging from Gen Z to millennial — and some have been known to joke about their plan to bully cringey Gen X’ers or any unwelcome bad actors off the app if they ever dare to join. This experience, naturally, is not for everyone. Despite there being a number of journalists on Bluesky, it’s so far not a place where people are sharing their work or having thoughtful discussions about the news of the day. There aren’t many (any?) right-wingers getting into arguments with leftists. There are few legit celebs or high-profile figures on board, beyond folks like Chrissy Teigen and AOC and a few others. Instead, Bluesky feels like a weird afterparty where everyone is a little too drunk, a little too tired and has lost their filter. This vibe may not last and neither may its appeal. It remains to be seen. While “party Twitter” is a fun place to be for a time, it isn’t necessarily a fulfilling meal — just a sugary snack. That could leave some people returning to more robust networks, like Twitter or Mastodon to engage in more thoughtful discussions. And it may turn off some potential Bluesky users who aren’t a fan of the shitposting culture. For others, however, a place that’s all brouhaha and no baggage may be just what they want. There are also things the app needs to address before it opens more publicly. For now, it’s lacking many of the features people expect — like the ability to view your past likes, bookmark items, create lists, block users, use hashtags, DM others, perform advanced searches and more. This gives the network a bit of an ephemeral feeling, as posts — or skeets — quickly move down the feed, never to be seen again. Despite its issues, Bluesky recalls the early days of the social web where trying new apps was actually fun. That’s the nature of its invite-only status, which is keeping the party small with a bouncer at the door. In the meantime, if you want to join us on Bluesky, give us a follow.

Currently, Bluesky has 245,000 downloads on iOS, more than half of which came in April, indicating there’s far more demand than there is access for the time being. Image Credits: Snap (modified by TechCrunch) Image Credits: Snap (modified by TechCrunch) The user reviews for Snapchat’s “My AI” feature are in — and they’re not good. Launched last week to global users after initially being a subscriber-only addition, Snapchat’s new AI chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology is now pinned to the top of the app’s Chat tab where users can ask it questions and get instant responses. But following the chatbot’s rollout to Snapchat’s wider community, Snapchat’s app has seen a spike in negative reviews amid a growing number of complaints shared on social media. Over the past week, Snapchat’s average U.S. App Store review was 1.67, with 75% of reviews being one-star, according to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. For comparison, across Q1 2023, the Snapchat average U.S. App Store review was 3.05, with only 35% of reviews being one-star. The number of daily reviews has also increased by five times over the last week, the firm noted. Another app data provider, Apptopia, reports a similar trend. Its analysis shows “AI” was the top keyword in Snapchat’s App Store reviews over the past seven days, where it was mentioned 2,973 times. The firm has given the term an “Impact Score” rating of -9.2. This Impact Score is a weighted index that measures the effect a term has on sentiment and ranges from -10 to +10. Apptopia also said that Snapchat received around 3x more one-star ratings than usual on April 20, 2023. That’s the day after the My AI global release was announced. Many Snapchat users aren’t thrilled with My AI, which appeared inside their app without warning or their consent. For some, it’s the chatbot’s placement that’s the cause of concern. My AI is pinned to the top of users’ Chat feed inside the app and can’t be unpinned, blocked or removed, as other conversations can be. Many are also pushing back at the fact that removing the My AI from their Chat feed requires a Snapchat+ subscription — effectively forcing them to pay to get their app back to normal. Other users found the AI creepy, as it seemed to know their location even if they hadn’t explicitly shared it. In response to the ongoing complaints, Snap published an explainer. It said the AI would have your location data if you were already using Snap Map and if you disabled location sharing, there could be a temporary delay (due to caching, we understand) before the AI would no longer have access to that data. Snap also said it made updates to My AI that clarify when it is aware of a Snapchatter’s location, and when it isn’t. Now, when users open My AI for the first time, they’ll receive a notice explaining that it may use the information they share with Snapchat to personalize its responses.   Image Credits: Nicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty Images Image Credits: Nicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty Images Apple this week won its antitrust-focused appeals court battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games over its App Store policies, according to the opinion issued today by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court largely upheld the district court’s earlier ruling related to Epic Games’ antitrust claims in favor of Apple, but it also upheld the lower court’s judgment in favor of Epic under California’s Unfair Competition Law. The ruling is a major setback for Epic Games and other developers who hoped the ruling could set a precedent for further antitrust claims and require Apple to open iOS devices to third-party app stores and payment systems. However, the one bright spot for developers is that the ruling upheld the lower court’s prior decision on anti-steering changes. Noted Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney: “Fortunately, the court’s positive decision rejecting Apple’s anti-steering provisions frees iOS developers to send consumers to the web to do business with them directly there. We’re working on next steps.”   In addition to Apple, Meta also won an antitrust lawsuit, under appeal, that had pitted the tech giant against dozens of state attorneys general, led by New York. The states alleged Meta had illegally maintained monopoly power in the social networking market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, and that it gained further power through data policies that harmed app developers. The U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg originally ruled that states had waited too long to challenge Meta’s acquisitions and that the policies they had cited were not illegal under antitrust law. The appeals court upheld this decision.

Image Credits: Yelp Image Credits: Yelp     Image Credits: Runway Image Credits: Runway The AI startup Runway, which helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, launched its first mobile app this week, giving users access to Gen-1, its video-to-video generative AI model. The app allows users to be able to record a video from their phones and generate an AI video in minutes as well as transform any existing video in their library by using text prompts, images or style presets. Plus, users can select from a list of presets like “Cloudscape,” or transform their video to look like it’s a claymation, charcoal sketch, watercolor art, paper origami and more, TechCrunch’s Lauren Forristal reported, or they can upload an image or type an idea into the text box. The app is currently iOS-only and has paid subscriptions. The Standard ($143.99/year) plan offers 625 credits/month and other premium features like 1080p video, unlimited projects and more. The Pro ($344.99/year) plan offers 2,250 credits/month and all of Runway’s 30+ AI tools.   Image Credits: Petey Image Credits: Petey Petey, the mobile app that introduced ChatGPT to Apple Watch users, recently brought its feature set to the iPhone, allowing users to access its AI assistant more quickly and even swap out Siri with Petey using Apple’s Shortcuts. Now, Petey has a new trick up its sleeve. In its latest update, out today, the app can be connected to Apple Music, so it can make playlists for you or help you add individual songs to your Apple Music library. The new feature arrives alongside several other updates, including the ability to access the latest AI model, GPT-4, through a paid “Petey Premium” subscription. To get Petey’s music recommendations, you simply type your request for a playlist into the app’s interface. The app then lines up short previews of each recommended song below the returned playlist allowing you to scroll through and sample each one. If you like the song, you can tap on the three-dot “more” menu next to the song to either listen to the full version in Apple Music or save the track to your Library. You can also tap the “Create Playlist” button, to give the AI-built playlist a name, then open it up in Apple Music’s app and begin listening.   "
116,Washington Uber and Lyft drivers win paid family and medical leave,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 13, 2023","Washington’s Senate unanimously passed a bill this week that would make the state the first in the nation to grant ride-hail drivers the right to paid family and medical leave. The bill, HB 1570, builds on driver rights won in 2022’s Expand Fairness Act, which set a high statewide wage floor for drivers and established a right to protections against unjustified deactivation, worker’s compensation insurance and paid sick time. The win in Washington comes a month after drivers in California were dealt a blow when the state upheld Proposition 22, the ballot measure passed in November 2020 that classified Uber and Lyft drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. A lower court had previously ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional. Washington’s ruling could have ripple effects in other states fighting to grant gig workers employment benefits. “Today is a landmark in the fight for worker rights nationwide” said Peter Kuel, president of Drivers Union, an association of ride-hail drivers, in a statement. Kuel started driving for Uber and Lyft in 2014. “In the State of Washington, drivers must no longer choose between caring for unwell loved ones and putting food on the table. This victory is a demonstration of what drivers can achieve when they organize together to fight for the rights that every worker deserves.” The bill will head to Governor Jay Inslee’s desk to be signed into law. Access to the program is expected to come online for drivers in July 2024. It’ll grant ride-hail drivers access to the same program as other workers in the state, which offers up to 12 weeks of paid leave if a serious health condition prevents them from working or if they need to take time off to care for a family member or a new child. The cost of a driver’s premiums for the program will be fully paid by the app-based companies, like Uber and Lyft, for which the driver works, according to the union. It’s not clear how the ride-hail companies intend to fund the program or whether they’ll increase rider fares in Washington to compensate. Washington has more than 30,000 Uber and Lyft drivers, most of whom are immigrants and people of color, according to a 2022 study. The report also found that about a third of drivers and their families rely on food stamps in King County, with a quarter living in federal poverty. “This is another historic win for drivers in Washington state and is a continuation of the progress made last year with the passage of HB 2076, first-in-the-nation legislation to provide drivers in Washington with numerous benefits,” said Lyft in a statement. “HB 1570 would add paid family medical leave and unemployment insurance benefits to that list. These new benefits and protections are the result of legislators, app-based companies, and labor organizations listening to drivers and working together.” Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
117,UK’s greenworkx takes aim at the domestic retrofit skills challenge,['@riptari'],"April 3, 2023","Steering humanity out of the climate crisis demands action in a very literal way. Boots on the ground, people rolling up sleeves and getting hands dirty retrofitting existing infrastructure, such as poorly insulated houses, type stuff. The goal is to re-make our built environment to be energy efficient and drive down carbon emissions ASAP. So we really need lots and lots more skilled tradespeople — fast. Aka, the kind of multifaceted, hands-on skills that technologists haven’t figured out how to automate yet. Fixing this problem absolutely, therefore, demands human beings. Lots and lots of people to come in, eager and willing to learn new stuff, and take up green retrofitting jobs. So it’s a job discovery problem. And a training/upskilling/reskilling problem. Which means digital technology can of course help. And this is where a U.K. edtech startup founded last year, called greenworkx, is angling to step in — with a new spot of supportive construction: A digital pathway designed to boost the flow of skilled workers into green jobs. The London-based team, which has just closed a £600k pre-seed funding round, describes what’s it’s building as “the go-to talent portal for green jobs”. The app soft launched towards the start of the year, after the co-founders formally incorporated the startup in mid June last year. The early stage funding round was led by Mangrove Capital Partners, with participation from Ada Ventures, and a number of angel investors in the climate and edtech sectors, including the CEOs of Multiverse (Euan Blair), MyTutor (Bertie Hubbard) and Octopus Electric Vehicles (Fiona Howarth). Commenting in a statement, Nikolas Krawinkel, partner at Mangrove, heralded the opportunity of the looming “green industrial revolution”, writing: “We’re on the cusp of a green industrial revolution, which will require a huge rethink of our education and training systems. The greenworkx team have a deep understanding of digital-first learning methodologies and we’re excited to work with them to take on this profoundly important challenge.” “The urgent ramp-up needed in the green workforce is a unique opportunity to build a fairer, more equitable future by bringing millions into a rapidly-growing sector of huge social and environmental importance,” added Matt Penneycard, founding partner at Ada Ventures, in another supporting statement. “We’re incredibly excited about the double impact that greenworkx can have in empowering people to access well-paid, future-ready jobs, whilst simultaneously directly driving the net-zero revolution to address the climate crisis.” The startup’s vision is to build a platform and digital tools to drive awareness and accelerate the uptake of green jobs, using techniques like bite-sized learning and algorithmic matching of jobseekers to connect them with relevant opportunities to help build and power up the green economy. Co-founders Mat Ilic and Richard Ng bring backgrounds in public policy work and education and edtech to bear on this skills funnel challenge. Ilic, the policy guy, says he was inspired to tackle the people side and the green jobs challenge as he was reading John Doerr’s book, Speed and Scale — which is literally subtitled an “action plan for solving our climate crisis now”. “It was the first time that net zero felt like a manageable problem,” he tells TechCrunch, saying the book helped him realize “how significant people are” — especially “the people we need to bring about the transition, not just people to make lifestyle changes” — and so the “loose idea was was born then and there”. Ng, who started his career as a maths teacher before moving into edtech and, latterly, training software engineers at U.K. tech apprenticeship startup Multiverse, says he’d felt pretty settled in that career — until he got speaking to Ilic and also got the green jobs itch. “He was explaining to me this problem that in order to reach Net Zero we need to deploy all this green infrastructure… and I remember being really shocked by this because I thought wow, this is obviously a huge problem, which is really high stakes, really time urgent, and yet when I think about skills and future work so often it’s purely about ‘oh we need to code’,” he says in a video call with TechCrunch, offering a tacit critique of the full-throttle focus on ‘learn to code’ of the past (many) years. (Code, after all, may well end up being automated by powerful technologies like generative AI — even as we’re still in desperate need of double glazers, plumbers, electricians etc etc.) There are also of course plenty of people for whom learning to code is never going to be the right fit. And Ng says he realized there’s an unfolding opportunity for all sorts of workers to thrive in green jobs as demand for these more hands-on, people-facing skills keeps growing — as well as being excited by the chance to build out the kind of support for vocational training and learning that the U.K.’s traditional educational system has not been geared toward. “We need people to work with data, that’s very necessary, and there’s a bunch of people working on that now. But I was like this is also super, super important and really, really underserved,” he says. “Coding, unfortunately, is phenomenally inaccessible for a bunch of people… [Whereas] these jobs… are really, really meaningful, they’re pretty well paid and they’re actually very accessible as well. And so, for me, it was also about making sure that as we think about this really important challenge Net Zero we’re also using that as an opportunity to make sure we have this bright future of work which is hopefully much more inclusive and accessible to the communities which I care a lot about.” The scale of the retrofit challenge means the skills supply problem is vast indeed. Ilic cites a statistic suggesting at least 30 million roles will be needed globally by the end of the decade — and half a million in the U.K. alone, just for domestic energy retrofitting. (And the startup’s stated mission is to get 10 million people into green jobs over 10 years.) While the challenge is global the U.K. certainly has some of the worst insulated homes in Europe, making that element a particularly acute local problem. Solutions can also be interdependent, too — since, for example, poorly insulated homes aren’t a good fit for low carbon heat pumps — which means tackling drafty buildings is really a prerequisite for speeding up the decarbonization of U.K. housing stock. “We’re talking about half a million different professions and trades needed in already an existing skills shortage in construction — and that’s before we start talking about the other aspect of this, which is the existing workers who need to be reskilled in what’s basically the biggest reallocation of capital and the means of production since the Industrial Revolution,” says Ilic, adding: “And no one seems to be talking about it with the level of urgency and emergency and scale that is needed — and more fundamentally, we’re here because we believe it’s eminently solvable. And that’s what’s so practical about the way that we’re looking at this challenge.” Some other startups are talking about it, of course. Denmark-based Lun, for example, recently bagged seed funding to build software tools to encourage more tradespeople to focus on installing heat pumps, instead of taking on less climate friendly jobs. While US-based BlocPower has already been beavering away for almost a decade with a residential retrofit-as-service platform focused on low-income communities. But it’s fair to say the scale of the change needed across our societies is so absolute — so root and branch — that it’ll need a tsunami of startups tackling as many bits and pieces as possible if we’re to drive the necessary system flip at the blistering pace now required to avoid even worse heating and weather extremes (not to mention the risk of runaway climate change). Greenworkx’s app is soft launched at this stage — with a handful (around 40) of green skills seekers signed up to a (free) introductory retrofit course they’re offering. Early users are more of a mix than the team’s expected target youth demographic (i.e. 16-24-year-old school and college leavers who did not follow the academic higher education route to university) — with Ng noting other profiles of interest include immigrants in their mid thirties to forties seeking a career switch into more stable work. Another early user he mentions was a former nurse — a women in her late fifties who could no longer continue working in a patient-facing role (owing to developing allergies) but who was looking for another job that allows her to keep serving her community and retrofitting social housing fit the bill for her. (“It’s a way to basically continue serving her community.”) To locate their first users they’ve been partnering with organizations and charities that are focused on employability. But as they seek to scale up they plan to expand the pool of jobseekers via digital marketing on social media and tapping up the sorts of influencers who might resonant with key targets. They’re also planning a possible green jobs travelling roadshow to take their message of climate opportunity around the country in an electric bus. The early product is still quite a manual experience, per the co-founders, as the team has been focused on understanding learner profiles and needs so they can better tailor the platform experience. But the goal is, ultimately, to automate the process of matching jobseekers to green skills opportunities to be able to scale the platform and its outputs. “We’ve had our first proactive inbound from a small company this week looking for energy assessors and retrofit assessors,” notes Ilic. “So it’s been really interesting to see that. And in terms of where we focus attention on the job side, so really a lot of investment is going into decarbonizing social housing at the moment — housing associations, local authorities and smaller energy efficiency or construction companies are all looking for these sort of energy efficiency professionals or trades. So some of that is them reaching out to us some of it is us working with them. So we’re pretty confident that for this kind of batch of people that we’re taking through — both the understanding retrofit courses as well as some partnerships that are more focused on domestic energy assessment or retrofit advice — we should be able to get our first job outcomes and then explore how it goes from there.” For larger energy companies and construction firms the first focus is likely to be on upskilling an existing workforce, rather than trying to hire scores of new workers. So the startup is thinking how it might best support those goals. They’re also still figuring out how much training content they might offer themselves — vs working with partners and/or employers to provide it. But the overarching goal is to find ways to support as many people as possible to think about a career switch, skills upgrade or first leap into green jobs. “We’re a b2b proposition. And the ultimate goal is to create value by giving people the talent they couldn’t otherwise reach — so filling roles,” says Ilic. “But I think we’re exploring a range of different steps in between, including actually having that curriculum and training proposition to support reskilling existing workers, because if we’re building a high quality digital curriculum for connecting people to these jobs from a standing start, actually it’s also relevant for people that are learning about low carbon heating technologies in their current jobs. So both reskilling and recruitment are going to be part of our value proposition.” “We are starting supply side. We want to build a tool that will matter so much to learners that they will obsess about,” he adds. “They would be prepared to pay for it even though we’d never want to charge them for it because we want to create a frictionless route for them to be able to access these roles. Because that’s partly in our collective interest — as I said, we’re looking at servicing the labour demand — but, yeah, we feel that the business side will become kind of apparent as things unfold; as you see the kind of exponential growth, say the consumer demand for solar among other things, so that’s what we’re planning.” This report was updated to correct a citation by Ilic: The projection is for 30M retrofit jobs being needed globally before the end of the decade, not in the U.K. — there the projection is for half a million roles being required by 2030    "
118,Lordstown savior Foxconn is threatening to pull funding,['@kirstenkorosec'],"May 1, 2023","Lordstown Motors is at risk of failing — again. The EV startup that went public via a SPAC merger cautioned investors Monday that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy because Foxconn may pull out of a critical funding deal, according to a regulatory filing. Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn sent a letter April 21 to Lordstown stating the automaker was in breach of the investment agreement because its stock price fell below $1 for 30 days and was at risk of being delisted on the Nasdaq exchange. Foxconn warned it would terminate the investment agreement if the breach is not resolved within 30 days. While Lordstown disagreed with Foxconn’s assertion and said it intended to enforce its rights, the company also warned that withholding key funding would be detrimental to the company. If the investment doesn’t go through, Lordstown won’t have the funding it needs to continue operating, according to the SEC filing. Lordstown said it is evaluating legal and financial alternatives in the event a resolution is not reached. “As a result of these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern,” Lordstown wrote in the regulatory filing. “Our ability to obtain additional financing is extremely limited under current market conditions, in particular for our industry, and also influenced by other factors including the significant amount of capital required, the Foxconn dispute, the fact that the BOM [bill of materials cost] of the Endurance is currently, and expected to continue to be, substantially higher than our selling price, uncertainty surrounding the performance of any vehicle produced by us, meaningful exposure to material losses and costs related to ongoing litigation and the SEC investigation, the Nasdaq Notice, the market price of our stock and potential dilution from the issuance of the additional securities.” The company added it would file for bankruptcy if it’s unable to resolve the dispute with Foxconn or identify other sources of funding. Foxconn agreed last November to increase its investment in Lordstown Motors by buying $170 million in common stock and newly created preferred shares. The additional investment came a year after Lordstown sold its 6.2-million-square-foot factory to Foxconn. As part of that $230 million deal, which included a direct investment of $50 million, Foxconn agreed to help Lordstown Motors manufacture its Endurance pickup truck."
119,The week in AI: OpenAI attracts deep-pocketed rivals in Anthropic and Musk,"['Kyle Wiggers', 'Devin Coldewey']","April 15, 2023","Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of the last week’s stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own. The biggest news of the last week (we politely withdraw our Anthropic story from consideration) was the announcement of Bedrock, Amazon’s service that provides a way to build generative AI apps via pretrained models from startups including AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Stability AI. Currently available in “limited preview,” Bedrock also offers access to Titan FMs (foundation models), a family of AI models trained in-house by Amazon. It makes perfect sense that Amazon would want to have a horse in the generative AI race. After all, the market for AI systems that create text, audio, speech and more could be worth more than $100 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. But Amazon has a motive beyond nabbing a slice of a growing new market. In a recent Motley Fool piece, Timothy Green presented compelling evidence that Amazon’s cloud business could be slowing. The company reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth for its cloud services in Q3 2022, but the uptick slowed to a mid-20% rate by the tail-end of the quarter. Meanwhile, operating margin for Amazon’s cloud division was down 4 percentage points year over year in the same quarter, suggesting that Amazon expanded too quickly. Amazon clearly has high hopes for Bedrock, going so far as to train the aforementioned in-house models ahead of the launch — which was likely not an insignificant investment. And lest anyone cast doubt on the company’s seriousness about generative AI, Amazon hasn’t put all of its eggs in one basket. It this week made CodeWhisperer, its system that generates code from text prompts, free for individual developers. So, will Amazon capture a meaningful piece of the generative AI space and, in the process, reinvigorate its cloud business? It’s a lot to hope for — especially considering the tech’s inherent risks. Time will tell, ultimately, as the dust settles in generative AI and competitors large and small emerge. Here are the other AI headlines of note from the past few days: Image Credits: Google / Stanford University Image Credits: Google / Stanford University https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=WPunit Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta Meta open-sourced a popular experiment that let people animate drawings of people, however crude they were. It’s one of those unexpected applications of the tech that is both delightful yet totally trivial. Still, people liked it so much that Meta is letting the code run free so anyone can build it into something. Another Meta experiment, called Segment Anything, made a surprisingly large splash. LLMs are so hot right now that it’s easy to forget about computer vision — and even then, it’s a specific part of the system that most people don’t think about. But segmentation (identifying and outlining objects) is an incredibly important piece of any robot application, and as AI continues to infiltrate “the real world” it’s more important than ever that it can… well, segment anything. Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta Professor Stuart Russell has graced the TechCrunch stage before, but our half-hour conversations only scratch the surface of the field. Fortunately the man routinely gives lectures and talks and classes on the topic, which due to his long familiarity with it are very grounded and interesting, even if they have provocative names like “How not to let AI destroy the world.” You should check out this recent presentation, introduced by another TC friend, Ken Goldberg:"
120,"Twitter exposes secrets, FTC clamps down on review hijackers and Android 14 arrives",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 15, 2023","Hello, friends. Looking for a recap of this week’s news? You’re in the right place. It’s Week in Review (WiR), the (more or less) regular newsletter that recaps the top stories from the past few days written by the talented TC team. (Woot, alliteration.) There’s no quicker way to catch up on the stuff that matters. Of course, we’re a little biased. Before we get on with the good stuff, a reminder that TechCrunch Early Stage 2023 is nearly upon us — taking place April 20 in Boston. I’ll refrain from rehashing my pitch in past columns too much, but trust me when I say you’ll want to be there. Not only will you be treated to a healthy chunk of the TC editorial crew out and about — a rarity! — but you’ll also have access to expert panels covering the many aspects of startup building. Elsewhere in events land, don’t forget that Disrupt, TechCrunch’s annual flagship conference, kicks off September 19. We’re particularly excited about the AI Stage, which is new this year. Tickets are available here. With that out of the way, on to the news: Private no more: This week, numerous Twitter users reported a bug in which Circle tweets — which are supposed to reach a select group, like an Instagram Close Friends story — were surfacing on the algorithmically generated For You timeline. That meant that some people’s supposedly private posts were breaching containment to reach an unintended audience, which quickly sparked some uncomfortable situations, Amanda reports. They made me do it: In a recent interview with BBC reporter James Clayton on Twitter Spaces, Twitter CEO Elon Musk admitted what many had suspected: He bought Twitter because he thought he’d be forced to. To recap, Twitter took Musk to trial last year to force him to honor his signed obligation to acquire the company for the agreed-upon price of $44 billion, or $54.20 per share. After some legal back-and-forth, Musk — staring down the barrel of a lengthy court battle — agreed to buy the company at the price he originally set. Twitter become X: In even more Twitter news (it’s a lot, I know), Twitter, Inc., is now called X Corp., according to a court filing in California. Amanda writes that Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $44 billion last year, has aspired to build what he calls “X, the everything app.” This proposed app might look like China’s WeChat, which supports messaging, payments, ride-sharing, food delivery and other services all in one place. Hijacked reviews: The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved a final consent order in its first-ever enforcement action over a case involving “review hijacking,” or when a marketer steals consumer reviews of another product to boost the sales of its own. Sarah writes that, in this case, the FTC ordered supplements retailer The Bountiful Company, the maker of Nature’s Bounty vitamins and other brands, to pay $600,000 for deceiving and misleading customers on Amazon. If it’s free, it’s for me: Google TV, Google’s smart TV operating system that powers Chromecast devices and various TVs, this week got a significant update aimed at expanding access to free, streaming content. Google TV now integrates access to free streaming channels like Tubi, Plex and Haystack News directly in its redesigned Live tab, alongside the existing lineup of channels from free streamer Pluto TV. New phone, who dis?: In an effort to expand its reach, Stockholm-based Truecaller is introducing an update that’ll provide live caller ID support on iOS, available to people using its paid tiers. Jagmeet writes that the new feature comes as Truecaller continues to see a lot of growth, but also some knocks in its strongest markets, such as India. Clay is the new plastic: Disposable plastic and paper cups are an environmental mess. GaeaStar, a startup based in Berlin and San Francisco, thinks it can do better with just clay, water, salt and sand, Harri reports. To make the disposable containers, the startup says that it developed a special 3D-printer that churns them out in “30 seconds or less” — quite the claim. New Android on the block: Google’s Android development cycle runs on a rather predictable cadence these days. To wit, this week, after two developer previews, the company launched the first of four planned public beta releases of Android 14, Frederic reports. As with previous versions, the first beta is also the first release that anyone can install over the air, assuming they have a supported Pixel device, going back to the Pixel 4a 5G (but not the Pixel 4). TechCrunch’s roster of podcasts hasn’t gotten any less impressive, in case you haven’t given any of it a listen. Over on Equity, the crew dove into deals of the week, regulation and on-the-ground dynamics at play in the AI space and the opportunity that funds may afford venture firms. And on this week’s Found, Lauren Markler came talked about how her company, Cofertility, aims to rebrand egg donation by making the process less transactional — and much more affordable. TC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys — which you know if you’re already a subscriber. If you’re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week: SaaS metrics that attract investors: Oleksandr Yaroshenko, the head of strategy and investments at Headway, writes about what engagement metrics gain the most significant interest from investors, including engagement over long periods at the end of a subscription and the frequency of interactions with core app features. What tailpipe regs mean for investors: The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing new rules that would take effect in 2027 and pave the way for a new vehicle market dominated by EVs. Tim writes about how investment opportunities abound as the rules push EVs to the forefront. Robot revolution: Brian spoke with over a dozen VCs about the state of robotics investing in 2023. As he notes, despite the recent downtrend, robotics remains vibrant and exciting, and it unquestionably has a bright future of exponential growth ahead."
121,Amazon’s $1.7B iRobot acquisition scrutinized by UK on competition grounds,['@psawers'],"April 6, 2023","The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has confirmed that it’s assessing Amazon’s billion-dollar bid for robot vacuum maker iRobot. The case is still at its earliest possible stage, where the CMA is essentially soliciting comments from relevant stakeholders to establish whether there may be a “substantial lessening of competition” in the U.K. as a result of Amazon buying iRobot. The CMA hasn’t provided any specific timescales or deadlines for when it will announce whether to proceed with an official investigation. Founded some 30 years ago out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), iRobot is probably best known for its Roomba-branded autonomous vacuum cleaners, though it also offers tangential products capable of mopping floors. With Amazon’s gradual foray into the smart home, as well as its own dabblings in home robotics, including integrations with Roombas, it wasn’t necessarily a huge surprise that iRobot would be a tempting proposition for Amazon, which tabled $1.7 billion to buy the publicly traded company in August. But against a backdrop of growing regulatory scrutiny in Big Tech, it was perhaps inevitable that the megabucks deal would draw the attention of authorities around the globe. Across the water in mainland Europe, EU regulators are reportedly preparing to investigate Amazon’s iRobot acquisition on privacy grounds, due to concerns over how Amazon might combine data from the two companies to gain a competitive advantage. In its domestic market, meanwhile, Amazon is already in the regulators’ crosshairs as part of a multifaceted investigation covering acquisitions, competition, privacy and more. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is currently mulling over an official investigation into its iRobot deal, though notably the FTC did greenlight Amazon’s $3.9 billion One Medical acquisition. As for the U.K., it currently has a bunch of antitrust deals to contend with. Just yesterday, regulator Ofcom revealed that it was preparing to refer the U.K. cloud infrastructure market for an in-depth investigation, with Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft specifically in focus. Microsoft’s bumper $68.7 billion bid for Activision is also in the CMA’s line of sight, as is Broadcom’s planned $61 billion VMware acquisition. And some 18 months ago, the CMA ordered Facebook parent Meta to sell off Giphy, which it had bought the previous year for $400 million. So while today’s news doesn’t necessarily mean that Amazon’s iRobot deal is in peril, it’s clear that the U.K. has an appetite for interrogating Big Tech’s M&A endeavors. And with EU and U.S. regulators also eyeing up a potential in-depth investigation, it would not be overly surprising if the U.K. did decide to launch an official inquiry. An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company is “working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger,” adding that consumers “have many options to choose from when they buy a vacuum.”"
122,Device42 tunes IT infrastructure tooling to measure carbon emissions,['@ron_miller'],"April 12, 2023","Device42, a startup that helps companies understand and manage their hybrid infrastructure, can see a lot of information about each customer’s hardware and software usage. The company decided to use that ability to look at how each part of the system was contributing to carbon emissions. “Our focus as a platform is to discover IT infrastructure, the breadth and depth of discovery going from mainframe to cloud and everything in between. [That includes] the physical layer all the way to the application and everything in between, including operating systems, software services, even the resource utilization data to help companies with right sizing,” company co-founder and CEO Raj Jalan told TechCrunch. The company decided to use that in-depth knowledge to give customers insight into the sustainability of the tooling they are using, and he says what makes his company’s approach different from the competition is that they tend to look at data center power consumption, power, utilization and power efficiency, and then generate a carbon emissions or sustainability dashboard that’s focused on data center power consumption. “What we have done differently is, since our focus has been marrying application data down to infrastructure, now we can tie your application to sustainability and your carbon footprint, and that’s kind of unique about what we are releasing,” Jalan said. He said this difference can have an impact on board level conversations about sustainability. “Instead of talking about how much your data center is costing you, how much energy is costing you, you can now start to think about what your carbon footprint looks like on an application level,” he explained. While this is a logical extension of what Device42 has been doing up until now, the company still had to build the capability to understand this type of information at this level. It builds on earlier work to add AI-enhanced data to the platform. “And this was taking all of the data we have in this discovered data, the enriched data, and now transforming that into a calculation around your sustainability, your carbon footprint, and then tying it back to your application,” he said. The new tool is available for customers at no additional cost, says Jalan. The company launched in 2010 and has raised more than $38 million, per Crunchbase. Its most recent raise was a $34 million Series A in 2019."
123,Nuview emerges from stealth with plans to map the Earth using lidar,['@breadfrom'],"May 4, 2023","Dozens of established players and newer entrants are competing to bring the most cutting-edge remote sensing data to customers. These companies may use hyperspectral, thermal, radar or optical instruments — but none, as of yet, use light detection and ranging (lidar), a technology that’s best-known for its use in self-driving cars. Nuview, a geospatial technology company that emerged from stealth today, wants to change that. The company aims to build out a constellation of 20 commercial satellites outfitted with its proprietary lidar system. The “endgame,” as Nuview founder and CEO Clint Graumann put it, is to map the entire land surface of the Earth with lidar — on an annual basis. It’s an ambitious plan, but one that could potentially generate huge revenues if the company manages to pull it off. There are many good reasons why no commercial company has managed to deploy space-based lidar at scale. NASA has sent up a handful of scientific payloads that use lidar, but they’re very large systems that require a lot of power. When lidar is used for mapping here on Earth, it’s done with unscalable and expensive platforms like aircraft and drones. Nor is it as simple as transferring lidar systems from self-driving cars to satellites; the former systems are usually short-range, with very low power requirements. Compared to what Nuview is building, it’s “apples and oranges,” Graumann said. But there have been a number of changes over the past five years that make Nuview’s ambitious plan technically feasible. Some parts of the lidar system have finally become commercially available after being the exclusive purview of the U.S. Department of Defense, for example. Nuview has also been able to bring down the size and weight of its system compared to others that have gone to space, he said. But in arguably the most significant breakthrough, Graumann said the company’s system will be able to scan large areas at once. “That’s what really unlocks the large revenue potential and the potential to do large projects at national-mapping scale,” he said. The space industry has changed as well: The cost of launch has dropped, thanks to innovations from SpaceX and other launch providers. Commercial small satellites are also now capable of generating enough power to run a lidar system, Graumann said, adding that all the satellite bus manufacturers Nuview is currently in talks with can all produce platforms powerful enough for the lidar payload. “That just wasn’t commercially feasible or even really doable four or five years ago, unless you had a massive system,” he said. Graumann said the idea for the company “struck [him] like a thunderbolt.” Graumann, an Earth observation (EO) industry veteran who was most recently consulting for EO companies and startups with his company TerraMetric, said he repeatedly heard from customers who wanted to fuse their dataset with lidar data. The company has kept a low profile since then. The Orlando, Florida-based startup closed its first round of funding last year and is in the middle of closing a second round. Nuview is not going public with how much capital the company has raised so far, nor its investors, but Florida Funders, MaC Venture Capital, Broom Ventures, Cortado Ventures and Industrious Ventures all list Nuview among their investments on their respective websites. The company also scored a government contract for an undisclosed amount. The company will start by launching a “proof of concept” satellite called “Mr. Spoc,” though they have no firm launch spot reserved yet. Once they’ve demonstrated their tech, they’ll attempt to launch the commercial constellation in tranches of five, spacing out each launch by 18 months until the company hits a constellation of 20. Nuview has landed over a billion dollars’ worth of “early adopter agreements” — revenues that hinge on the company delivering on spec. These early adopters will have access to the data that the Mr. Spoc spacecraft collects, and will be able to provide feedback on future satellites. Thus far, the company has a team of 21 full-time and contracted employees and is working on building out a new facility with optics, integration and laser labs in Orlando. So far, Graumann expects the company’s biggest market will be in national mapping for civil agencies around the world. Nuview has also seen interest from existing space-based sensing customers looking to fuse their data with lidar — to essentially make their product even more robust by combining it with lidar data. “When you’re looking at optical data, like you see on Google Earth, it’s pretty and it’s meant to see things visually. Lidar data are billions of discrete data points,” Graumann said. “When you’re thinking about the world of AI and machine learning, there’s nothing more valuable than more data points to train and work with. […] The satellite data that’s up there today was made for people. Lidar data is made for machines.” The story has been updated to include Cortado Ventures in the list of Nuview investors. "
124,IntegrityNext raises $109M for a platform to audit supply chains for ESG compliance,['@ingridlunden'],"March 23, 2023","The funding landscape remains very tough for technology startups, but there are still some pockets, and specific companies, driving a lot of interest among investors because they look like they’ll break through whatever current macroeconomic trends that are gripping the world. Today, a startup out of Munich called IntegrityNext announced that it has raised its first-ever funding, an equity round of €100 million ($109 million), for a new twist on supply chain software: a platform that helps organizations with lots of suppliers automatically audit and monitor those companies for compliance with environmental and sustainability governance (ESG) rules, both those that companies set for themselves, as well as those coming from a growing body of regulation. The funding is coming from a single investor, EQT Growth, and it will be used to continue building the breadth of the platform as well as the company’s go-to-market position. IntegrityNext has a growing number of customers — there are even a few would-be suppliers — across the U.S. and Europe, so the plan is to build more capabilities to meet that opportunity. Those capabilities will stay in the area’s environmental and ethical labor commitments, and for now, there are no plans to loop in audits around, say, whether a supply chain implicates a company in the act of breaking embargoes on countries over political disputes or issues of national security. The crux of the product is a platform that acts like a big data ingestion engine, sourcing information that is publicly available to help develop risk profiles for different markets and different companies, complemented by regular contact with businesses in the supply chain to supply details. All this is compiled into a database that then provides a warning system and audits for IntegrityNext’s customers to better understand what is going on in their supply chains. What they do next is up to those customers, though: they can then use this to help either require their partners to change things, change the partners themselves, send in human auditors for deeper investigations, or I guess nothing at all. But ultimately, this is about building a way to manage what might be thousands of suppliers for some companies. “You have to find an efficient way to manage that,” said Dominik Stein, a partner at EQT Growth. “You can’t go to every company and do every check yourself; it just doesn’t work.” (Stein’s joining an advisory board with this round.) From what I understand, a typical customer might pay $60,000/year for the service, but the figure could be significantly higher or lower depending on the size of the supply chain. IntegrityNext, and this round, are part of a group of startups that have grown impressively over several years but flown under the radar. The startup has been profitable since 2004, and has been completely bootstrapped until now. On its own steam, it’s picked up a 200-strong list of enterprise customers, including Siemens Gamesa, Infineon and SwissRe, with a supply chain database that monitors close to 1 million suppliers across 190 countries. According to CEO Martin Berr-Sorokin, who co-founded the company with Simon Jaehnig (CRO) and Nick Heine (COO), they decided to raise capital now to essentially strike while the iron is hot. The company had never taken outside funding, but it had no shortage of inbound interest, he said, and the state of the market and the fact that raising might not be as easy later swayed things. “We wanted to have a strong partner for our next growth phase,” Berr-Sorokin said in an interview. “We were getting to the next phase, and we need support for hiring, extending our network, sales and marketing, and going into new markets in Europe and the U.S. We didn’t have to do it. It was an option, and we feel lucky to have done it.” ESG is evolving rapidly as a market opportunity. On one hand, consumers, thanks in part to social media, have become significantly more aware of how a business’ supply chain might effectively paint that business with the tar of labor exploitation and poor environmental practices, and that is putting a lot of pressure on those businesses to do better. The businesses themselves, meanwhile, are at the end of the day run by humans. Some may be hard-nosed when it comes to getting business done at any cost, but a good number have a conscience and want to do right by that, not just for the sake of appearances. On the other hand, there have been notable developments playing out in the regulatory realm that might make whatever “nice to have” that has swirled around ESG into more of a “must do.” In Germany, companies with more than 3,000 employees are required to provide audits and reporting to demonstrate their own ESG compliance — compliance set by regulators — lest they face fines and other penalties. That number is coming down in 2024 to 1,000 employees. In Europe, there is regulation in progress that will place similar requirements on EU companies, bringing down the number of employees even more, to 250. And that opportunity is definitely one being spotted by others: Worldfavor and Prewave are also building platforms that automate the process of businesses auditing and monitoring suppliers. Others like Salesforce have started to put ESG supplier monitoring into their sustainability product sets, and a startup in France, Sesamm, is building AI tech to help companies with their sustainability commitments. That’s not the whole story, though: there will be inevitable pushback on these regulations, and there is a big question mark over how all of this will play out in one of the biggest and most industrialized nations in the world, the U.S., where some legislators have floated the idea of not only staying away from any regulation of this kind, but even proactively discouraging developments on this front as counter to economic progress. Businesses are also not all on board. “Yes, some companies complain, but others see it as a competitive advantage to be good in ESG,” said Berr-Sorokin. “Of course the regulatory regime helps us, but if it gets pushed back, we still have trends in our society and good corporate practices.”"
125,Google I/O 2023 is next week; here’s what we’re expecting,['@bheater'],"May 5, 2023","Google’s annual developer conference, Google I/O, returns to Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheater next week, and for the first time in four years, we’ll be returning along with it. The kickoff keynote is always jammed-packed full of information, debuting all of the different software projects the company has been working on for the past year. Update: Google just went ahead and announced the Pixel Fold over on Twitter. The company gave a good look at the upcoming foldable smartphone from just about every angle. That means all three of the expected pieces of hardware – including the Pixel 7a and Pixel Tablet – have officially been announced. The event, which kicks off May 10 at 10 AM PT will be a big showcase for everything that’s on the way for Android 14. The company has, arguably, missed a step when it comes to the current generative AI land rush — hell, who could have predicted after all of these years that Bing would finally have a moment? CEO Sundar Pichai will no doubt be making the case that the company continues to lead the way in the world of artificial intelligence. There’s always been a fair bit of the stuff at the event largely focused on practical real-world applications like mobile imaging and dealing with customer service. This year, however, I’d say it’s safe to say the company is going to go bonkers with the stuff. Hardware, meanwhile, is always a bit of a crapshoot at developer conferences. But after an off-year for the industry at large, a deluge of rumors are aligning, pointing to what’s likely to be an unusually consumer electronics-focused keynote. Given the fact that the last bit is my focus at TechCrunch, I’m going to start the list there. The Pixel 7a is about as sure as bets get. Google has settled into a comfortable release cadence: releasing a flagship in the fall, followed by a budget device in the spring. The former is designed to be an ideal showcase for its latest mobile operating system and first-party silicon, while the latter makes some compromises for price, while maintaining as many of its predecessors as possible.  It’s a good system that works, and Google’s newly focused mobile hardware team has created some surprisingly good devices at extremely reasonable prices. Never one to be outdone by the deluge of rumors, the company went ahead and announced via Twitter its next device is due out on May 11 — the day after Google I/O and, perhaps not coincidentally, my birthday. It was Google India that specifically made the announcement — perhaps not surprising, as the company is likely to aggressively target the world’s number one smartphone market with the product. The image points to a very similar design as the 7 — not really a surprise as these things go. Though it does stop short of actually mentioning the name, as it’s done in the past. Basically expect the 7 with cheaper materials. Rumors point to a 6.1-inch device featuring a 90Hz refresh rate, coupled with a 64-megapixel rear camera. The 7’s Tensor G2 returns for a command performance, likely bringing with it many of the software features it enabled the first time around. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google We know for sure that a Pixel Tablet is coming…at some point. Google confirmed the device’s existence at last year’s event, providing a broad 2023 release date, along with a render alongside the rest of the current Pixel lineup. Effectively there are two points this year Google is likely to officially announce the thing: next week or September/October. I would be shocked if the company’s long-awaited (?) reentry into the category doesn’t, at the very least, get a bit of stage time. As a category, the Android tablet has been very hit or miss over the years — presumably/hopefully the company’s got a unique spin here. I would be surprised if Google jumped back into the space without some sort of novel angle. The leaks point to a design that would effectively turn the system into one giant Nest dock. It’s not entirely original, as Amazon tried something similar with its Fire tablets, but it would certainly buck the iPad model, which is so pervasive in the industry. Other rumors include the aforementioned Tensor G2, coupled with 8GB of RAM. Here’s your wildcard, folks: the Pixel Fold. Google has seemingly been laying the groundwork for its own foldable for years. Here’s what I wrote a couple of weeks ago: Some important background here. First, Google announced foldable screen support for Android back in 2018. Obviously, Samsung was both the big partner and recipient in those days, and Google wanted to make Android development as frictionless as possible for other OEMs in exploring the form factor. The following year, Google foldable patents surfaced. Now, we’re all adults here, who implicitly understand that patents don’t mean a company is working on a product. That said, it’s another key data point in this story. In the intervening years, foldables have begun gathering steam, even outside of the Samsung orbit. I was genuinely amazed by how many different models there were populating the halls of MWC back in March. The leaked renders point to a form factor that is more Samsung Galaxy Z Fold than Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. It also looks like it shares some common design DNA with Oppo’s recently foldable, which is frankly the right direction. EV Leaks says the foldable is half an inch thick when folded and 0.2 inches unfolded, weight in at 283 grams. As evidenced by our trip to MWC back in February, foldables are no longer fringe devices. It’s true that they’re still cost-prohibitive for most, but it’s getting to the point soon where nearly ever Android manufacturer will have their take on the category. So why shouldn’t Google? Other less likely hardware rumors include a Google/Nest AirTag competitor (the company announced yesterday that it’s working with Apple to create a standard for the category), new Pixel Buds and a Pixel Watch 2. I’d say all are unlikely — that last one in particular. We didn’t get much in terms of Nest products last year, but so far not much is forthcoming in terms of rumors for home products. Image Credits: Brian Heater Image Credits: Brian Heater Android is always a tentpole of Google I/O for obvious reasons. We’ve already caught some major glimpses of the mobile operating system, by way of beta releases. As Frederic noted in March, “So far, most of the features Google has talked about have also been developer-centric, with only a few user-facing features exposed to far. That also holds true for this second preview, which mostly focuses on added new security and privacy features.” The operating system, which is apparently named Upside Down Cake internally, is likely set for a summer release in late-July or August. At the top of the list of potential features are a boost to battery life (can always use one of those), additional accessibility features and privacy/security features, which include blocking users from installing ancient apps over malware concerns. AI is going to be everywhere. Expect generative AI (Bard) in particular to make appearances in virtually every existing piece of Google consumer software, following the lead of Gmail and Docs. Search and the Chrome browser are prime targets here. A preview of a new Wear OS seems likely. I don’t anticipate a ton of news on the AR/VR side of things, but I would also be surprised if it doesn’t at least get a nod, given what Apple reportedly has in the works for June. The keynote kicks off at 10 AM PT on May 10. As ever, TechCrunch will be bringing you the news as it breaks. "
126,Google’s new ad transparency center will keep track of a brand’s previous ads,['@indianidle'],"March 29, 2023","Google is launching a new ad transparency center that will let users search for verified advertisers and their campaigns across all of the company’s platforms, including Search, Display and YouTube. This new transparency center — which is accessible directly via this link and through the My Ad Center page — will let you search for ads from a brand, in what region those ads were shown and the time they last ran a campaign, along with the format. Users can like or block the ad or even report it for violation of Google ad policies if those ads show dangerous products or inappropriate content, for instance. The Center is starting to roll out today and will be available to all users over the coming weeks. Notably, Google launched the My Ad Center hub last year, which lets users see information about ad topics, brands and the recent ads they saw across Search, YouTube and Discover. Users can tweak these settings by removing topics or brands or turning off personalized ads entirely. It’s important to remember that this doesn’t mean you won’t see any ads. It just won’t be based on your preferences and search data. Google said that, after the launch, 20% of the 70 million visits to the My Ad Center page were to adjust ad preferences. Given that billions of people use Google’s platforms, this number doesn’t seem that impressive. The Mountain View-based company said it is introducing this new transparency center so customers can know more about unknown brands and check if they have been verified by Google. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google “We’re committed to protecting our users by creating a safer, more trustworthy, and accountable ad experience. With the Ads Transparency Center, you’re never in the dark about the ads you see on Google,” Alejandro Borgia, director of product management for Ads Safety said in a statement. Google has been trying to provide more data on brand advertising through the company’s platform. Last September, Google started to give users access to an advertiser’s history. A month later, the tech giant updated its “Ad” tag to “Sponsored” on mobile search for better visibility. Plus, it moved the tag above the URL instead of showing it next to the link address. The search giant also launched an Ad Safety Report highlighting its effort toward thwarting malicious ads. The company said it blocked or removed 5.2 billion ads, restricted over 4.3 billion ads and suspended 6.7 million advertiser accounts. Google noted that last year it expanded its financial service certification program to 11 countries, including the U.K., Australia and Singapore. This project, aimed at stopping financial fraud, requires advertisers to show that they have permission from local authorities to promote their products and services. Google mentioned that in the last year it updated or introduced 29 ad-related policies to protect consumers. The company’s ad business, which is its biggest revenue driver, is facing scrutiny in the U.S. In January, the Department of Justice accused Google of abusing its monopolist position in the ad market.

127,Google to roll out new extreme heat alerts in Search soon,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 29, 2023","Google is introducing new extreme heat alerts in Search that are designed to surface information to help people stay safe during heat waves. The new heat alerts will roll out in the coming months. When people search for information on extreme heat, they will now see information about when a heat wave is expected to begin and end. The alert will also surface tips on staying cool and warn users about related health concerns they should be aware of. All of this information will be prominently displayed in Search results. The search giant said it has partnered with the Global Heat Health Information Network to ensure that the information it surfaces in the alerts is accurate. “We’ll be launching a new feature to raise awareness about extreme heat to keep people safe, cool and healthy,” said Hema Budaraju, Google’s senior director of product for health and search, during a briefing with reporters. “Soon, you will see dedicated features highlighting relevant news, recommended actions and local information during a severe heat wave. The new heat alert is one of the many ways we’re continuing to update search to help people find timely, authoritative and actionable information when they need it the most.” Google has been displaying alerts for things like wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes and more for several years. The company notes that the introduction of the heat alerts feature comes as search interest in heat waves reached a record high globally in June 2022. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google The company also said Tree Canopy, a tool that combines AI and aerial imagery so cities can understand their current tree coverage and better plan urban forestry initiatives, has expanded from 14 cities to nearly 350 cities globally — including Atlanta, Baltimore, Buenos Aires, Lisbon, Mexico City, Paris, Sydney and Toronto. Google plans to expand the tool to thousands of additional cities this year. Today’s announcement comes a day after Google said it was introducing new ways for users to verify information on Search. The search giant is launching new features called “Perspectives” and “About this author,” while also expanding some of its current tools, including “About this result.” Two weeks ago, Google said it was making it easier for people to find affordable healthcare centers near them in Search. If a medical clinic offers affordable care, you will soon see a label that reads “Free or low-cost care” under its name in search results.  "
128,Meta pitches augmented reality to advertisers with new AR Reels Ads and Facebook Stories,['@sarahintampa'],"May 4, 2023","Augmented reality is coming to Reels Ads and Facebook Stories, Meta announced this afternoon at the IAB’s NewFronts as part of its pitch to advertisers. The update allows brands like Sephora, Tiffany & Co. and others to offer more immersive experiences and AR filters when marketing to Meta’s audience, including its younger Gen Z users. The company said it’s also rolling out other enhancements and improvements to Reels ads and noted brands will now be able to work with third-party measurement partners for their Reels Ads campaigns. Meta’s investment in augmented reality (AR) advertising could better position the company to compete with Snap for marketers’ ad dollars, as they look for ways to reach the younger, Gen Z demographic. Earlier this week at NewFronts, Snap introduced its own set of new ad products, including those for Stories and its TikTik clone known as Spotlight. But its more eye-catching news was its test of sponsored links in its AI chatbot feature, My AI. In terms of AR, however, Snap has long offered ways for brands to reach its users through the format, including through a variety of AR commerce features and its popular Snapchat Lenses, for example. It also works with brands that want to leverage its AR technology on their own websites and apps through its AR Enterprise Services division. Before today’s announcement, Meta offered AR ads in the Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed and Instagram Stories. According to its data, these ads drove incremental ad recall with the 18- to 24-year-old demographic 87% of the time, outperforming non-AR-enabled ads. Now, those ads can run in other prominent places across Meta’s platform, including Facebook and Instagram Reels and Facebook Stories. Sephora was able to test AR Reels ads ahead of this launch, where it ran an ad that had users press their thumb to the screen to generate an “aura vibe” filter to help them pick the best-fitting fragrance and make a purchase. The company said over half of the ad’s audience was Gen Z users. Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta Tiffany & Co. also created an AR ad that let users immerse themselves in their 5th Avenue flagship store, “The Landmark,” and browse the jewelry. In addition to the expansion of AR advertising, Meta announced features to make Reels Ads more interactive, including a test of a larger “call to action” button with additional advertiser information on Facebook and Instagram Reels ads. The button includes an ad thumbnail, headline and additional business details, like the website URL, to help direct interested customers to click. Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta The company will also now allow Facebook users to pause a video ad and preview where the link would take them, potentially driving an increase in click-through rates for Reels Ads. For shopping ads, Reels will introduce new multi-destination product ads which means that instead of an ad only pointing to a retailer’s website or single product page, they can swipe through multiple product images in a carousel without leaving the Reel they’re watching. Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta Meta also said marketers can now work with select third-party measurement firms on Reels Ads campaigns, including Double Verify, IAS and MOAT. The company said these firms are helping it to test and launch a Reels Viewability reporting option that will later roll out to advertisers when testing is complete. The company also took a moment during its presentation to pitch its investments in AI, noting it’s using the technology is being used to improve ads ranking by learning which ads are working and which are not, and to better predict which ads are going to be most relevant. “It’s also driving efficiency for a suite of ad products, eliminating many of the manual and tedious steps of creating an ad,” said Nicola Mendelsohn, Meta’s head of Global Business Group. She added that Meta’s investments were “already paying off, especially with Meta Advantage, which is our brand name for our portfolio of AI products. Meta Advantage leverages machine learning and AI to help advertisers test and learn but to also realize their campaigns fast and help them acquire and grow their customer base.” Mendelsohn said the majority of Meta advertisers were already using an AI product, Advantage+ Shopping, launched only last August. Before, advertisers had to manually set up a campaign to text their mix of targeting, creative and placement, she explained, which was time-consuming. Now, advertisers can use Advantage+ Shopping campaigns to executive million of iterations of targeting performance scenarios within milliseconds, allowing them to pick the best combination, in order to send the best ad to the right person at the right time — all thanks to AI. “This is just the start of how AI can create better connections with people and drive more growth for your business. And we’re going to have more and more product updates and announcements around AI just in the coming few weeks,” she said. The company had also spoken about its AI agenda during its Q1 earnings, noting also how AI was improving its Reels monetization efficiency, which was up over 30% on Instagram and over 40% on Facebook on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Plus, CEO Mark Zuckerberg also shared that Meta’s future plans for AI included “chat experiences in WhatsApp and Messenger, visual creation tools for posts in Facebook and Instagram and ads, and over time video and multi-modal experiences.”"
129,Twitter to label tweets that get downranked for violating its hate speech policy,['@sarahintampa'],"April 17, 2023","Twitter announced today a new policy that it claims will offer more transparency around which hateful tweets on its platform have been subject to enforcement action. Typically, when tweets violate Twitter’s policies, one of the actions the company can take is to limit the reach of those tweets — or something it calls “visibility filtering.” In these scenarios, the tweets remain online but become less discoverable, as they’re excluded from areas like search results, trends, recommended notifications, For You and Following timelines, and more. Instead, if users want to see the tweet, they have to visit the author’s profile directly. The tweet may also be downranked in replies when such enforcement takes place and ads won’t run against the content, Twitter’s guidelines state. Historically, the wider public would not necessarily know if a tweet had been moderated in this way. Now Twitter says that will change. The company plans to “soon” begin adding visible labels on tweets that have been identified as potentially violating its policies, which has impacted their visibility. It did not say when exactly the system would be fully rolled out across its network. Image Credits: Twitter Image Credits: Twitter In addition, not all tweets that have had their visibility reduced will be labeled, the company noted. It’s starting only with tweets that violate its Hateful Conduct policy and says it will expand the feature to other policy areas in the “coming months.” “This change is designed to result in enforcement actions that are more proportional and transparent for everyone on our platform,” a blog post authored by “Twitter Safety” stated. The post additionally touted Twitter’s enforcement philosophy, calling it “Freedom of Speech, not Freedom of Reach.” If a tweet is labeled, the user themselves won’t be shadowbanned or removed from the network — the company notes the policy actions will occur at “a tweet level only and will not affect a user’s account.” Twitter also explains that users whose tweets were labeled will be able to submit feedback if they think their tweet was incorrectly flagged, but says they may not get a response to that feedback, nor will it guarantee the tweet’s reach will be restored. Likely, this has to do with the vast cuts Twitter made to its Trust & Safety teams and the company as a whole. And it may be relying heavily on automation to make its decisions over labeling, though it’s unclear to what extent this system will be automated. (Twitter no longer replies to press inquiries, so blog posts and tweets made by the company or its new owner, Elon Musk, are the only official word on things like this.) Automation, of course, could mean Twitter will get things wrong — something it admits in a Twitter thread about the changes. Here, the company also says it plans to allow authors to appeal its decision at some point “in the future.” Again, no hard deadline or a ballpark time frame was provided. We will continue to remove illegal content and suspend bad actors from our platform. We’re committed to increasing transparency around our moderation actions, and we’ll continue to share updates on our progress. You can learn more about our various enforcement actions here:… — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) April 17, 2023  The launch of the new policy follows Twitter’s earlier decisions under Musk to allow controversial figures, including Trump and neo-Nazis to rejoin the network. In one incident, Musk brought the artist formerly known as Kanye West back to Twitter, who then tweeted a swastika and was resuspended. The new policy announced today may be one that reflects Twitter’s attempt to balance two opposing forces. On the one hand, Musk is a free-speech proponent who railed against Twitter’s allegedly less-than-transparent moderation policies in the years before he took control of the company. He even went so far as to publicly share internal documents and communications, aka the Twitter Files, in an attempt to expose how Twitter’s moderation decisions had been made in the past. The results weren’t as astounding as he hoped. What was largely found was a company having to make complex and nuanced decisions, often in real time, around borderline content and high-profile figures. Visibility filtering was one of the topics the Twitter Files had covered, in fact. Musk aimed to show that Twitter had previously been politically biased in its past filtering of tweets, but the report didn’t include any information about how many accounts or tweets were de-amplified or the politics of those who were impacted, so no conclusions could be made. But Musk’s personal beliefs are bumping up against the need to maintain a functioning business. That’s why, on the other side of things, Twitter could be attempting to make things right with advertisers. Since Musk’s takeover, advertisers have been fleeing the network. Major brands, including Mars, AT&T, VW and Stellantis have all gone — and all the brand safety measures haven’t been able to restore their trust. The company may hope that labeling tweets that have been de-ranked will help marketers feel more comfortable that their ads aren’t running directly alongside hate speech. But advertisers have plenty of other reasons to be concerned over Twitter. Since Musk’s acquisition, the network has been chaotic, with constantly changing policies and features, including a now pay-for-reach version of Twitter Blue and, over the past few days, changes to how news outlets are labeled, leading to generally reliable newsrooms like PBS, NPR, CBC, and others to leave the platform entirely.

131,"Ex-Twitter CEO Agrawal, other execs sue firm over unpaid legal bills",['@indianidle'],"April 11, 2023","Former Twitter employees, including ex-CEO Parag Agrawal, ex-legal head Vijaya Gadde and ex-CFO Ned Segal, have sued the social network over alleged unpaid legal reimbursements. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleged that Twitter has to pay more than $1 million to the former executives for legal bills they incurred while at the company to respond to requests by the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission. “This action seeks an expedited ruling requiring Defendant to comply with its obligations to advance legal fees and expenses relating to ongoing litigation and investigations,” the lawsuit says. The document lists a number of legal battles and government probes these execs were involved in over the years as defendants. The plaintiffs wrote to Twitter multiple times demanding the reimbursement, but they just got acknowledgment receipts in response, the document added. The filing says that Twitter “breached the agreements [with employees] and contravened the bylaws” by not paying the former employees. After Elon Musk took over Twitter last October, he immediately fired Agrawal, Gadde and Segal. At that time Bloomberg reported that these execs had an exit package of more than $100 million. Twitter has become the subject of multiple lawsuits after Musk became its owner. These include cases by former employees and contractors alleging the company fired them without adequate notice and by several vendors who are accusing the company of not paying bills on time. The social media company is also involved in a legal battle in Germany, where authorities are seeking to fine Twitter over failing to remove hate speech. Under the country’s Network Enforcement Act (aka, NetzDG), companies could be fined up to €50 million for violation of the rules. Apart from Gadde, Twitter has lost a few legal heads in the past few months, including James Baker in December and Christian Dowell earlier this month."

133,Atlassian brings an AI assistant to Jira and Confluence,['@fredericl'],"April 19, 2023","Atlassian today announced the launch of Atlassian Intelligence, the company’s AI-driven “virtual teammate” that leverages the company’s own models in conjunction with OpenAI’s large language models to create custom teamwork graphs and enable features like AI-generated summaries in Confluence and test plans in Jira Software, or rewriting responses to customers in Jira Service Management. These new features will only come to Atlassian’s cloud-based offerings. The company doesn’t currently have plans to bring it to its data center editions. Image Credits: Atlassian Image Credits: Atlassian Every company, it seems, is trying to add ChatGPT-enabled features to its service these days, but few companies have the kind of reach and mindshare as Atlassian, especially with developers. Over the course of the last few years, the company also branched out well beyond its original focus on developers to include IT departments and other teams that interface with developers. This now gives it a rather unique view into how teams collaborate, something it is now also leveraging for this new product. Atlassian notes that the AI system also looks at how teams work together in order to create a “custom teamwork graph showing the types of work being done and the relationship between them.” This data can be enriched with additional content from third-party apps. For the most part, though, Atlassian Intelligence provides users with a Chat-GPT like chatbox that’s deeply integrated into the different products and that allows users to reference specific documents. For instance, if you want it to summarize the action items from a recent meeting, you only have to tell it to generate a summary and link the document with the transcript in order for it to generate a list of decisions and action items from this meeting — and you can do that right inside of Confluence, for example. It’ll also happily will draft social media posts about an upcoming product announcement based on the product specs in Confluence. Image Credits: Atlassian Image Credits: Atlassian Similarly, in Jira Software, developers can use the new AI features to quickly draft test plans based on what it knows about a given operating system or other information in a product’s specs. Users of Jira Service Management, though, may be the most likely to save time with Atlassian Intelligence. Here, users can now use a virtual agent to help automate support interactions right from inside Slack and Microsoft Teams. This new agent will be able to pull up answers from existing knowledge base articles for both agents and end users, for example, and it will also quickly summarize previous interactions for newly assigned agents to bring them up to date on a given issue. Image Credits: Atlassian Image Credits: Atlassian Another nifty feature here is that the new tool can translate natural language queries into the Atlassian’s SQL-like Jira Query Language, opening up this capability to many more users. All of these new capabilities are now available in early access. Organizations that want to try them can join a waitlist to get access to them here. Following the early access period, some of these features will become paid features over time, but Atlassian specifically notes that the virtual agent for Jira Service Management will be included at no extra cost in its Premium and Enterprise plans."
134,Mercu meets deskless workers where they are,['@catherineshu'],"May 4, 2023","Many employee engagement and retention tools were created with the assumption that workers spent most of their time at desks. But the majority of the global workforce is deskless, meaning that they are usually on the move and don’t have constant access to a laptop. A lot of them are also dissatisfied with their jobs, which means companies need to deal with high churn and low retention rates. Based in Singapore, Mercu wants to help with a platform designed specifically to reach deskless employees. Launched in November 2022, Mercu announced today it has raised $1.6 million in seed funding from 500 Global, TEN13, Flying Fox Ventures, Archangel Ventures, XA Network and returning investor Sequoia Capital India. Mercu is used by companies in retail, logistics, hospitality and manufacturing to onboard employees, communicate with them and help increase engagement. Its customers include Mexican fast food chain Guzman Y Gomez’s operations in Singapore and Sam Prince Hospitality Group in Australia. It also has customers in the United States, where the seed funding will be used to expand Mercu’s footprint and on hiring. Before launching Mercu, the startup’s two co-founders, Jascha Zittel and Elliott Gibb, both worked at Grab. Zittel, a product manager there, needed to communicate with millions of drivers in eight countries, and found that engagement for messages sent through WhatsApp and Facebook was much higher than in-app communications or email. The two told TechCrunch that COVID laid the groundwork for Mercu because it highlighted the importance of the deskless workforce, and also how little their needs were being met. Despite accounting for more than 70% of the global workforce, less than 1% of VC funding gets allocated to startups in the space, they said. Mercu founders Elliott Gibb and Jascha Zittel. Image Credits: Mercu Mercu founders Elliott Gibb and Jascha Zittel. Image Credits: Mercu While working at Grab, Zittel and Gibb, a former product designer on Grab’s passenger experience team, saw that many deskless workers feel disconnected from their companies, which negatively impacts retention rates. Keeping workers means staying in constant touch with them and that means meeting them where they are, which is why Mercu works with popular messaging apps instead of requiring workers to download yet another one. This is especially important in emerging markets where there are hardware and data bandwidth restrictions on smartphones. Mercu can be used to create custom content, or employers can pick from templates for campaigns like engagement surveys. The platform segments employees into groups based on their role, tenure and location, and gives content creators analytics about read and completion rates, industry benchmarks and recommendations. Some examples of what employers use Mercu for include team dinner invitations, recognition programs, shift swaps and training sign-offs. Guzman y Gomez automated their hiring and onboarding process by using Mercu to perform tasks like sending interview invites and offers through WhatsApp, which reduced the number of no-shows to interviews. The fast food chain also uses Mercu to gauge worker sentiment on a monthly basis to reduce turnover rates. Sam Prince Hospitality Group uses Mercu to send continuous training, including SOP updates, product information and sales training. Mercu’s product development team plans to focus on more tools for employees, including looking at how large language models, like ChatGPT, can be used to communicate with employees at scale."
135,"In Europe, Accel banks on a turnaround over the next 6 to 9 months",['@cookie'],"May 4, 2023","It’s been almost five years since this editor sat down with longtime VC Harry Nelis and three other investors from Accel’s London office to talk about the trends rippling through the venture industry. At the time, our talk largely centered on Brexit and SoftBank’s feverish pace of investment, which was beginning to drive other late-stage funds into earlier-stage companies. Of course, much has changed in the intervening years. Brexit came to pass in January 2020. COVID-19 took hold around the world soon after. A global downturn has also reshaped how investors and founders are thinking about their respective roles — and pushed SoftBank into the background. To learn how some of these shifts have impacted Accel (thanks to bets like Slack and UiPath, it raised some enormous funds just as things were cooling off), we chatted with Nelis again yesterday. Excerpts from that catch-up have been edited lightly below for length and clarity. TC: Your seventh fund closed almost exactly two years ago with $650 million as part of $3 billion in capital commitments that Accel announced in June 2021. This included funds in the U.S. and a global growth stage fund. How much of that fund have you committed?  HN: I think we’re roughly halfway through the fund. Subsequent to that whole fundraising, we raised another “Leaders Fund,” a pre-IPO fund, with $4 billion in commitments in June of ’22. But . . .we’re now in a period where things have slowed down quite dramatically. We have early-stage franchises in Palo Alto, London and Bangalore, India; we have two global funds — a global growth fund and a global pre-IPO fund. Especially the growth fund and pre-IPO fund, the business for them has been very slow because companies raised so much money over the last few years that they really don’t need any more. And they know that if they were to raise more money, it probably wouldn’t be at a higher valuation. So a lot of them are kind of trying to get as far as they can on the money that they’ve raised. Even the early-stage market was slow for a moment . . . but that has readjusted itself now, and the early-stage market is really back again. Accel downsized one of its funds back in 2001 after the big dot-com bust. The firm couldn’t put the money to work that it had raised, and LPs were meanwhile in a bind because of the downturn. Here we are again. Has Accel talked about downsizing the size of these massive pre-IPO and growth-stage global funds? In general, I don’t think we have seen that. So I haven’t read anything in the news where people have been cutting back the stage funds or fund commitments. I also think that we’re very close to the market adjusting again. We’ve done analysis of, okay, when did most of the big funding rounds happen, how long ago was that, what are reasonable assumptions for burn rates, what does that mean for companies having to fundraise again. And by most of our estimates, it feels like toward the end of the year and definitely in the beginning of next year, we should see the market normalizing again, so I think any kind of talk about smaller funds, etc., would be premature. Sometimes it feels like a domino effect. Somebody does it, then everyone else says that was the right thing to do; we should do that as well. It’s good that you think the markets are going to bounce back. At the same time, the numbers are not looking so great. I talk to secondary shops here in the U.S. from time to time and they’ve all said that it’s like trying to catch a falling knife here. Nobody really wants to sell their shares because they’re down so much. At the same time, buyers don’t want to buy yet because they think the shares will fall even further. And then yesterday, I saw that institutional LPs are selling some of their holdings at a 40% to 60% discount. Are your portfolio companies talking more actively with secondary platforms? Is Accel selling any of its holdings? No. We’ve been here before, right? So in 1999–2000, there was a massive funding cycle, and then of course, after 2001, that became very, very quiet again. So booms and busts are part of capitalism and hence also part of venture capitalism, so our approach is to really keep focusing on building large and valuable businesses, and over time, those large and valuable businesses will end up in windows where there is liquidity and then good stuff will happen. During the last few years, we had lots of growth, but it was also sometimes inefficient growth. We’re working on making them efficient and really building these companies into large and valuable businesses, and then that creates great outcomes for entrepreneurs, and it’ll also create great venture firms. Where are you looking in particular to make new bets? I know fintech is an area of interest for you, and that sector has been hammered obviously over the last year or so.  What are we looking at? Generative AI, of course, is a very fertile area for us to fund and look around. Security is always something of a gift that kind of keeps giving, as attackers and defenders come up with evermore powerful weapons to battle each other. We’ve particularly focused on security for big market companies but small businesses have not had the benefit of a lot of defense and a lot of security, so there’s a whole bunch of companies that are being formed now that help SMEs protect themselves from cybercrime. We also continue to do a lot in payments. And we’re funding a number of repeat entrepreneurs who have built large businesses before and are still quite young and want to do it again and want to possibly do it bigger. How has your pacing changed since we last talked? How long does it take Accel to write an initial check right now? It’s very different from the boom times. In the real boom [in 2020 and 2021], we had typically three or four days to decide on a deal. And that’s not good for the investors, but it’s also not good for the entrepreneurs because you end up working together for at least five to 10 years, and when you make a commitment like that, it’s good to get to know each other. Now the time we have to really familiarize ourselves with an investment opportunity and an entrepreneur is two or three weeks or so, which is much more normative, and it gives us an opportunity to get to know the entrepreneur but equally importantly, it gives the entrepreneur an opportunity to get to know us. Before the boom, a typical deployment period for a fund would be three years and it would be deployed in three years and [would feature] roughly 30 to 35 companies per fund. During the boom, that deployment period definitely went to two years and for many firms, sometimes a year and a half — even faster. And you don’t get enough time diversification into a fund like that, which makes venture funds more vulnerable. So now we’re back to what I would expect to be a three-year deployment cycle, with a [more traditional] period to really properly diligence an opportunity. So many bets were made during that period, and the fatality rate in the startup world is always high. How do you know that it is time to pull the plug? We are of the opinion that it’s always best for portfolio companies to raise fresh money from the outside, in good times and bad, because that kind of gives an outside market reality check as to the market as a whole. So the first litmus test is, is a company able to raise money from the outside? It doesn’t matter at what valuation. If they’re not able to raise money, that’s kind of a signal from the market. Are you more inclined to fund a founder who has returned capital to investors before running out of gas completely? If an entrepreneur says, “Listen, I don’t quite believe in it anymore because circumstances have changed, it’s a different market, I prefer to wind things up and give money back to investors and move on,” on a case-by-case basis, we’d be okay with that. It’s okay to admit that circumstances have changed and that the opportunity that you jointly thought was attractive is no longer. It happens. But it’s not something that we actively ask for. Typically, with entrepreneurs, we kind of we realize they’re in the driver’s seat, so we support them when they when they go public; we support them when they decide they want to sell. We also support them if they decide that circumstances have changed and it no longer makes sense to really go after their dream."
136,Joby Aviation lands $180M equity investment from returning backer Baillie Gifford,['@kirstenkorosec'],"May 3, 2023","Baillie Gifford is buying nearly 44 million newly issued shares in Joby Aviation, a purchase that will provide a $180 million injection of capital into the company as it continues to develop all-electric aircraft for a commercial passenger service. Joby Aviation said Wednesday as part of its first-quarter earnings report that it will sell 43,985,681 to the investing group at a price of $4.10 per share, a move that bolsters its balance sheet amid a stormy economic environment. The stock sale is expected to close May 5.  Joby Aviation shares closed Wednesday 1.49% higher at $4.10. Notably, Joby said the funds “are expected to be used to accelerate Joby’s early production, enabling the business to capitalize on near-term revenue opportunities without impacting the funds available to carry the company through to type certification of its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.” That “near-term revenue” opportunity is the key phrase here and connected to Joby’s announcement last week that it secured a $55 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense. Under that deal, Joby will produce and supply nine aircraft to the military. The first two will be delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in early 2024. “That’s a really critical milestone as we think about shifting gears from R&D into real operation and, in turn, real revenue for the first time,” Joby Chairman Paul Sciarra said in an interview Wednesday. Baillie Gifford’s investment allows Joby to protect its existing $978 million in cash, funds that are being used to develop and receive Federal Aviation Administration certification of its electric aircraft as well as launch a commercial taxi service, while also fulfilling its contract with the Department of Defense. “As we think about kind of steeping up that earlier production curve, building more aircraft than we might otherwise, delivering those to the new customer — when it comes to the sort of cash flow, you know, we felt like it made sense to ensure that we had a little bit more buffer so that we had an opportunity to really capitalize on what we think is a big opportunity, Sciarra explained on Wednesday’s earnings call. Baillie Gifford is already a Joby investor. In January 2020, the company invested $15 million as part of Joby’s $590 million Series C funding round that was led by Toyota. A year later, Baillie Gifford made a $49 million investment in the private investment in public equity (or PIPE) that was associated with Joby’s IPO via a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus. Joby has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify and produce an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that will be used as a commercial taxi service in cities. “Already in 2023 we’ve achieved significant milestones in production, testing and funding, and I’m incredibly excited about our progress as we move towards our goal of launching commercial service in 2025,” Joby founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt said in a statement. “The decision by Baillie Gifford to invest further in Joby is a testament to their long-term belief in the electrification of transportation and their track record speaks for itself. We couldn’t be more proud to have their support.” Joby reported Wednesday a net income loss of $113.4 million, an 82% increase from the $62.3 million loss in the same period last year. The company said the higher net loss compared to the first quarter in 2022 was primarily due to lower income of of $45.7 million and higher operating expenses of $5.4 million. Joby doesn’t generate revenue from its taxi service since the company is still in the process of certifying its aircraft. The reduction in other income was due to unfavorable revaluation of derivative liabilities in the first quarter and the non-recurrence of income from our equity method investment, partly offset by higher interest income on our short-term investments, according to the report. As any company that has yet to commercialize its product, Joby is spending capital. But the company did still have $978 million in cash and short-term marketable securities at the end of the quarter. That figure doesn’t include this fresh $180 million from Baillie Gifford. This story is developing …"
137,EU lawmakers eye tiered approach to regulating generative AI,['@riptari'],"April 21, 2023","EU lawmakers in the European parliament are closing in on how to tackle generative AI as they work to fix their negotiating position so that the next stage of legislative talks can kick off in the coming months. The hope then is that a final consensus on the bloc’s draft law for regulating AI can be reached by the end of the year. “This is the last thing still standing in the negotiation,” says MEP Dragos Tudorache, the co-rapporteur for the EU’s AI Act, discussing MEPs’ talks around generative AI in an interview with TechCrunch. “As we speak, we are crossing the last ‘T’s and dotting the last ‘I’s. And sometime next week I’m hoping that we will actually close — which means that sometime in May we will vote.” The Council adopted its position on the regulation back in December. But where Member States largely favored deferring what to do about generative AI — to additional, implementing legislation — MEPs look set to propose that hard requirements are added to the Act itself. In recent months, tech giants’ lobbyists have been pushing in the opposite direction, of course, with companies such as Google and Microsoft arguing for generative AI to get a regulatory carve out of the incoming EU AI rules. Where things will end up remains tbc. But discussing what’s likely to be the parliament’s position in relation to generative AI tech in the Act, Tudorache suggests MEPs are gravitating towards a layered approach — three layers in fact — one to address responsibilities across the AI value chain; another to ensure foundational models get some guardrails; and a third to tackle specific content issues attached to generative models, such as the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.   Under the MEPs’ current thinking, one of these three layers would apply to all general purpose AI (GPAIs) — whether big or small; foundational or non foundational models — and be focused on regulating relationships in the AI value chain. “We think that there needs to be a level of rules that says ‘entity A’ puts on the market a general purpose [AI] has an obligation towards ‘entity B’, downstream, that buys the general purpose [AI] and actually gives it a purpose,” he explains. “Because it gives it a purpose that might become high risk it needs certain information. In order to comply [with the AI Act] it needs to explain how the model was was trained. The accuracy of the data sets from biases [etc].” A second proposed layer would address foundational models — by setting some specific obligations for makers of these base models. “Given their power, given the way they are trained, given the versatility, we believe the providers of these foundational models need to do certain things — both ex ante… but also during the lifetime of the model,” he says. “And it has to do with transparency, it has to do, again, with how they train, how they test prior to going on the market. So basically, what is the level of diligence the responsibility that they have as developers of these models?” The third layer MEPs are proposing would target generative AIs specifically — meaning a subset of GPAIs/foundational models, such as large language models or generative art and music AIs. Here lawmakers working to set the parliament’s mandate are taking the view these tools need even more specific responsibilities; both when it comes to the type of content they can produce (with early risks arising around disinformation and defamation); and in relation to the thorny (and increasingly litigated) issue of copyrighted material used to train AIs. “We’re not inventing a new regime for copyright because there is already copyright law out there. What we are saying… is there has to be a documentation and transparency about material that was used by the developer in the training of the model,” he emphasizes. “So that afterwards the holders of those rights… can say hey, hold on, what you used my data, you use my songs, you used my scientific article — well, thank you very much that was protected by law, therefore, you owe me something — or no. For that will use the existing copyright laws. We’re not replacing that or doing that in the AI Act. We’re just bringing that inside.” The Commission proposed the draft AI legislation a full two years ago, laying out a risk-based approach for regulating applications of artificial intelligence and setting the bloc’s co-legislators, the parliament and the Council, the no-small-task of passing the world’s first horizontal regulation on AI. Adoption of this planned EU AI rulebook is still a ways off. But progress is being made and agreement between MEPs and Member States on a final text could be hashed out by the end of the year, per Tudorache — who notes that Spain, which takes up the rotating six-month Council presidency in July, is eager to deliver on the file. Although he also concedes there are still likely to be plenty of points of disagreement between MEPs and Member States that will have to be worked through. So a final timeline remains uncertain. (And predicting how the EU’s closed-door trilogues will go is never an exact science.) One thing is clear: The effort is timely — given how AI hype has rocketed in recent months, fuelled by developments in powerful generative AI tools, like DALL-E and ChatGPT. The excitement around the boom in usage of generative AI tools that let anyone produce works such as written compositions or visual imagery just by inputting a few simple instructions has been tempered by growing concern over the potential for fast-scaling negative impacts to accompany the touted productivity benefits. EU lawmakers have found themselves at the center of the debate — and perhaps garnering more global attention than usual — since they’re faced with the tricky task of figuring out how the bloc’s incoming AI rules should be adapted to apply to viral generative AI.   The Commission’s original draft proposed to regulate artificial intelligence by categorizing applications into different risk bands. Under this plan, the bulk of AI apps would be categorized as low risk — meaning they escape any legal requirements. On the flip side, a handful of unacceptable risk use-cases would be outright prohibited (such as China-style social credit scoring). Then, in the middle, the framework would apply rules to a third category of apps where there are clear potential safety risks (and/or risks to fundamental rights) which are nonetheless deemed manageable. The AI Act contains a set list of “high risk” categories which covers AI being used in a number of areas that touch safety and human rights, such as law enforcement, justice, education, employment healthcare and so on. Apps falling in this category would be subject to a regime of pre- and post-market compliance, with a series of obligations in areas like data quality and governance; and mitigations for discrimination — with the potential for enforcement (and penalties) if they breach requirements. The proposal also contained another middle category which applies to technologies such as chatbots and deepfakes — AI-powered tech that raise some concerns but not, in the Commission’s view, so many as high risk scenarios. Such apps don’t attract the full sweep of compliance requirements in the draft text but the law would apply transparency requirements that aren’t demanded of low risk apps. Being first to the punch drafting laws for such a fast-developing, cutting-edge tech field meant the EU was working on the AI Act long before the hype around generative AI went mainstream. And while the bloc’s lawmakers were moving rapidly in one sense, its co-legislative process can be pretty painstaking. So, as it turns out, two years on from the first draft the exact parameters of the AI legislation are still in the process of being hashed out. The EU’s co-legislators, in the parliament and Council, hold the power to revise the draft by proposing and negotiating amendments. So there’s a clear opportunity for the bloc to address loopholes around generative AI without needing to wait for follow-on legislation to be proposed down the line, with the greater delay that would entail.  Even so, the EU AI Act probably won’t be in force before 2025 — or even later, depending on whether lawmakers decide to give app makers one or two years before enforcement kicks in. (That’s another point of debate for MEPs, per Tudorache.) He stresses that it will be important to give companies enough time to prepare to comply with what he says will be “a comprehensive and far reaching regulation”. He also emphasizes the need to allow time for Member States to prepare to enforce the rules around such complex technologies, adding: “I don’t think that all Member States are prepared to play the regulator role. They need themselves time to ramp up expertise, find expertise, to convince expertise to work for the public sector. “Otherwise, there’s going to be such a disconnect between between the realities of the industry, the realities of implementation, and regulator, and you won’t be able to force the two worlds into each other. And we don’t want that either. So I think everybody needs that lag.” MEPs are also seeking to amend the draft AI Act in other ways — including by proposing a centralized enforcement element to act as a sort of backstop for Member State-level agencies; as well as proposing some additional prohibited use-cases (such as predictive policing; which is an area where the Council may well seek to push back). “We are changing fundamentally the governance from what was in the Commission text, and also what is in the Council text,” says Tudorache on the enforcement point. “We are proposing a much stronger role for what we call the AI Office. Including the possibility to have joint investigations. So we’re trying to put as sharp teeth as possible. And also avoid silos. We want to avoid the 27 different jurisdiction effect [i.e. of fragmented enforcements and forum shopping to evade enforcement].” The EU’s approach to regulating AI draws on how it’s historically tackled product liability. This fit is obviously a stretch, given how malleable AI technologies are and the length/complexity of the ‘AI value chain’ — i.e. how many entities may be involved in the development, iteration, customization and deployment of AI models. So figuring out liability along that chain is absolutely a key challenge for lawmakers. The risk-based approach also raises specific questions over how to handle the particularly viral flavor of generative AI that’s blasted into mainstream consciousness in recent months, since these tools don’t necessarily have a clear cut use-case. You can use ChatGPT to conduct research, generate fiction, write a best man’s speech, churn out marketing copy or pen lyrics to a cheesy pop song, for example — with the caveat that what it outputs may be neither accurate nor much good (and it certainly won’t be original). Similarly, generative AI art tools could be used for different ends: As an inspirational aid to artistic production, say, to free up creatives to do their best work; or to replace the role of a qualified human illustrator with cheaper machine output. (Some also argue that generative AI technologies are even more speculative; that they are not general purpose at all but rather inherently flawed and incapable; representing an amalgam of blunt-force investment that’s being imposed upon societies without permission or consent in a cripplingly-expensive and rights-trampling fishing expedition-style search for profit-making solutions.) The core concern MEPs are seeking to tackle, therefore, is to ensure that underlying generative AI models like OpenAI’s GPT can’t just dodge risk-based regulation entirely by claiming they have no set purpose. Deployers of generative AI models could also seek to argue they’re offering a tool that’s general purpose enough to escape any liability under the incoming law — unless there is clarity in the regulation about relative liabilities and obligations throughout the value chain. One obviously unfair and dysfunctional scenario would be for all the regulated risk and liability to be pushed downstream, onto only the deployers of specific high risks apps. Since these entities would, almost certainly, be utilizing generative AI models developed by other/s upstream — so wouldn’t have access to the data, weights etc used to train the core model — which would make it impossible for them to comply with AI Act obligations, whether around data quality or mitigating bias.   There was already criticism about this aspect of the proposal prior to the generative AI hype kicking off in earnest. But the speed of adoption of technologies like ChatGPT appears to have convinced parliamentarians of the need to amend the text to make sure generative AI does not escape being regulated. And while Tudorache isn’t in a position to know whether the Council will align with the parliamentarians’ sense of mission here, he says he has “a feeling” they will buy in — albeit, most likely seeking to add their own “tweaks and bells and whistles” to how exactly the text tackles general purpose AIs. In terms of next steps, once MEPs close their discussions on the file there will be a few votes in the parliament to adopt the mandate. (First two committee votes and then a plenary vote.) He predicts the latter will “very likely” end up being taking place in the plenary session in early June — setting up for trilogue discussions to kick off with the Council and a sprint to get agreement on a text during the six months of the Spanish presidency. “I’m actually quite confident… we can finish with the Spanish presidency,” he adds. “They are very, very eager to make this the flagship of their presidency.” Asked why he thinks the Commission avoided tackling generative AI in the original proposal, he suggests even just a couple of years ago very few people realized how powerful — and potentially problematic — these technology would become, nor indeed how quickly things could develop in the field. So it’s a testament to how difficult it’s getting for lawmakers to set rules around shapeshifting digital technologies which aren’t already out of date before they’ve even been through the democratic law-setting process. Somewhat by chance, the timeline appears to be working out for the EU’s AI Act — or, at least, the region’s lawmakers have an opportunity to respond to recent developments. (Of course it remains to be seen what else might emerge over the next two years or so of generative AI which could freshly complicate these latest futureproofing efforts.) Given the pace and disruptive potential of the latest wave of generative AI models, MEPs are sounding keen that others follow their lead — and Tudorache was one of a number of parliamentarians who put their names to an open letter earlier this week, calling for international efforts to cooperate on setting some shared principles for AI governance. The letter also affirms MEPs’ commitment to setting “rules specifically tailored to foundational models” — with the stated goal of ensuring “human-centric, safe, and trustworthy” AI. Together with @brandobenifei, as European Parliament co-rapporteurs on the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, I have initiated a political call to action on very powerful Artificial Intelligence uniting all major political groups in the Parliament working on the #AIAct. — Dragoș Tudorache (@IoanDragosT) April 17, 2023  He says the letter was written in response to the open letter put out last month — signed by the likes of Elon Musk (who has since been reported to be trying to develop his own GPAI) — calling for a moratorium on development of any more powerful generative AI models so that shared safety protocols could be developed. “I saw people asking, oh, where are the policymakers? Listen, the business environment is concerned, academia is concerned, and where are the policymakers — they’re not listening. And then I thought well that’s what we’re doing over here in Europe,” he tells TechCrunch. “So that’s why I then brought together my colleagues and I said let’s actually have an open reply to that.” “We’re not saying that the response is to basically pause and run to the hills. But to actually, again, responsibly take on the challenge [of regulating AI] and do something about it — because we can. If we’re not doing it as regulators then who else would?” he adds. Signing MEPs also believe the task of AI regulation is such a crucial one they shouldn’t just be waiting around in the hopes that adoption of the EU AI Act will led to another ‘Brussels effect’ kicking in in a few years down the line, as happened after the bloc updated its data protection regime in 2018 — influencing a number of similar legislative efforts in other jurisdictions. Rather this AI regulation mission must involve direct encouragement — because the stakes are simply too high. “We need to start actively reaching out towards other like minded democracies [and others] because there needs to be a global conversation and a global, very serious reflection as to the role of this powerful technology in our societies, and how to craft some basic rules for the future,” urges Tudorache.

138,Twitter will kill ‘legacy’ blue checks on April 1,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 23, 2023","Twitter has picked April Fool’s Day, otherwise known as April 1, to start removing legacy blue checkmarks from accounts that had them on the platform. Despite the significance of the day Twitter chose, the move has been anticipated for months now. Musk tweeted in December that the company would remove those checks “in a few months” because “the way in which they were given out was corrupt and nonsensical.” Since then, people with legacy blue checkmarks have been seeing a pop-up when they click on their checkmark that reads, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.”  Before Musk acquired the company, Twitter used checkmarks to verify individuals and entities as active, authentic and notable accounts of interest. Verified checkmarks were doled out for free. Today, Twitter users can purchase a blue check through the Twitter Blue subscription for $8 per month (iOS and Android signups will cost $11 per month due to app store costs). There are also other checkmark colors and badges available for purchase to denote whether an account belongs to a business or a government, for example. Twitter says the purchase of a checkmark gives users access to subscriber-only features, like fewer ads on their timeline, prioritized ranking in conversations, bookmark folders, and the ability to craft long tweets, edit tweets and undo tweets. The news comes just hours after Twitter made Blue subscriptions available globally. Twitter did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for information about how many users have already signed up for Twitter Blue."

Alemán, who has a background in microfinance, explained that lack of inclusion and access to capital in Latin America account for low loan penetration figures, in the low double digits in many cases. “We turn any lender into a fintech lender,” Alemán told TechCrunch. “Our goal is to increase financial inclusion in Latin America and empower small banks and credit unions to serve the underserved markets.” Kala’s lending dashboard Image Credits: Kala Kala’s lending dashboard Image Credits: Kala Kala officially launched in July 2022 and within the first six months had three customers, two in Colombia and one in Mexico, using the product and dispersing it to over 50,000 customers. Kala charges a SaaS fee and is already bringing in revenue, Alemán said. Now flush with capital, the company joins other fintechs — for example, Kredito, Mono and Marco Financial — providing avenues for businesses to get access to credit. The new funding, which closed in December, brings the company’s total funding to $6 million. It was led by Cometa and included existing investors Canary, Acrew, Clocktower and 99 Startups. The company currently has 28 employees and will deploy the capital into expansion of its product, tech, customer acquisition and customer support teams.

For his latest TC+ column, fintech consultant Grant Easterbrook examined three more ideas “that initially seemed promising but largely failed to change the financial services industry.” According to Easterbrook, these misfires offer valuable lessons to today’s founders and investors: “Fintech entrepreneurs must remember the essential principle that the average consumer doesn’t like thinking about money and often wants someone else to take care of it.”   Image Credits: Andrea Comi

141,Why the $830M gaming fund Bitkraft is bullish on Asia,['@ritacyliao'],"April 20, 2023","With $830 million in assets under management, Bitkraft Ventures has built a name for backing early- to mid-stage web3 games and other immersive technologies. After eight years of investing mostly in the West, the firm is extending its footprint to Asia to capture the continent’s savvy mobile gamers and fledgling web3 gaming space. Bitkraft, which has a portfolio of over 100 startups, announced today that it is expanding to Asia by bringing on two new members: Jin Oh, formerly president of Riot Games and CEO of Garena, will take the helm as partner; Jonathan Huang, former associate director at Temasek, will serve as principal. Currently, Bitkraft invests 15% outside of the Western market, with the majority in Asia. Over time, the firm aims to develop a dedicated strategy for the continent with the goal of increasing investments in Asia to 20-25%. Despite being a small team of two in the region, the fact that Bitkraft has boots on the ground in Asia gives it a big advantage over many other Western gaming funds, Huang, who’s based in Singapore, told TechCrunch in an interview. The team also benefits from the investors’ complementary experiences in the gaming industry. Oh “really knows the space very well as an operator… He’s very well connected and knows the ins and outs of building a game and a platform and all the adjacencies with gaming,” said Huang. “My background is very investor focused,” added the investor, who has been a lifelong gamer himself. “I came through two years of banking and did investments for the last six years… Having that operator-plus-investor combo is something that’s very, very powerful that we don’t see in many of the funds.” Oh and Huang will hunt down conventional gaming projects in Asia but will also allocate a big chunk of their time to high-potential blockchain games. The firm’s typical check size for seed investments in traditional equity is from $2-10 million; the checks are slightly smaller for web3 projects, ranging from $1 million to $5 million. The investors are going after a sector that is still very much a niche. Despite the billions of dollars poured into web3 gaming, the genre is mostly attracting crypto-native users for now. Investments for blockchain games reached $7.6 billion in 2022, more than double the sum from a year ago, according to analytics firm DappRadar; on average, though, just over one million unique active wallets were connected to game dApps (decentralized apps) daily last year (crypto wallets are channels for gamers to access and trade their in-game assets). The gaming industry overall, in comparison, is approaching three billion users by 2023, research firm Newzoo forecasted. Huang is nonetheless optimistic about blockchain-powered games, arguing that for the last few decades, breakthroughs in hardware have ushered in new innovation cycles — from arcade, console and PC to mobile games. The next innovation might not come from hardware but blockchain, which is in essence a database, he said. “If you use the existing mental model of hardware driving innovation, then this doesn’t work. So at one point, I was thinking to myself… maybe we don’t need hardware to drive new models of consumption… The crux of it is: Is this the new platform that is going to drive the next wave of innovation?” Given Bitkraft’s focus on web3, it makes total sense for the firm to set up in Asia where consumer appetite for blockchain games is huge. The play-to-earn hit Axie Infinity, for example, was made in Vietnam and accrued a loyal user base in Asian countries like the Philippines. While hardcore, purist gamers might dismiss Axie as a piece of mindless work with little creative value, Huang pointed out that it is “basically a card game” with a niche audience. “If you are someone that enjoys Hearthstone, or Legends of Runeterra, or any of those strategic card games, then you’ll like it,” he said. Most important, he reckoned that Asia is fundamentally different from the West in that its internet users are much more “open-minded.” “They are a lot more embracing [towards] new monetization models, new ways of playing games. This is where gacha games originated from, something that the West was very much against. We [Asians] are very good at monetizing our players, and people are okay with pay-to-win, to an extent,” the investor said. “I think that open-mindedness basically lends the Eastern market to be a bit more receptive of web3 gaming.

143,"Noya pivots to embrace modular direct air capture, lands $11M Series A",['@tdechant'],"April 17, 2023","Noya’s pitch a few years ago was pretty straightforward: lower the cost of capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by using existing industrial cooling towers, which are pretty much everywhere. Noya would inject its special carbon capture compounds into the tower’s water supply and after the water had done its cooling work, remove the carbon dioxide on the other end. That concept was good enough to get them into Y Combinator as part of the accelerator’s Winter 2021 cohort. The next year of work was fruitful, by all accounts. Then founders Josh Santos and Daniel Cavero pivoted. “We were getting ready to deploy that version of our technology later on this year,” Santos, CEO of Noya, told TechCrunch+. “We switched strategies late last year.” It wasn’t that their concept was failing, but the economics had changed drastically. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed into law in August 2022, boosted the incentive from $50 per metric ton to $180 per metric ton for companies that could capture 1,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year and store it underground. That meant ditching the cooling towers, which aren’t as a rule located near suitable storage sites. “We did some math to confirm, of course, but it was really exciting for us. And it was a pretty easy decision,” Santos said. “We made the decision in quarter four of last year to take the same direct air capture technology, that same filter, the same material, the same regeneration process, the same equipment designed, and essentially just add our own fan and deploy it right next to CO2 injection wells.” Noya’s approach to carbon capture is modular, involving an array of units that effectively operate independently. Each unit contains an activated carbon monolith that serves as scaffolding for their sorbent, the chemical that binds carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A fan blows air through the structure and, after about an hour, saturates the sorbent."
144,"Ring ring, Solana’s web3-focused Saga phone is calling",['@jacqmelinek'],"April 13, 2023"," About 10 months ago, Solana’s co-founder and CEO, Anatoly Yakovenko, announced the launch of Saga, a web3-focused Android smartphone. The phone is now being rolled out, and we got to test one ahead of its launch. Solana says Saga was launched to make crypto products and services more accessible for users by offering them through a phone instead of the traditional way of accessing crypto platforms and applications, which is via computers. I had an interesting few days using the Saga as my daily driver. Here’s what I thought about it. Let’s get the basics out of the way: The $1,000 device comes packaged in a black box that includes the phone itself, a USB-C charging cable and a physical seed phrase paper card so you can write down your recovery phrase, which is a sequence of random words that you need to access your crypto wallet. The phone’s operating system is based on Android 13, and it comes with 512 GB of storage with a 6.67-inch OLED display. The setup process is your standard Android experience, involving the usual prompts for setting up your account and internet connection. You can skip most of that and set it up later, but I’d recommend setting up the fingerprint unlock, as it also serves as a verification method for signing crypto transactions. I used Saga as my work phone for a few days. The phone’s 4011 mAh battery lasted me about 1.5 days starting at 82% on Monday night when I unboxed it to about 4% Wednesday morning. So I’d say it works well as far as battery life is concerned. The phone also has a built-in mobile wallet adapter, which is part of the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) that is invisible to users but is infrastructure that connects dApps to wallets, Steven Laver, the engineering lead at Solana Mobile, told TechCrunch. Similar to how MetaMask has a connect button on its desktop client, this adapter is a “comprehensive technology” that will bridge web dApps to mobile devices, he added. The device also includes a web3-focused feature, the Seed Vault, which is embedded into the phone. Users can import a seed phrase from another crypto wallet or create a new one (Solana recommends creating a new one). And that brings us to the core purpose of this phone’s existence: dApps. Unlike typical Android devices, the Saga has web3 features and a “Solana dApp Store,” where you can find apps for web3 platforms. The store has a slim handful of applications: Interestingly, Magic Eden isn’t on the list of dApp stores, even though the marketplace shared plans to partner with the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) last year when Saga was announced. After publication, Chris Akhavan, chief gaming officer at Magic Eden, told TechCrunch in a tweet its app would be live soon and is currently in a review state. When the phone is released to the public “in the next two weeks” the Solana team is hoping more applications will be added to the dApp store, but Laver did not disclose to TechCrunch how many the store would eventually house. “We’ve been reaching out and engaging with big players in the Solana ecosystem and those who recognize that mobile has won for everything else,” Laver said. “A lot of developers are realizing mobile will win eventually and they want to be there when it happens.” Saga owners get $20 worth of USDC and 0.01 SOL, or 0.0026 of a dollar, as part of the dApp store welcome pack. The 0.01 SOL was not enough to play around with some of the applications, so I had a friend send my new crypto wallet a few dollars worth of SOL to test out the dApps. The dApp Store currently gives Saga owners rewards, which includes an airdropped Saga genesis token, which is an NFT that provides access to rewards offered by dApps. The token is non-transferable and non-burnable, so users should make sure it’s not connected to a temporary wallet. We tested out the Minty Fresh dApp and minted a picture of ourselves for 0.01197 SOL within seconds. It now lives forever on the Solana blockchain and can be found here. The process itself was easy — and admittedly, fun — but using the phone was not the smoothest experience. The phone was sometimes slow, and I had to close and reopen dApps multiple times because the crypto wallet and NFT minting platform kept freezing. It’s worth noting that I faced these issues the whole time I used the device, not just with dApps. I found myself having to close applications, tap the screen a number of times to unlock it or use dApps, or even order myself an Uber. That’s not a problem you want to have with a brand new phone. Laver said that while the phone is still in its early stages, there will be software upgrades over time to keep things fresh. Last June, Yakovenko said the phone would be delivered in Q1 2023, but deliveries have since been pushed to Q2. The phone is available for preorder with a $100 deposit. A number of major web3 companies like crypto wallet Phantom, NFT marketplace Magic Eden and the now-collapsed crypto exchange FTX shared in June that they were partnering with Solana to help launch the phone, alongside a $10 million developer fund for people who build apps on it. This phone is an attempt for web3 to compete with Big Tech providers like Apple, Microsoft and, of course, Android — but many are skeptical of its potential to do so given its niche market. Last year, Yakovenko said the phone is “targeting the hardcore people who know what self-custody means. You gotta start with a group that loves this product and grow from there.” On the other hand, Laver sees this as a device for a bigger crypto audience. He said Saga’s team is planning a marketing push with crypto-native users as well as people who are “crypto curious.” “We want this to be someone’s phone,” Laver said. “This is the only phone I carry, I don’t have a second phone; it does everything a phone should do plus web3 things.” Laver didn’t disclose the exact number of phones that were preordered, but said the number was in the “high single digits of thousands.” The phone is certified for sale in 33 countries and the company plans to expand to other countries in the long term, he added. “We’re in this interesting place where we’re building interesting technologies, but also interested to see where people take it next,” Laver said. “We don’t have a roadmap of A, B or C. We’ve done ‘A’ of building this phone, but we’re excited to see where people take it next for ‘B’ and ‘C.’”"
145,Joby Aviation accelerates path to market with $55M DoD contract,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 26, 2023","Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company Joby Aviation’s strategy for launching commercially in 2025 is becoming more clear. The startup secured a $55 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense Tuesday, a deal that will allow the company to put its aircraft into customers’ hands and start generating revenue before it has achieved Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. That’s because Joby is pursuing two paths to market — a broader commercial service that requires FAA certification and a government service that requires military airworthiness from the DoD. The former includes certification of the aircraft design, production and maintenance, as well as pilot training and operating procedures. The latter is more focused on ensuring an aircraft meets the needs of military operations. In November, the FAA issued airworthiness criteria for Joby to certify its Model JAS4-1 aircraft to operate in U.S. airspace. The company had also previously received airworthiness approval from the Air Force for an uncrewed electric aircraft in 2020. When it comes to Joby’s other path to commercialization — which is similar to a rideshare app where customers pay to be transported via Joby’s air taxis — the company is chipping away at its FAA requirements. In February, Joby began final assembly on its company-conforming eVTOL, which is a prototype that’s a couple steps away from the final version. The company also completed the second stage of a process with the FAA to achieve type certification. Joby still has a few more stages in that process before it can move onto production certification, which will allow the company to mass-produce its eVTOLs. There’s a lot of overlap between the two paths to certification. Paul Sciarra, Joby executive chairman, says the value of that is twofold. “One is that we get to basically put product into the hands of customers a lot more quickly, generate revenue more quickly, but then also gain the learnings of what it takes to operate these aircraft, what it takes to train pilots, what it takes to dispatch the vehicles,” Sciarra told TechCrunch. “And we do that in a smaller, more controlled setting before bringing it to the broader consumer side.” The latest injection of capital from the DoD marks Joby’s third extension of its Agility Prime contract with the U.S. Air Force, an initiative launched in April 2020 to test, experiment and accelerate the development of eVTOL for cross commercial and military use. This week’s contract brings the total potential value of Joby’s current contract up to $131 million, according to the company. As part of the agreement, Joby will deliver and operate up to nine of its five-seat, low-noise electric aircraft, the first two of which are expected to be delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in California by spring 2024. Joby’s eVTOLs will be used to demonstrate logistics use cases, like transporting people and cargo, as well as potentially medical evacuations. Joby will retain ownership of the aircraft, while providing military pilots with flight training. The training sessions have already commenced at Joby’s manufacturing facility in Marina, California. Earlier this month, four pilots became the first Air Force personnel to fly Joby’s eVTOL through the full flight envelope, including transition from vertical to wingborne flight. The flights were piloted remotely from the ground, and the pilots were trained in a combination of classroom-based and simulator training, the company said. “This next step of getting Air Force pilots trained and operating Joby aircraft at an Air Force installation is an incredibly important milestone for the program, providing key insights to actual operations and use case validation for Advanced Air Mobility aircraft,” said Lt. Col. Tom Meagher, division lead of Agility Prime, in a statement. “Additionally, the Joby operations provide an outstanding opportunity for accelerated learning with the other Department of Defense services and government agencies, including NASA and the FAA.” Sciarra said Joby’s initial deployment is hopefully the first stage of even larger contracts with different government agencies over time.

146,Imgur will ban explicit images on its platform this month,['@indianidle'],"April 20, 2023","Image hosting platform Imgur is set to ban explicit images on its platform from May 15. The company updated its terms of service and said that the company will focus on removing “nudity, pornography, & sexually explicit content” from the site later this month. The MediaLab-owned company said that explicit content formed a risk to Imgur’s “community and its business” and disallowing such stuff will “protect the future of the Imgur community.” The image hosting platform said that it will still allow artistic nudity but as it is switching to a mix of automatic and human moderation, there might be issues in uploading certain content. “Artistic nudity will continue to be permitted, as it was permitted under the Rules previously – however, since we’re calibrating automated detection in these early stages, some content that may have been permitted under ‘artistic exceptions’ previously may not apply here. We will not be issuing any warnings, account suspensions, or bans in relation to these automated flags – but this may impact what is allowed to be submitted or uploaded,” Imgur said in its blog post. As Christian Selig, the developer behind Reddit client Apollo, pointed out, this change might impact several NSFW subreddits that rely on Imgur for explicit image hosting. Many Reddit users are familiar with Imgur because Reddit didn’t support image uploads at first. Users would rely on Imgur to upload images and then share them on Reddit. In 2018, Imgur stopped displaying images and search queries related to NSFW Reddit communities on Imgur’s website. At the time, the company said that explicit images were still allowed but had to be marked as “hidden”. The same year, Tumblr famously banned porn from its platform to comply with Apple’s App Store rules. Last year, the company introduced a “Community Labels” feature to let users filter out sensitive content easily. In addition to explicit images, Imgur is also removing old and unused photos that are not tied to an account. As a Twitter user noted, Imgur has been used for years to upload photos without an account and post links to different kinds of sites. Removing those images might result in a lot of dead links all over the internet.  We have asked the company to specify what is the definition of an “old and unused” photo and will update the story if we hear back. Notably, in 2017, another hosting service called Photobucket changed its terms and required users to get a $40 per month subscription to enable third-party hosting. This resulted in several broken links across many sites."

148,Ditto raises $45M to help companies keep their data in sync,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 19, 2023","Many apps today assume that data lives in only one location, typically a single cloud database. But the reality is more complex. Thanks to the proliferation of mobile devices and cloud infrastructure — the latter of which accelerated during the pandemic — apps now need to store and process data in more places, from the edge to the public cloud. That’s what drove Adam Fish and Max Alexander to found Ditto, which emerged from stealth today with $45 million in Series A funding led by Acrew Capital with participation from U.S. Innovative Technology Fund (USIT), True Ventures and Amity Ventures. Ditto provides a distributed database that runs “practically anywhere,” according to Fish and Alexander, enabling data distribution even in areas with limited or poor internet connectivity. “The pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in traditional network infrastructure, prompting a surge in demand for contactless solutions,” Fish, who serves as the company’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Businesses scrambled to transition their everyday processes to contactless alternatives; however, these applications often relied on an internet connection to function effectively. Ditto’s platform emerged as a solution to these challenges.” At a high level, Ditto provides a database that runs across edge devices and in the cloud, allowing developers to store and sync data peer-to-peer across mobile and edge devices. Developers can use it to subscribe to data that they need or want to see. Ditto works across Bluetooth, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and local wired networks to automatically find and connect to other devices and then synchronize data. Changes to data locally will offline sync once Ditto discovers cloud or peer devices, according to Fish. Ditto offers different versions of its cloud database, from a tenant in a shared environment to dedicated environments that are managed in a customer’s own cloud account. Developers can opt to use the platform’s APIs or query-based sync — or both, depending on their needs. Image Credits: Ditto Image Credits: Ditto “By operating independently of an internet connection, Ditto’s platform enables industries to swiftly adopt contactless solutions, bolstering their apps and processes with added resiliency and redundancy,” Fish said. “This reduces the risk of downtime and potential revenue loss, allowing businesses to continue operations even in the face of connectivity issues.” The market for enterprise file sync and share tools could be worth $12.84 billion by 2026, according to Technavio. So it’s not surprising, really, that Ditto isn’t the only startup competing for a slice of it. There’s Whalesync, which transfers data between a range of software-as-a-service apps. PieSync connects cloud apps and syncs contacts stored in those apps two-way. And the open source, Airbyte-owned Grouparoo replicates info between databases and cloud-based tools. Fish doesn’t argue that Ditto is massively differentiated in any way, save that it has a respectable customer base numbering in the “tens of thousands,” including brands such as Alaska Airlines, Japan Airlines, Hugo and Lufthansa. Ditto maintains several active government and military contracts as well, Fish says, including a deal worth up to $950 million with the U.S. Air Force. “Strategic shifts in recent years led to a focus on resilient information sharing as a top priority across the U.S. government and allies,” Fish said. “In addition, the austere conditions and greater demands push our technology further in ways that are complementary to commercial use cases. With Ditto, strategic and tactical responders can communicate even in the face of damaged infrastructure, congested channels, dynamically formed disaster response teams, communication impediments, poor interoperability and security attacks. Ditto’s focus over the next few months will be expanding its software development kit and further commercializing its tech, Fish says, as well as acquiring customers in industries like travel, education and retail. “While the company was not in need of funding, we decided to raise so we could invest across customer-facing roles in sales and support,” Fish said. “Ditto aims to be the world’s next great database that runs everywhere — across cloud providers to edge servers and mobile devices.” Thomas Tull, the chairman of USIT, had this to say via email: “With technology permeating every aspect of our lives, the break-neck advances Ditto is making in data management and accessibility are crucial to the future of how data is managed and accessed. Ditto’s developments have a tremendous number of applications across sectors — from everyday life to business to the Pentagon — and that is why the work they are doing is so essential.” Mum’s the word on Ditto’s revenue. But Fish did reveal that the startup, which has raised $54 million to date, inclusive of a $9 million seed round closed in November 2021, plans to grow its workforce from 65 people to over 100 by the end of the year."
149,Dylibso raises $6.6M to help developers take WebAssembly to production,['@fredericl'],"March 24, 2023","WebAssembly (Wasm for short) is an open standard that enables browser-based applications to run with near-native performance. It has also expanded to support non-browser environments, which is what is driving a lot of the recent hype around it. But like any emerging technology, it needs a stronger tooling ecosystem to realize its full potential. One of the companies that’s pushing in this direction is Dylibso, a startup that has made it its mission to help development teams take Wasm to production. The company, which is announcing a $6.6 million seed funding round at the Wasm I/O conference in Barcelona today, made a name for itself with Extism, its open source universal plug-in system that allows developers to integrate WebAssembly into their existing non-WebAssembly codebase. It’s also launching Modsurfer, a system of record and diagnostic tool for WebAssembly, into general availability today. The company’s funding round was led by Felicis, with participation from Boldstart Ventures, Pebblebed and Crew Capital. Dylibso co-founder and CEO Steve Manuel previously worked at Cloudflare, where he brought Wasm support to that company’s Workers product, as well as at quantum computing startup Rigetti Computing. Extism logo. Image Credits: Dylibso Extism logo. Image Credits: Dylibso “As someone who likes other languages more than JavaScript — just to put it nicely — I thought: you know, I got to use this WebAssembly runtime to bring another language to Cloudflare workers,” Manuel said. As a side project, he built a framework that compiled to WebAssembly from Rust and integrated with Cloudflare’s APIs. But in the process, he also realized that once this code was running in production, he had no real observability into how it was running, making debugging a challenge. “There are lots and lots of places — and lots and lots of existing code and runtimes — in which developers would love to shim a little bit of their language of choice,” he explained. “WebAssembly gives you a great solution from a security and performance standpoint to be able to run that code reliably inside another environment, but compiled from a different language.” And that’s the core of the idea behind Extism, which Dylibso launched in December 2022. It’s an open source plug-in system that allows developers to run any code that can be compiled to WebAssembly inside of any program that’s previously been written in a different language. “The goal is really to make it as easy as possible to integrate WebAssembly into your program, whether your program already uses Wasm or not. Doesn’t matter. It makes it easy to do,” Manuel said. He stressed that it is not a commercial product but primarily meant to accelerate the adoption of WebAssembly — especially for code that runs outside of the browser. Modsurfer aims to fix Manuel’s other problem: understanding how WebAssembly code runs in production — and why it may fail. It’s available for free to developers, but it’s also Dylibso’s first commercial product, as it will offer an enterprise version of Modsurfer as well. Image Credits: Dylibso Image Credits: Dylibso “Modsurfer gives you this single pane of glass for all of the WebAssembly code that you’re interested in and keeping track of,” Manuel explained. It’s meant to be part system-of-record, allowing developers to keep track of all of the WebAssembly code they are running, and part analysis tool for this code. Since WebAssembly is a binary format, the code sits in a bit of a black box that Modsurfer aims to crack open these modules for developers. It analyzes the code (and can often detect what language it was originally written in) and returns data about its complexity, imports and exports, namespaces and more. “We analyze and conduct what’s called a cyclomatic complexity analysis, where we actually determine the risk profile of running this code in your environment,” said Manuel. Modsurfer is now generally available. Image Credits: Dylibso Image Credits: Dylibso “Developers often struggle to use WebAssembly due to the technology’s lack of tooling,” said Paul Nashawaty, principal analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. “We are seeing in our research and expect the market for WebAssembly and its value to developers to rival — if not be larger — than container adoption, but the right tools need to be available to help developers through the entire development lifecycle and bring WebAssembly into production. Dylibso enables developers to easily use WebAssembly with a suite of products that help them integrate WebAssembly and gain critical insight and visibility into their binary code.”    "
150,"BrightDrop signs Ryder as customer, starts first Zevo 600 deliveries",['@rebeccabellan'],"April 3, 2023","BrightDrop, the electric delivery van subsidiary of General Motors, has signed on supply chain logistics company Ryder as a new customer. Ryder plans to add 4,000 BrightDrop EVs to their rental and lease fleet through 2025. The nabbing of yet another big commercial customer comes as BrightDrop demonstrates its ability to deliver EVs at scale. The company said Monday it has started to ship more than 500 of its Zevo 600 delivery vans, which are built at the high-volume CAMI Assembly manufacturing facility in Ontario, Canada. For comparison, Rivian, one of BrightDrop’s commercial competitors, has already delivered around 3,000 electric vans to Amazon, according to the e-commerce giant’s blog. By 2030, Amazon hopes to bring 100,000 Rivian delivery vehicles to the roads. In Rivian’s fourth-quarter earnings report, the EV-maker set a goal of producing 50,000 units this year, but those won’t all be delivery vans. Rivian also produces the R1S pickup truck and R1T SUV. With all the backing of GM, BrightDrop reckons it can do better. The company started production at CAMI in December, when it announced DHL Express Canada as its first Canadian customer. BrightDrop says it is on track to produce 50,000 Zevo vans annually by 2025, with production scheduled to ramp up throughout the year. The company, which already sold out of 2023 model year Zevo 600s, will have to meet those high unit numbers in order to appease its more than 30 commercial customers. At GM’s investor day in November, BrightDrop reported it had received more than 25,000 reservations and letters of intent from customers, including FedEx, Walmart, Hertz, WasteNot Compost and more. Ryder’s order of 4,000 BrightDrop EVs will be a mix of Zevo 600s and Zevo 400s, which have a cargo capacity of over 600 and 400 cubic feet, respectively. Ryder will order the first 200 vans this year, mainly 2023 Zevo 600s, which it will deploy in rental fleets in California, Dallas-Fort Worth and New York City later this year. Ryder said in a statement it intends to add some 2024 Zevo 600s and 400s to the fleet this year and next. BrightDrop on Monday began taking reservations for those vehicles, and expects to begin deliveries by mid-year 2023. The increased demand for BrightDrop’s vehicles might help the company reach its previously stated goal of bringing in $1 billion in revenue this year. While a big chunk of that potential revenue will come from vehicles, BrightDrop is also hoping to leverage a SaaS product, BrightDrop Core. The subscription-based software platform, unveiled at GM’s investor day last November, aims to provide customers with detailed insights into their operations. The platform is expected to launch this year."
151,Colorado’s new right-to-repair law ensures tractor and wheelchair owners get the parts they need,['@techcrunch'],"April 25, 2023","Colorado’s governor signed a refreshingly straightforward “right-to-repair” bill into law this afternoon, requiring companies to provide resources like parts, firmware and manuals for devices that they previously kept secret and proprietary even if an owner wanted to do the repairs themselves. Colorado’s “Consumer Repair Bill of Rights Act” is one of many such bills that have been proposed over the years, and is among the simplest, having graduated from a bill intended to help wheelchair owners do their own repairs to covering all “agricultural equipment” as well. As those in the intellectual property and hardware obsolescence space likely know, farms have become an unlikely frontier for change in the tech world due to companies like John Deere growing inflexible regarding the repair of their vehicles and devices. A tractor, in these days of precision agriculture, is of course more than simply a replacement for a pair of oxen — it’s as high-tech as any modern car, with GPS, automation, software updates and all the rest. And like many cars, repairs of some parts have become impossible to perform by owners — and increasingly even specialists. Replacing a tire, no problem — but more complicated issues or accidents have increasingly required the vehicle to be brought in to the manufacturer or an authorized agent, the only people in possession of the proprietary parts or even access to the software running on the things. This long ago passed from inconvenience to serious problem for many people, and tractors have become a sort of stand-in for tech in general that people feel locked out of maintaining for themselves — inasmuch that the manufacturers have deliberately excluded them in order to reap the benefits of being the exclusive repair shop for every tractor they sell. The question many have asked, as with phones, computers and other forms of tech, is simply: If you can’t repair it simply because they won’t let you, can you really say you own it? HB23-1011 applies strictly to farm stuff like combines, sprayers, balers and so on, as well as the powered wheelchairs that were its original target. The manufacturers thereof are required to: provide parts, embedded software, firmware, tools, or documentation, such as diagnostic, maintenance, or repair manuals, diagrams, or similar information (resources), to independent repair providers and owners of the manufacturer’s agricultural equipment to allow an independent repair provider or owner to conduct diagnostic, maintenance, or repair services on the owner’s agricultural equipment. And this at reasonable cost that does not disincentivize people from doing their own repairs. Failure to do this will be classified as a deceptive trade practice. The law has two caveats: The manufacturer is not obligated to “divulge any trade secrets” in the process of complying, and owners or repair providers are not allowed to deactivate safety mechanisms or infringe on copyright or patent laws. That last bit may prove a sticky one, but it would not have been allowed anyway — mentioning it is more of a “and just so you know” rather than a statutory prohibition. “I am proud to sign this important bipartisan legislation that saves hardworking farmers and ranchers time and money on repairs, and supports Colorado’s thriving agriculture industry,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis in a statement accompanying the signing of this and other bills today. “This is a common-sense bipartisan bill to help people avoid unnecessary delays from equipment repairs. Farmers and ranchers can lose precious weeks and months when equipment repairs are stalled due to long turnaround times by manufacturers and dealers. This bill will change that.” He calls out State Representative Brianna Titone for her leadership on this; I contacted her for comment and she offered the following statement: This bill has been a long time coming for the Ag community and is a major milestone in fostering real ownership of purchased equipment. Just this year, 16 states have proposed bills on agricultural equipment. In January 2024, farmers will finally have more repair options to keep them in the fields and out of the repair shops. We believe that with any new law there’s always a possibility of a lawsuit. However, the initial indications show John Deere is already making efforts to provide the materials the law requires. There have been calls for nationwide right-to-repair laws, but like everything else they tend to get bogged down in partisan politics or maneuvering. Colorado’s law is straightforward and simple enough to serve not just as an example, but a flexible and generalizable example of a law other states could adopt. No doubt the industries impacted negatively (mostly farm equipment dealers, one imagines, as well as the corporations that manufacture the gear) will have something to say about this. But they’ll survive — John Deere in February reported just a hair shy of $2 billion in quarterly profits, more than doubling its net income year over year. From its growing self-repair resources, the company seems to have seen the writing on the wall as well."
152,SEGA workers are forming a union,['@asilbwrites'],"April 24, 2023","A group of 144 workers are forming a union at SEGA’s American headquarters in Irvine, California. SEGA follows in the footsteps of workers at other gaming companies like Microsoft-owned ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, which both unionized last year. The gaming giant behind franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog and Total War, SEGA has not yet voluntarily recognized the union or responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment. If SEGA does not recognize the union, the eligible workers can conduct an election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB); workers expect that this vote would pass, since there are only about 170 eligible workers, and a supermajority has already joined the union.  SEGA’s union stands out from its peers in the gaming industry’s burgeoning labor movement, since it spans across departments. Union members, who organized through the Communications Workers of America (CWA), work in marketing, product design, localization, quality assurance and more. Em Geiger, a temp editor in localization who has been at SEGA since 2018, thinks that the union was able to unite multiple departments because workers have had the opportunity to connect with their peers across disciplines. “There are opportunities for different departments to mingle and to get to know one another,” Geiger told TechCrunch, citing examples like all-hands “shout out” meetings, where employees are encouraged to publicly acknowledge their co-workers’ achievements. “This turned from just wanting to better the workplace that we are in to wanting to ensure that our co-workers and friends across departments receive better treatment than what they’re currently getting.”  Geiger says that this unionization effort has been in the works for a long time, and was not a direct response to union efforts at other gaming companies. However, the successful union efforts at other studios have been affirming. “It certainly did inspire confidence, seeing so many other gaming companies finally asserting their rights to organize, and going public with their efforts,” they said. “We are very lucky to be riding this wave of people who are starting to show more support for the idea of unions in general.” The union, known as AEGIS-CWA (Allied Employees Guild Improving SEGA), is advocating for higher base pay, improved benefits like healthcare, retirement and remote work options, clearer opportunities for advancement, and increased staffing to combat overwork and burnout. The concept of “crunch” — or, working extreme hours to meet a deadline to release a game — is endemic to the gaming industry, spurring this sudden movement of unionization at studios. Microsoft, which houses many gaming divisions, has a legally binding labor neutrality agreement, which means that it will not stand in the way of union organizing. This isn’t the norm in the tech sphere. Activision Blizzard, which is expected to become part of Microsoft if its merger isn’t blocked by the government, has been found by the NLRB to have unlawfully retaliated against unionizing workers. When it comes to SEGA, temp QA tester Winry Ramsey, who has been in this role since August, isn’t quite sure how the company will respond. “It’s too early to tell on that one,” Ramsey told TechCrunch. “I’m mostly just excited with how much public support we already have.”    "
153,Netflix’s ad-supported plan gets support for 1080p quality and two concurrent streams,['@indianidle'],"April 19, 2023","Netflix is upgrading its ad-supported plan in terms of streaming quality and concurrent streams. The company said users subscribed to this plan will be able to see content in 1080p resolution (up from 720p) with support for two concurrent streams. These benefits are rolling out to users in Canada and Spain today. People using the ad-supported plans in other 10 markets — including the U.S. — will get these features this month. “We believe these enhancements will make our offering even more attractive to a broader set of consumers and further strengthen engagement for existing and new subscribers to the ads plan,” the company said in its letter to investors. Netflix launched the ad-supported plan last November at $6.99 per month and it’s already seeing positive results. The streaming company said that in the U.S., it’s earning more average revenue per membership through the ad-supported plan than the standard plan, which costs $15.99 per month. During the earnings call, Netflix’s CFO Spencer Neumann said that the company has rolled out new content to the ad-supported tier in the past quarter, bringing it to “95% plus” parity with other higher-priced plans. He mentioned that the ad-supported plan is also showing beneficial results for the business. “This [economics of the ad-supported plan] is all at a level that we believe is not just better for our members with a lower priced option but better for our business and we think we could do it with and are doing it in a way that’s, I would say, without being overly specific, think of it as like 50% or more incremental profit contribution to the business,” he said. According to Insider Intelligence, Netflix will bring in $770 million in ad revenues this year, and this number will grow to $1.9 billion in 2024. Netflix ad revenue.

154,Babylon raises $8M for its self-contained vertical farming system,['@bheater'],"April 3, 2023","Personal vertical farms — that’s the big promise driving Babylon Micro-Farms. The Richmond, Virginia-based startup produces the Galleri, a large $15,000 wall appliance designed to grow more than 50 different plant varieties for on-site harvest. The system is obviously price-prohibitive for most individuals at the moment; accordingly, the company is currently focused on food service for verticals like healthcare, education and the corporate world. Anyone who has a desire for hyper-local produce (and a nice visual to boot). Today Babylon is announcing an $8 million Series A, led by Venture South. The round, which also features Virginia Venture Partners, Hull Street Capital and New Theory Ventures, follows a $3 million seed announced almost exactly two years ago. It arrives as the startup is also announcing $500,000 National Science Foundation grant. Babylon is still a lean team of 35, based primarily based in Richmond. The Galleri system is currently manufactured locally, as well. CEO Alexander Olesen tells TechCrunch that the money will go toward accelerating production and marketing the solution, as the company looks to expand its install base. “We have designed the BabylonIQ platform to manage a distributed fleet of vertical farms at scale,” says Olesen. “The proprietary platform we’ve developed automatically controls growing conditions, scheduling planting/harvesting and reordering supplies while we are able to conduct real-time analysis of plant health and predictive maintenance on our fleet. This ensures healthy crops and happy customers at scale. This is a key technological innovation that needed to happen in order to make modular growing systems successful.” While the systems are self-contained, the modularity in question refers to their ability to be linked together in a single location. On its own, one system is capable of producing up to 24 pounds of leafy greens a month. Given the produce pricing, however, microgreens offer users a much stronger return on investment potential buyers balking at the price tag. For those who don’t want to buy a system outright, Babylon also offers a hardware-as-a-service subscription pricing option."
155,"After losing sight of its initial pitch, Mojo Vision eyes pivot with $22.4M raise",['@bheater'],"April 5, 2023","News of Mojo Vision’s pivot rather poetically dropped during CES. After years of trying out the latest iteration of the company’s smart contact lens in various Las Vegas hotel suites, I found myself typing up this news sitting in the hallway of the Wynn, waiting to talk to an HTC executive about their VR play. The entire notion of a viable smart contact lens felt like a bit of a pipe dream in those early days — a notion seemingly solidified by those pesky market forces. It was a bold and exciting vision, mind — just one economic and technological forces aren’t quite ready to crack at the moment. The firm announced at the time that it was putting the project on hold and laying off a jaw-dropping 75% of its staff. It also did the thing startups are supposed to do in those sorts of situations: focusing on something more immediately viable to survive treacherous headwinds. “Although we haven’t had the chance yet to see it ship and to reach its full potential in the marketplace, we have proven that what was once considered science fiction can be developed into a technical reality,” (now former) CEO Drew Perkins wrote at the time. “Even though the pursuit of our vision for Invisible Computing is on hold for now, we strongly believe that there will be a future market for Mojo Lens and expect to accelerate it when the time is right.” While the news felt like a definitive end, Mojo is making good on its promised pivot. Moving forward, the company is commercializing the micro-LED display tech at the heart of its lenses. This morning it announced a $22.4 million raise that it’s referring to as a “new Series A” (presumably delineated by its major pivot). Still, there are existing backers who believe in the new mission to pony up for this new round, including NEA and Khosla Ventures. New investors include Dolby Family Ventures, Liberty Global Ventures, Fusion Fund, Drew Perkins, Open Field Capital and Edge. Certainly there’s a much larger addressable market for the component’s tech at the moment — and a more manageable roadmap to boot. Here are some specs/details about the technology from the company: While Perkins remains an investor, the former SVP and GM of Mojo’s micro-LED business, Nikhil Balram, is stepping into the CEO role. “This round of funding will enable us to deliver our breakthrough monolithic micro-LED technology to customers and help bring high-performance micro-LEDs to market,” he says in the release. Prior to joining Mojo Vision, Balram served as the CEO of AR company EyeWay Vision and did R&D for various Google hardware projects, including its various AR/VR plays."

In fact, a small news item from today reinforces our view that the list of companies we’re earmarking as strong possibles for an IPO when the window for public debuts opens is getting rather long. It’s even more extensive than we know, given the number of late-stage software startups that have likely reached public-company revenue scale and, provided that the economy holds up this year, are likely growing quickly enough to pursue an IPO if they are willing to settle for a smaller valuation. But the list is long indeed: Several startups that have said they are eyeing a debut are making the right hires or simply have IPO filings in the wings. Let’s talk about who we have in mind. We’ll start with some new entrants to our list of late-stage startups that are gearing up for a public offering: Remote makes for a good segue to a group of companies we’ve been writing about quite a bit lately:"
157,Apple TV+ announces new series ‘The Savant’ inspired by true story of a woman who infiltrates online hate groups,['@laurenforristal'],"March 28, 2023","Apple TV+ is getting a new limited series, the company announced yesterday, that is about a deep-cover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to prevent violent attacks and mass shootings. “The Savant” will have eight episodes and stars Jessica Chastain. The show is inspired by the true story published in 2019 by Cosmopolitan writer Andrea Stanley, who will consult on the Apple TV+ series. A release date has yet to be announced. Stanley’s article, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” is one that will send chills down your spine. But that’s probably a familiar feeling by now. Many of us are already aware of the mass influx of hate speech on the internet. “The chase of getting the bad guy? Oh, man, that feels good,” K, the anonymous investigator with the alias “The Savant,” told Stanley. The nickname stems from K’s keen ability to track hateful men online and determine if/when they’ll go from trolling misogynists, white supremacists or other extremists hiding behind computer screens to violent, frightening murderers. According to the article, K has reported tons of violent men to the FBI, such as Michael Finton, a 29-year-old who posted disturbing videos of Islamic extremists on Myspace and would later attempt to bomb the Paul Findley Federal Building in Springfield, Illinois. Besides her profession, not much else is known about K, except that she joined the Marine Corps after graduating from high school, has a degree in justice and public safety and studied rapists and murderers when she worked for a state-run agency that reinvestigates capital-murder cases. K eventually applied for a job with the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) to monitor online hate groups. Apple didn’t share in its press release how similar the series will be to the Cosmopolitan story. “The storyline and character details are being kept under wraps,” the company wrote in the announcement. Online hate, misinformation and harassment have circulated the internet for quite some time. In 2018, the ADL found that 37% of Americans were subjected to extreme hate online. And while the January 6 United States Capitol attack in 2021 urged tech companies like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to incite policies to identify and remove harmful content, reports continue to come out about major social media platforms failing to curb online hate. Lately, Twitter CEO Elon Musk has been under fire after restoring problematic accounts, including Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin (@WorldWarWang), and his overall leniency toward toxic internet culture. Earlier this month, YouTube updated its profanity rules, which are more relaxed about the use of strong language. The platform also unsuspended Trump’s YouTube channel."
158,iMessage and more finally comes to Windows with global rollout of Phone Link for iOS,['@sarahintampa'],"April 26, 2023","iMessage is finally coming to Windows. Microsoft today announced that Phone Link for iOS is now rolling out to all Windows 11 customers, allowing iPhone users to make and receive phone calls, send and receive messages via iMessage, access their contacts and see their phone’s notifications directly on their Windows PC. The feature had previously been available as an early preview to Windows Insiders. Now, Microsoft says Phone Link for iOS on Windows 11 will begin rolling out to its global customer base in 39 languages across 85 markets. Though the rollout starts today, it may take a few weeks to reach the full customer base, the company noted. Despite being available to Android users for some time, iPhone users have not had a similar option for staying connected with their friends and family through their PC. The lack of support for Windows likely kept some consumers from exploring the Windows PC ecosystem, as they wanted a more seamless experience when moving in between their devices. But given how prevalent the use of Windows is within the business and personal computing worlds, that also meant that both Apple and Microsoft were massively underserving their respective — and overlapping — customer bases. For business professionals, one advantage of Phone Link is that they can now respond to texts, track calls and view incoming notifications more discreetly — for example, while in a meeting where pulling out your iPhone may feel unprofessional. At other times, iPhone owners may want to charge their phone before heading out, but can still keep up with their calls, texts and notifications while the phone is plugged in elsewhere. Image Credits: Microsoft Image Credits: Microsoft To get started with Phone Link, users are guided through a setup process that will pair their iPhone to their PC over Bluetooth. This includes scanning a QR code shown on the screen confirming the phone by matching a code shown on the iPhone to the code displayed in Phone Link. When pairing is complete, users are asked to grant a set of permissions that allows content to be synced to their PC. As the last step, Phone Link will direct users to grant permissions on their iPhone within the phone’s Bluetooth settings which is what will allow them to receive their phone’s notifications on their PC and access their contacts. When setup is complete, Phone Link will then offer basic support for calls, messages and contacts, but it has some limitations. For example, it won’t support replying to group messages or sending media in messages. And because the messages are session-based, they’ll only come through when the phone is directly connected to the PC. Notifications, meanwhile, will be delivered to the PC through Windows notifications. That means users can check them, pin them and dismiss them from the Windows interface. Phone Link requires an iPhone with iOS 14 or higher, Windows 11, a Bluetooth connection and the latest version of the Phone Link app, which is preinstalled with Windows 11. Support is not available for iPad (iPadOS) or MacOS at this time."
159,"After much delay, Apple finally launches Apple Pay Later",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 28, 2023","Months after unveiling a major update to Apple Pay called Apple Pay Later, which allows users to split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase into four equal payments over six weeks without interest or late fees, Apple has finally launched the feature. But not for everyone — at least not yet. Starting today, Apple says it’ll begin inviting randomly selected users to access a pre-release version of Apple Pay Later, with plans to offer it to all “eligible” users on iOS 16.4 or iPadOS 16.4 in the coming months. Apple Pay Later was supposed to debut with iOS 16, but technical and engineering issues delayed its release, Bloomberg reported earlier in the year. The lucky Apple Pay users selected will be able to apply for Apple Pay Later loans of $50 to $1,000, which can be put toward online and in-app purchases made on iPhone and iPad with merchants that accept Apple Pay. To get started with Apple Pay Later, users can apply for a loan within the Wallet app on iOS. They’ll then be prompted to enter the amount they’d like to borrow and agree to the Apple Pay Later terms. A soft credit pull will be performed during the application process, Apple says, and — after a user is approved — they’ll see a “Pay Later” option when they select Apple Pay at checkout online and in apps on iPhone and iPad. Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple A user’s Apple Pay Later loan payments are displayed in Wallet. A calendar view shows a user what’s due for all of their loans over a 30-day period. Apple isn’t technically offering Apple Pay Later itself. Rather, the credit assessment and lending is being handled by Apple Financing, a subsidiary, which plans to report Apple Pay Later loans to U.S. credit bureaus starting sometime this fall. As for the merchant side, Apple Pay Later is enabled through the Mastercard Installments program, with Goldman Sachs serving as the issuer of the Mastercard payment credential used to complete all Apple Pay Later purchases. Apple Pay Later goes head-to-head with buy now, pay later (BNPL) services from PayPal, Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle and countless others. Grand View Research predicts that the BNPL could be worth $39.41 billion by 2030. To wit, BNPL remains incredibly popular among consumers. More than 51% of Americans said that they’d tried a BNPL service as of March 2021, according to one survey. And Accenture estimates that the number of BNPL users in the U.S. reached 45 million in 2021. Image Credits: Apple Pay Image Credits: Apple Pay But BNPL products are under increasing scrutiny from regulators, some of whom argue that the BNPL business model is unnecessarily risky. In a survey last year by Credit Karma, more than a third of respondents who’d taken advantage of BNPL plans reported falling behind on payments. “There’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to how people manage their finances. Many people are looking for flexible payment options, which is why we’re excited to provide our users with Apple Pay Later,” Apple VP of Apple Pay and Wallet Jennifer Bailey said in a press release. “Apple Pay Later was designed with our users’ financial health in mind, so it has no fees and no interest, and can be used and managed within Wallet, making it easier for consumers to make informed and responsible borrowing decisions.”"
160,"FBI seizes Genesis Market, a notorious hacker marketplace for stolen logins",['@carlypage_'],"April 5, 2023","U.S. and international law enforcement agencies have seized Genesis Market, a notorious hacker marketplace used to acquire compromised credentials and digital browser fingerprints. The FBI announced the takedown, dubbed “Operation Cookie Monster,” on Wednesday. Genesis Market domains now display a notice stating that U.S. law enforcement officials have executed a seizure warrant. “Genesis Market’s domains have been seized by the FBI pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin,” the message reads. In addition to the FBI, the notice says the takedown involved law enforcement agencies from the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada, Germany, Poland and Sweden. The operation also saw about 120 people arrested and 200 searches carried out globally. The U.K.’s National Crime Agency said it arrested 19 suspected site users, including two men aged 34 and 36, who are being held on suspicion of fraud and computer misuse. A senior FBI official told TechCrunch that arrests have also been made in the United States, but exact numbers were not confirmed. “This is the biggest operation of its kind. We’re not just going after administrators or taking sites down; we’re going after users on a global scale,” the official said. They added that by obtaining Genesis Market’s computer systems, officials have identified approximately 59,000 users of the marketplace. The FBI also provided data breach notification website Have I Been Pwned with “millions” of email addresses and passwords from the Genesis Market, which internet users can check to see if they were compromised. Genesis Market has been active since 2017 as an invitation-only online marketplace that sells stolen credentials, cookies and digital browser fingerprints gathered from compromised systems. These fingerprints, or “bots,” included IP addresses, session cookies, plugins and operating system details, enabling attackers to impersonate victims’ browsers to access their online banking and subscription services, such as Amazon and Netflix, without needing the victim’s password or two-factor token. Before its shutdown, Genesis claimed that these browser fingerprints would be kept up to date for as long as it retained access to a compromised device. “In other words, Genesis customers aren’t making a one-time buy of stolen information of unknown vintage; they’re paying for a de facto subscription to the victim’s information, even if that information changes,” Yusuf Arslan Polat, senior threat researcher at Sophos, said in an analysis of Genesis Market last year. Even up to its seizure, the number of infected devices for sale on the marketplace was growing in size. “In 2021, over 20,000 new bots a month were being added to the site,” said Cyril Noel-Tagoe, principal researcher at cybersecurity and bot management company Netacea. “The market was temporarily down in the middle of 2022, however despite this, by March 2023, the number of bots available for sale had grown to over 450,000.” The FBI said that Genesis Market, since its inception, offered access to data stolen from more than 1.5 million compromised computers worldwide containing over 80 million account access credentials. While overall financial losses have not yet been determined, the FBI says Genesis has made at least $8.7 million from the sale of stolen credentials, but noted that complete total losses likely exceed tens of millions of dollars. According to reports, the now-defunct marketplace has been linked to millions of financially motivated cyber incidents globally. In June 2021, the hackers who breached gaming giant Electronic Arts claimed to gain access to the gaming giant by purchasing a $10 bot from Genesis Market that let them log into a company Slack account. “As a result of the Genesis Market’s seizure, we expect to see an exodus of sellers and customers to competitor marketplaces,” Noel-Tagoe tells TechCrunch. “There are multiple other illicit marketplaces selling logs and credentials, although not on the scale of the Genesis Market. Alternatively, if a significant core of the Genesis Market administrators evade law enforcement, they may splinter off and create a new version of the site.” The takedown of Genesis Market comes just weeks after the FBI gained access to the infamous BreachForums hacking forum and arrested a 20-year-old New York man accused of running the site. It also comes after U.S. law enforcement last year announced the takedown of SSNDOB, a notorious marketplace used for trading the personal information — including Social Security numbers — of millions of Americans. Updated with additional information from the FBI."
161,Threading the needle: 5 questions with investor Lauren Maillian,['@dominicmadori'],"April 11, 2023","For the past five years, Lauren Maillian was tasked with asking hard questions. Questions like: How much venture funding goes to Black women and Latina founders? She was first chair of the board and then later CEO of the nonprofit Digitalundivided, where she oversaw the organization’s biennial reports known as ProjectDiane, which tracked the progress of underrepresented women founders in the startup ecosystem. She led teams that examined biases in decision-making, studied economic inequality and the manifold ways in which sociology interacts with venture capital. Having such data has been monumental, as it provided hard facts to show the discrimination that such founders face. In her role, she struck partnerships with JPMorgan, AMEX, AWS and the Nasdaq Foundation while quadrupling the nonprofit’s revenue, finding ways to make more money to conduct more research. “We were able to leverage the power of data and drive change and advocacy in a unique way,” she told TechCrunch+, adding that she believes Black women and Latina founders are the future of innovation and technology. “I’ve been the Black woman founder; I’ve been underestimated. I’ve been second-guessed. I’ve been to all those places. I know what it’s like to be doubted, and I know what it’s like to feel as though you really need a third-party data point to point to that’s not just yourself.” Before Digitalundivided, Maillian was a founder and one of the first Black women to start an early-stage venture firm. As an angel investor today, she has backed Partake Foods, the online community Diem and the rug company Ruggable. For nearly two decades, her career has been intertwined with culture and innovation. She says she was into investing before it was a “buzzword.” “I’ve always loved to study and invest in brands,” she says. “I’ve looked up and amassed a $5 billion market cap with my personal investment portfolio.” This January, Maillian stepped down from her work at Digitalundivided and decided to invest in herself. She says she has never taken a break in her long career, not even as she dealt with being a single mother. But even in the midst of this breather, Maillian is mapping out what’s next. I caught up with Maillian recently to talk about power in the industry, the changing landscape for Black women and Latinas, and what her next act will be. (This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.) TC: After five total years at Digitalundivided and 20 years in the industry, when did you know it was time to finally move on and start your own thing? Lauren Maillian: I was working 70-plus hours a week and I knew that I needed to take a step back. I accomplished more than I ever thought I would in this role. I didn’t know exactly what I was coming into and I wanted to see if my approach to social impact, social change, investing, economic development and narrative change was possible. Looking back, I think I exceeded my expectations and I’m proud of what I see in the ecosystem happening for all the founders I served while I was there. But I also know that there are so many other ways for me to continue serving and collaborating with the ecosystem."
162,iOS 17 will reportedly set the stage for sideloading apps on iPhone,['@indianidle'],"April 17, 2023","Apple has kept the iPhone app distribution system closed, allowing users to download the apps only from the App Store. But the company might be adding some gates to this walled garden to let people sideload apps on iPhones soon. A Bloomberg report noted that the Cupertino-based company will build the groundwork for such functionality with iOS 17. Reporter Mark Gurman said in his newsletter that Apple is overhauling its software for sideloading and we might see some announcement related to that at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. Last year, another Bloomberg report hinted at Apple’s new approach toward sideloading, owing to a change in regulation in Europe. EU’s Digital Market Act (DMA) will come into effect in 2024. The act forces big tech companies to allow alternative app stores on their platforms, so developers have a choice when it comes to app distribution and users have the choice of downloading apps from different sources.   It’s unclear if Apple is planning to allow sideloading with iOS 17 or if Apple is just making some changes at the operating system level to enable this possibility at some point down the road. The company didn’t immediately comment on the story. Historically, Apple execs including Tim Cook and Craig Federighi have staunchly opposed sideloading citing privacy and security reasons. Bloomberg’s latest report noted that Apple will also announce updates to iOS, macOS, and tvOS. While these operating systems will have some incremental updates, watchOS might get a big design overhaul. Naturally, all eyes will be on Apple’s rumored unveiling of its first XR headset, which will focus on developers at launch. Along with this, the company is also expected to release a new operating system and a software development kit that will provide developers with the building blocks for making apps for this headset."

Semafor was the first to notice and report the move to Dublin earlier this week. PDD Holdings, the Dublin-based corporate entity behind Temu, also owns Pinduoduo, which has become one of China’s largest online marketplaces since its launch in 2015 by ex-Google engineer Colin Huang. From the sound of it, PDD Holdings was created to separate the branding and some of the operational efforts between globally-facing Temu and China-focused Pinduoduo. Prior to Temu’s commencement in 2022, the “principal executive offices” that run Pinduoduo were Shanghai-based Pinduoduo Inc. Pinduoduo is still based out of Shanghai while Temu is headquartered in Boston. Temu’s teams in Boston and Dublin mostly perform functions in tax, marketing and legal matters, according to its employees’ LinkedIn profiles. In its annual report published in late April, the Dublin entity was listed as the “principal executive offices” of PDD Holdings. The filing didn’t break down Temu’s earnings as the platform didn’t have a “material impact” on the parent’s financial results in 2022 despite its strong momentum in the first few months of its debut. At the time of writing, Temu is ranked No.1 in the App Store’s overall category in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S., according to data analytics firm Data.ai.    "

The new figures arrives by way of Counterpoint Research, marking a stark contrast to ongoing declines in smartphone shipments. The market research firm said Monday that the global secondary smartphone market grew 5% YoY in 2022. The growth would have been more if China’s refurbished smartphone sales did not see a 17% decline, mainly due to the resurgence of COVID-19 and the arrival of COVID-Zero policies, the firm said. Nonetheless, the decline in China’s secondary smartphone sales has helped India take the top spot, with a 19% YoY growth, followed by Latin America with an 18% YoY growth. Apple captured over 49% of the secondary market in 2022, becoming the fastest-growing brand in the used and refurbished sectors globally. The market share of the Cupertino company grew from 44% in 2021, according to the research firm. High demand for refurbished smartphones is affecting the sales of new iPhones and Apple’s service revenues in many markets. However, Apple has succeeded in cracking its growth in the refurbished market and is attracting people to buy refurbished iPhone models even in places where their new variants are hard to find, Counterpoint said. Apple has long been selling refurbished iPhone models through its official channels and offers a full one-year warranty on their battery and outer shell to make them appealing to customers. The iPhone maker also has various sustainability-focused initiatives and delivers regular software updates even on older models, making it easier for consumers to go with refurbished models over their new versions. Growth specifically seen in countries including India was also due to Apple’s success in the refurbished market. “Apple is a highly aspirational brand in India, and refurbished iPhones give further a lower entry point to these aspirational users in Apple’s ecosystem,” Tarun Pathak, research director, Counterpoint, told TechCrunch. He added that the South Asian nation was still small, about 15% of the global refurbished smartphone market. Unlike Apple, Samsung saw a dip in the secondary market from 28% in 2021 to 26% in 2022, per Counterpoint. A small percentage of Android consumers shifted to iOS in the year, affecting Samsung’s refurbished sales. The trend would continue in 2023, the research firm said. Image Credits: Counterpoint Research With the increasing demand for 5G handsets in the global markets, 5G made up 13% of global refurbished smartphone sales in 2022. “The business potential of dealing in refurbished smartphones remains high, but the limited supply is affecting most emerging markets like LATAM, Southeast Asia, India and Africa,” Counterpoint senior analyst Glen Cardoza said in a prepared statement. “Imports from mature markets like the US, Europe and Japan have reduced as they have to cater to their own demand.” Counterpoint noted a large share of consumers preferred buying premium and flagship smartphones in the refurbished market in 2022, resulting in a growth in the average selling prices of the secondary market. However, the significant growth in the pricing of new models — not just in the case of the iPhone but in general — appears to be pushing customers for refurbished smartphones to a large extent. Macroeconomic factors impacting businesses and jobs are also making the refurbished smartphone market a sweet spot for customers around the globe. The firm predicts the increased trade-ins and shift toward premium smartphones might help increase the inventory of low-grade used smartphones in 2023. End-of-life activities like disassembly, logistics, warehousing, recycling and e-waste disposal will also likely boost refurbished smartphone sales this year."
165,Shopify adds direct bill payments in bid to be a single-stop fintech for merchants,['@bayareawriter'],"April 24, 2023","Shopify has teamed up with Israeli B2B payments startup Melio to launch a new bill pay tool designed to allow U.S.-based merchant customers to manage their expenses and vendors via its platform.  It’s another step in Shopify’s plan to straddle the intersection of fintech and commerce, noted Shruti Patel, global head of merchant services partnerships and monetization at Shopify. The rationale behind the new feature plays to the notion that if merchants can spend less time on tedious tasks such as consolidating their invoices and paying bills, they can spend more time focusing on growing their businesses. It also was in part driven by merchants asking for money movement capabilities, Patel told TechCrunch in an interview. “We have been on the fintech journey since we introduced payments back in the day, powered by Stripe,” she said. “That gave us tons of insight on our payments data. And then we came out and offered Shopify Capital in 2016, which was designed to meet our merchants’ micro and macro lending needs. And then last year we introduced what we call Shopify Balance, which was almost like a money management tool.” Shopify intentionally worked to embed the bill pay feature into its existing product — and the same place its merchant customers run their businesses — because it wanted it to be a fully integrated accounts payable solution within the store administration. “If you look at how banks offer and financial institutions offer bill pay today, it’s a pretty redirect experience,” Patel said. “…But a lot of those experiences are pretty broken because they just link to a bank account and enable them to use them through that one method of payment.” By contrast, she said, Shopify merchants will have a choice of funding sources such as a bank account, Shopify Balance, credit or debit card or an ACH bank transfer. They can even pay with credit cards even if a vendor doesn’t accept them. “It’s not only the cost optionality on which payment method and how to choose that, but also the speed we are allowing them to schedule payments,” Patel added. Shopify, for example, can allow for payments to be made up to four days earlier than a traditional bank, she said. Merchants also have the option to pre-schedule payments. The bill pay feature is free for its merchants but there are “minimal fees” associated with certain payment methods such as a credit card, according to Patel.  “One of the reasons we wanted to do this for our merchants is going back to some of the feedback we heard which was how much bill pay is a pain point, especially for smaller merchants who cannot afford very expensive subscription plans,” she said. Internally, having the ability to offer bill pay will offer Shopify insights on how they’re spending and which vendors they’re spending with. “And today, banks have that insight, but they don’t really do anything with it, because they’re not running storefronts for the small businesses,” Patel said. “What we want to do is really have that data help us drive more revenue for our merchants.” Shopify declined to say how many merchants it has in the U.S., noting only that it works with “millions of merchants” overall.

166,"US, South Korea both seek Do Kwon’s extradition to face charges",['@kateparknews'],"March 24, 2023","Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, which operated the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token LUNA, was arrested in Montenegro on Thursday while trying to board a flight to flee to Dubai with falsified documents.  A few hours after Kwon was arrested at the airport in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, U.S. prosecutors charged Kwon with eight criminal indictments, including securities fraud and conspiracy, for his alleged role in the decline of TerraUSD and LUNA, which wiped out about $40 billion of value from the crypto market. Interpol also confirmed Kwon’s identity on Thursday, per CNN.  What’s next? We don’t know which country Kwon will be sent to, as he now faces criminal charges in the U.S as well as his native country, South Korea. Both countries appear to be seeking Kwon’s extradition. A spokesperson for South Korean prosecutors told TechCrunch that they are discussing with “related parties” about extraditing Kwon to the country as soon as possible. The spokesperson did not specify which country Kwon would be moved to from Montenegro, how long it is likely to take, or the identity of the related parties. Kwon has been under investigation for the past 11 months since the Terra/LUNA collapse, which wiped out about $40 billion from the cryptocurrency market. In mid-September, Kwon tweeted, “I am not ‘on the run’ or anything similar – for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate, we are in full cooperation and we don’t have anything to hide.” “We are in the process of defending ourselves in multiple jurisdictions – we have held ourselves to an extremely high bar of integrity, and look forward to clarifying the truth over the next few months,” he said at the time. In late September, his whereabouts were unknown and Interpol issued a red notice requesting law enforcement agencies worldwide search for and arrest him. Shortly after, the South Korean government ordered Kwon to surrender his passport or risk it getting revoked. Do Kwon said last October that charges leveled against him by the South Korean prosecutors are not legitimate and are politically motivated. Fast-forward to February, prosecutors in South Korea traveled to Serbia, suspecting that was where Kwon was staying. In mid-February, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Terraform Labs and Kwon with defrauding U.S. investors who purchased its crypto assets, LUNA and the not-so-stable stablecoin, Terra.

167,"This Week in Apps: Newsrooms leave Twitter, Reels expands, Android 14 arrives",['@sarahintampa'],"April 15, 2023","Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app economy in 2023 hit a few snags, as consumer spending last year dropped for the first time by 2% to $167 billion, according to data.ai’s “State of Mobile” report. However, downloads are continuing to grow, up 11% year-over-year in 2022 to reach 255 billion. Consumers are also spending more time in mobile apps than ever before. On Android devices alone, hours spent in 2022 grew 9%, reaching 4.1 trillion. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more. Do you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here: techcrunch.com/newsletters Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch This week was one of the more interesting ones for Twitter since Elon Musk’s takeover, as multiple newsrooms finally had enough of Elon Musk’s antics. After Musk labeled NPR and others as “state-affiliated media” — a label previously reserved for state propaganda accounts, like the Kremlin-backed Russia Today and China’s Xinhua — NPR and PBS have stopped tweeting. After backlash to NPR’s new label, Twitter shifted to a newly made-up designation, “government-funded media.” In addition to NPR, the news organizations PBS and the BBC received the new labels as well. The BBC objected, too, and Twitter changed its label to “publicly funded” instead. (PBS and NPR remain labeled as “government-funded” as of the time of writing.) Musk’s capricious decision to lump independent news organizations alongside state-supported propaganda accounts is both misleading and dangerous. NPR, for instance, receives “less than 1 percent of its $300 million annual budget from the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting.” PBS receives more of its funding from the public and philanthropic organizations than it does from the small amount it gets from government subsidies. More importantly — unlike in state regimes where government officials heavily influence the spread of information to the people — NPR and PBS are editorially independent. Whether you like the nature of their reporting is, of course, a subjective matter. But an objective analysis puts the two in the middle of the Ad Fontes media bias chart.   Musk, however, wanted to sully their brands by suggesting the U.S. government has influence over their reporting. That’s what labeling them “state media” or “government-funded” does, and he certainly knows it. The Twitter owner delights in dragging down the media, having already done so on numerous occasions. He has tweeted conspiracies and called The NYT’s news “fake.” He banned reporters who commented on his own ban of a bot that tracked his private jet. He has shown so little regard for the media that he set Twitter’s press email to respond to inquiries with a poop emoji. What he gets from these sorts of antics is unclear, because it’s not good for the business he runs. The erratic billionaire seems more interested in performing stunts for his fans — followers who cheer on dumb things like this — than ensuring Twitter’s own brand can stay afloat.   But so far, the real-world fallout has been minimal. Not this week. To actually target media like this — by marring their brands on Twitter’s platform — was the last straw for some. In addition to NPR and PBS, other news organizations have also now abandoned ship, including Boston NPR affiliate WBUR, Hawaii Public Radio and LA-based local news source LAist. You can be sure many others are reconsidering the extent of their investments. What Musk may not understand is that, despite journalists’ own addictions to the app, Twitter actually sends very little traffic to news sites. And what it does send is declining. Largely, media organizations get inbound views from much bigger platforms, like Facebook, Google Search and Google News. They can, in fact, live without Twitter. And now they will. What’s more, if more newsrooms are to follow suit, Twitter’s reputation will be harmed. The app, after all, is not listed in the Social Networking category on the App Store, but in “News.” The network, if anything, is known as the first place news lands, not only from traditional media organizations but from on-the-ground, live tweets by regular people witnessing news events, too. But if the news leaves Twitter, what will Twitter become? At the same time, Twitter alternatives are siphoning off portions of the user base, including those interested in discussions around news and other topical events. This week, for instance, Twitter and Substack got into it over Substack’s launch of Notes, its new Twitter-like discussions feature for newsletter authors and their readers. In response, Twitter throttled Substack links, put up warnings and prevented users from liking, replying or retweeting posts with Substack links. Musk also accused Substack of trying to download a massive portion of its user base to bootstrap Substack Notes.   In an exceedingly awkward interview with The Verge, where Substack CEO Chris Best should have been able to take a victory lap as a viable Twitter threat, he instead fully dropped the ball. The exec dodged questions over content moderation, making it clear to anyone following that Substack would permit all kinds of speech — potentially losing the company new subscribers who would have otherwise considered joining. For example, when pressed about whether or not racist speech would be allowed on Substack, Best would not respond with an affirmative “no.” Instead, he replied, “We have content policies that are deliberately tuned to allow lots of things that we disagree with, that we strongly disagree with.” When pressed further, he wouldn’t even respond to a question as to whether or not it would allow “overt racism” on the platform. “I’m not going to engage in speculation,” he said. Wow, just wow. And yet, Best’s obvious signaling here could appeal to a certain toxic-leaning crowd that still hangs out on Twitter. It’s clear at least that Elon Musk must view Substack as a threat to Twitter’s business because of its appeal to self-identified free speech enthusiasts who now rally around Musk himself. Substack isn’t alone in targeting Twitter’s users with a new discussion platform at this time. Though arguably aiming for a different demographic, the news aggregator app Artifact from Instagram’s founders this week rolled out commenting. Like Substack Notes, the feature could appeal to those who want to engage in discussions around the news, though perhaps those of a more civil nature. Artifact promises it will engage in moderation, bans if needed, and it curates its news sources upfront. And with the app’s newly Reddit-like comment upvoting features and user reputation scores, it’s incentivizing people to spend their time building up a name for themselves on its platform, instead of over on Twitter.   Then there are the many, many Twitter alternatives to contend with, including Mastodon (and its app ecosystem), Bluesky, T2, Post and others still to emerge. While most are being built as Twitter clones, Post’s idea is to create a feed that caters to news publishers by allowing for micropayments that let users read otherwise paywalled articles. The idea is interesting but, like all newcomers, the question is one of scale. Still, as newsrooms scramble for Twitter’s exit doors, Post’s platform could look more appealing. And if the news orgs come, the people may follow.   Even if these alternatives only pull a few thousand users away from Twitter at first, those numbers could grow over time as each individual network grows. It’s too soon to say if any will pull ahead as the default “new Twitter,”  but they could deliver death by a thousand cuts, so to speak. That begs the question as to if or when Twitter itself will ever actually die. And the answer is that it may not for quite some time. Myspace still lived long after Facebook took over. (In fact, you can still sign up.) Google Plus became a barren wasteland long before Google pulled the plug. (It was even hacked and no one cared!) BlackBerry phones were sold well into the iPhone era. (Kim Kardashian still carried one for years.) In other words, we won’t just wake up one day to find Twitter has suddenly gone offline. It will slowly become less relevant, barring major changes to get it back on track, and when it dies we may not even notice. Already, Twitter is morphing into something new. Today’s Twitter is nothing like its predecessor. Across every front, the app is being made over, often for the worse. Musk revamped Twitter Blue with the goal of democratizing verification, only to create a system where something that was once a feature that made Twitter better, was now a curse. Verification previously served the purpose of confirming people were who they claimed. Now, it’s open to anyone, including bad actors, who want to masquerade as others or cause trouble. What’s more, Twitter says it plans to make the main For You (algorithmic) timeline only available to those who pay — a move that would make Twitter far less useful. Musk also cut off API access to app developers, then updated its API pricing to make building simple Twitter tools, like helpful bots, out of reach. Apps and bots have since shut down.   He also reinstated controversial accounts, like those of white supremacists, and now generally uses Twitter to create chaos, leading to continual confusion among users as to what the state of the network is on any given day. Twitter currently keeps itself in the news by being in a constant state of flux.  Over the past several days, for instance, Twitter announced it would reduce Twitter Blue subscribers’ ad load; saw Twitter Circle bugs that allowed others to see private tweets; got sued by its ex-CEO and other execs over unpaid legal bills; announced a new date (4/20 ofc) to remove legacy checkmarks; rebranded Super Follows to Subscriptions, promising creators it won’t keep any of their money at first; partnered with the investment platform eToro to show real-time information about stocks and crypto prices; and added support for 10,000-character-long tweets.   All this activity masks what’s actually going on: Twitter’s slower, quieter demise. Musk can claim all he likes that the company is now breaking even. The fact is, it’s been losing money compared to where it was before. Over the past two months,the top 50 Twitter advertisers spent $83 million, down from $102 million year-over-year, and major brands including Mars, AT&T, VW and Stellantis haven’t returned. Traffic to Twitter’s ad portal was down 18.7% year-over-year, indicating declining interest from marketers. The percentage of Americans who reported using Twitter dropped from 32.4% to 29.5% from pre-Elon to post-Elon, one survey said. Advertisers aren’t just on pause. They’ve also seemingly lost trust in Twitter, as Quartz reported this week with the damning headline “Elon Musk is personally ruining Twitter’s ad business.” The article notes the company is expected to bring in 28% less revenue this year than in 2022, or $2.98 billion down from $4.14 billion. Despite everything, Twitter has perservered, and will likely take some time before it reaches its inevitable end. Widespread company-wide layoffs and Twitter’s refusal to pay its bills or its rent have helped it stay afloat in the near term. But the company can’t run on Musk’s hopes and dreams about becoming a super app called “X” forever. Twitter will require funds to stay alive. And if cash isn’t flowing in from advertisers, then perhaps Musk will dig into his own pockets or those of its Saudi investors to keep the tweet engine going for a bit longer. In other words, don’t hold your breath awaiting Twitter’s coming demise. But feel free to withhold your attention.

168,"For your pitch, last impressions count almost as much as first impressions",['@Haje'],"April 23, 2023","Your first slide is obviously important for a pitch deck. First impressions count and having a solid introduction goes a long way. It seems that founders often forget that the last slide is just as important. There’s a simple reason for that: Investors easily look at hundreds of slide decks per month, and it’s hard to remember them all. Sure, startup names are often catchy and pretty self-explanatory (Lyft, DoorDash), but it’s hard remember that Orange refers to a car-charging company not the fruit. Companies often give shorthand summaries of the businesses they’re working with. In the case of Orange, it might be, “You know, the company that puts chargers in apartment buildings.” Everyone around the table goes, “Aaaah, yes,” and the conversation continues. As a founder, you have an opportunity to influence how someone summarizes your company. The way to do that is by reinforcing your message on the first and last slides. What is a good shorthand for your company? Are you Dollar Shave Club for underwear? Are you Turo for caravans? Are you Freshbooks for plane ownership? Well, those are all helpful shorthand — but you can get more creative, too! When pitching, you start with your best stuff first and go from there. The last slides are generally where you show weaknesses. If you don’t have a closing slide, your greatest weaknesses might be left up on the screen while you talk with investors and answer questions. As you can see, that’s not a great way to prime the pump, and you’ll end up getting grilled on your financials, team, go-to-market or whatever you added to the end of the deck as an afterthought. Instead, set yourself up for success with a good closing slide. Remind your audience who you are and what your company will do. In this story, we are diving into the 45+ pitch deck teardowns done so far, and pickimg apart some of the closing slides from our library of pitch deck examples.

169,"RTRO launches an algorithm-free social app for friends, creators and brands",['@sarahintampa'],"May 1, 2023","Ahead of Meta’s launch of a text-based social network, female-founded social networking startup RTRO is launching its app this week with the goal of connecting brands, creators and their fans and followers in a more positive environment focused on human connections and communities, not algorithm-driven content. To accomplish this, RTRO divides its social experience into two parts — on one side, you can keep up with friends or family in RTRO’s “circles.” On the other side, users can switch over to see content from creators and brands in their own space. In addition, RTRO claims to offer robust content moderation features that focus on keeping the app free from bullying and toxicity and the ability to interact with ChatGPT. Founded by two tech and marketing veterans, the startup’s approach to social is one that aims to take users back to a simpler time when social networks were focused more on sharing real content and making connections with other people. This nostalgia for earlier days is reflected in the app’s name, “RTRO,” a misspelling of “retro.” After polling Gen Z and millennial users, the team found that people’s top complaints about today’s social media apps were about the number of brand ads showing up in users’ feeds and the algorithm-driven experience. But people also said they wanted to use social media to stay connected with others they care about and to view entertaining content. Brands, too, had shared their own complaints about modern social media, RTRO’s founders explained. Image Credits: RTRO Image Credits: RTRO With a background in experiential marketing, co-founders Nicole Falco and Tristan Brennan had worked with hundreds of Fortune 500 and 1000 brands over the years, including at Brennan’s marketing agency TH Experiential. This work included the creation of several digital products, apps and websites for brands to engage with customers globally. But the brands would often express to them their confusion and frustration around integrating social into their campaigns. “TikTok is still a little bit of a mystery for them, and then on [Instagram], ever-changing rules and ever-changing features and algorithms just make it a challenge for brands to figure out how to get in front of who they need to,” said Falco. These complaints from both users and brands got the founders thinking about how they can create something better. “We were looking at social media through the lens of the human experience, and how can we make it a little better, and also through the lens of technology, what technology can be leveraged?” Image Credits: RTRO Image Credits: RTRO The end result is RTRO, a social app where you can toggle between your personal connections and brand and creator content, as they each have their own spaces. On the personal side, there aren’t any brands interrupting the experience — however, they do have a way to stay involved. RTRO prompts users a few times a week to post — encouraging posts of affirmations, GIFs or updates about what you’re doing in real life (hashtagged as #LogOntoLife). Brands can sponsor these prompts, if they choose. Meanwhile, the other side of the app — aka RTRO TV — is an algorithm-free space where brands and creators intersect with their audience in a chat-style environment. At launch, RTRO has around 50 TikTok and Instagram creators making content for the app. Users can react to their posts, like giving it a thumbs up, but not message or comment. To engage with RTRO TV, users browse through various “channels” dedicated to topics like travel, food, beauty and more. This puts users more in control of what sort of content they see in their feeds, the company says. “You can go to that channel and you can explore brand and creator content — so you’re in full control of seeing what you want to see. This is completely new. This type of experience does not currently exist in an app,” Falco touts. However, the offering is similar in some ways to TikTok’s test of dedicated, topical feeds. In addition, creators can choose to create a private circle and post to it within their channel space. When finished, they can turn the circle off. Creators can also block users from messaging in the circle or remove them if they’re being hateful or toxic. Creators RTRO has tested with said they liked the ability to have more personal and casual conversations with followers. “In these channels, people with several hundred thousand followers are finding they can post one post to Instagram a day — it has a very tailored image,” says Brennan. But in the channels, they can now post many times a day, he explains. “They can have an informal conversation. It doesn’t have to feel so official [or like] their one moment to stand out. It creates something that’s a bit more personal,” he continues. “We’re finding the same thing with brands, too. They’re not just posting something to promote their products. They’re talking about their internal teams or culture, what they’re doing today…there’s something unique about having something that feels a little less official.” Brands testing RTRO include Alastin Skincare, KISS Nails, Loops Beauty, Halo 42, JOAH and others. Image Credits: RTRO Image Credits: RTRO Another feature allows users to interact with ChatGPT through an integration that lets them ask the AI for ideas and inspiration — something that could be another test case for how consumers might respond to AI in a social networking setting. So far, that’s been a bust for Snapchat — where its users recently panned the app’s introduction of the My AI feature, dubbing it “creepy” and asking for its removal. Other apps have seen better luck merging AI and social. Ghost’s mobile messaging app that allows friends to post anonymously in group chat just rolled out an iMessage extension and added functionality that lets users create mini-apps using ChatGPT. The app then moved into the No. 5 spot in the Social Category on Apple’s iMessage App Store. To get RTRO’s app off the ground, the team worked with an outsourced firm, but its in-house CTO has previously created a number of consumer digital experience and mobile apps for larger companies like Microsoft, Amazon, iHeartMedia, CLEAR, WeWork and Grailed. The startup aims to bring the outsourced team in-house as well at some point in the future, and says those talks are already underway. The company has not yet shared its revenue model plans, but aims to release that part of its strategy in the next quarter or so. RTRO, a remotely distributed team of under a dozen, is currently backed by angel funding only, including investment from both co-founders. No pre-seed or seed funding has yet been raised. RTRO is a free download on the App Store."
170,How technology unlocks business models: The story of Netflix,['@Haje'],"April 22, 2023","  “Usually the best way to figure out if your crazy idea is any good is simply to try it. So that’s what we did,” Marc Randolph, Netflix’s co-founder and original CEO, That crazy idea was to send a CD through the mail to learn whether the concept of a mail-order DVD subscription service was practical. The CD, sent by USPS in a greeting card envelope, arrived safely the next day. The proof of operating concept for Netflix was confirmed. This week, 16 years after its reinvention as a streaming company, Netflix announced that it’s shuttering its mail-order DVDs business. But how did it go from sending that one CD to becoming the juggernaut that it is today? Let’s take a look. “All I knew was that I wanted to start my own company and sell things on the internet. That was it,” Randolph wrote on Twitter. Reed Hastings met Marc Randolph when they ended up working together at Pure Software after an acquisition. That resulted in them sharing an office and a car ride to and from work each day. Ready for a new challenge, Hastings and Randolph began to bounce ideas for new companies off of each other. DVDs had barely been invented yet. In fact, when the Netflix founders went looking for one to try shipping it in the mail, they couldn’t find anywhere to buy one. The ideas were many and varied and included personalized shampoo (!), personalized dog food (!!) and selling vitamins online. All of these products now exist, but at the time the duo dismissed them as not being feasible. Another idea that wasn’t feasible was taking on Blockbuster by shipping VHS tapes, which were too big and bulky to be shipped via regular mail, and FedEx was going to eat into the profit margins something awful. Then something happened: Digital versatile discs, or DVDs, came along. They were much smaller and thinner than their VHS counterparts, and this technology innovation unlocked a new form of video rentals. Incidentally, once the internet became fast and ubiquitous enough, streaming would become possible, too, giving birth to the Netflix we know today, but I’m getting slightly ahead of myself. "

Companies are scrambling to either incorporate AI into their existing business model or change up their marketing so whatever they were already quietly using AI to do is front and center. Y Combinator’s latest class is no different. Angel investor Gokul Rajaram tweeted recently that he had heard from a company in the latest YC cohort that half of the class was looking to use chatGPT. Now, with a letter circulating that asks AI researchers to pause development and with YC demo day next week, we decided to see if that checks out. Turns out, it’s not that far off. Ninety-one startups, or 34%, of the current YC class list that they are an AI company or use AI in some kind of way, according to the accelerator’s handy online database. If you narrow that down to generative AI you get 54, or 20%. While not quite half, it’s still striking when compared to past cohorts. In previous years, the highest number of companies using generative AI in a single YC class was nine, and a count of more general AI usage brought the number to 44; both numbers hail from classes much larger than the current one, too. This isn’t particularly surprising. "
172,"Microsoft launches Pegasus program for startups, awarding up to $350,000 in credits",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"May 3, 2023","Microsoft is extending the Startup Founders Hub, its self-service platform that provides founders with free resources including Azure credits, with a new incubator program called the Pegasus Program. Pegasus will select startups with products that “fill a market need” and give them up to $350,000 in Azure, GitHub and LinkedIn credits plus backing from advisors, as well as “access to the best Microsoft tech,” according to Hans Yang, general manager at Microsoft for Startups. “Given the current economic climate, today’s launch of Microsoft for Startups Pegasus Program couldn’t be timelier,” Yang, speaking to TechCrunch via email, said. “In a capital-constrained environment, startups need to demonstrate traction and revenue growth. Startups selling to enterprise companies are challenged with long sales cycles, complex regulatory requirements, and high demands for scalability and reliability. At the same time, enterprise companies know that disruption is coming, but want to work with startups who can meet their rigorous requirements.” Pegasus is a two-year program, open to startups already active in Microsoft’s Founders Hub and with customer-facing products built on the Microsoft Cloud. A core requirement is having early product-market fit, Yang stressed, including revenue traction, a sales team in place and a “proven” go-to-market model. “This signals to us that they are ready to go up market to enterprise customers,” Yang added. “Our industry-focused experts, when evaluating potential Pegasus startups, also ensure their solutions are resolving current industry challenges for these sectors. This ensures we provide enterprises with relevant solutions that they can invest in to get a short-term return on investment.” All startups chosen for Pegasus are assigned a vertical lead to generate sales opportunities and act as an advisor. They also get a success manager, who’s responsible for helping them go to market and “ensure they have the best resources for generating and developing deals.” Lastly, Pegasus companies receive a dedicated cloud solution architect to support their technical success and facilitate “preferred” access to Azure’s AI offerings. These architects serve as a single point of contact within Pegasus, helping startups engage with Microsoft customers and handling compliance and security checks. Yang noted that, while Pegasus inherently favors startups built with Azure tech, the program doesn’t lock companies or partners into a particular cloud. They’re able to use multiple clouds, including stalwarts such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, if they so choose, as long as they’re meeting their customers’ needs. “The program is really driven by the needs of enterprise customers, and while many of our customers enjoy the synergies of leveraging multiple Microsoft solutions together, we are focused on their needs,” Yang said.

Image Credits: Microsoft There’s no limit to the number of startups that can join Pegasus, but Yang says that special attention will be paid to those in industries like healthcare, AI, retail and cybersecurity. He expressed outsize enthusiasm for generative AI, a particularly hot market at the moment. “As the AI era takes shape, enterprise companies are looking for ways to embrace generative AI, which presents a tremendous opportunity for startups who can help them on that journey,” Yang said. “Broadly, we believe that every startup, regardless of the industry they serve, should be exploring how they incorporate generative AI into their product roadmap.” In private preview, Microsoft claims that Pegasus has already supported more than 100 startups whose average deal size exceeded $300,000. In total, it’s pledged over $35 million to those startups in tech credits. “We’ve been piloting the Pegasus program to refine the matchmaking process, working with business-to-business startups on a daily basis … to identify enterprise customers with a specific need for innovative solutions and connect them with the startups that can address that need,” Yang said. “We help get their products and go-to-market plans enterprise-ready, then take them to market alongside our sales team and directly to enterprise buyers. The results have been promising, with Pegasus startups seeing an average deal size of $350,000 and an active pipeline of over 1,300 opportunities.” Pegasus complements Microsoft’s various ongoing early-and late-stage startup efforts, including partnerships with VCs and accelerators to back 10,000 companies in Africa over the next five years. The tech giant also maintains the ISV Success Program, a program designed to help early-stage software vendors build and publish apps."
173,T-Mobile to provide free MLB.TV subscriptions to customers through 2028,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 6, 2023","T-Mobile announced today that it has extended its partnership with Major League Baseball to allow its customers to continue receiving free MLB.TV subscriptions through 2028. An MLB.TV subscription typically costs $150 per year. The extended partnership comes as T-Mobile has offered MLB.TV as a free perk for its customers for the past eight years. MLB.TV lets you stream out-of-market home and away games live or on demand. The service also gives subscribers access to pregame and postgame shows. T-Mobile notes that for the first time, MLB.TV now also provides fans with access to their favorite team’s affiliates’ games in the MLB app. Fans can catch games on their favorite supported devices and enjoy live game DVR controls to pause and rewind the action in HD. “T-Mobile and MLB are embarking on a six-year journey to deliver breakthrough fan experiences, and it’s all thanks to our leading 5G network,” said T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert in a press release. “We’re enhancing the game on and off the field to give fans across the country even more ways to enjoy the game we all love — on top of showing our customers love with free MLB.TV.” It’s worth noting that the deadline for this year’s free signup period for MLB.TV has already passed, unfortunately, as the last day to sign up was April 4. T-Mobile notes that more customers redeemed their free MLB.TV subscription this year than ever before. T-Mobile also announced that it will work with the MLB to test an automated ball-strike system (ABS) powered by the company’s private 5G network during some Minor League games. The carrier says real-time ABS data and video will be transmitted securely to help prevent signal interference via devices and the ABS application.  "
174,Ensemble raises $100M debut fund to bet on startup teams — but not in the way you think,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 4, 2023","Almost any venture capitalist will say that they back startups based on the strength of the founding team. But what about the rest of a startup’s employees? New VC shop Ensemble thinks you need to go beyond the founders to see if a team will actually make a startup successful. Collin West, a co-founder and managing partner at Ensemble, told TechCrunch that unlike other VCs, his new venture capital outlet determines if a startup is a good investment based on the depth of its entire team. The firm uses an in-house, data-driven algorithm to narrow down potential investments based on the entirety of a startup’s employees. The Texas-based firm has raised $100 million for its debut fund to try to prove this idea. West said that when Ensemble’s founding team — which also includes Conrad Shang, a former venture LP at UTIMCO, and Gopinath Sundaramurthy, previously a data scientist at IBM — was trying to nail down what it was about startups that made them stand out from others in the same sector, they all agreed that it was the companies that were able to attract the best talent. “Even if you do meet the company, you are only meeting the founder, and not the rest of the team,” West said. “A lot of the time, the founders are not the most interesting people on the team. Companies are buckets full of people — people who decide to work on a specific mission together.” Looking for startups that are good at recruiting isn’t exactly a novel approach, but West said that it’s pretty difficult to actually pull off: Choosing a sector and then going through each company’s entire team is laborious, largely a waste of time and essentially impossible to scale. To combat this, West said the Ensemble team built a data algorithm that tracks employees at a firm and helps narrow down companies with investment potential based on the depth of their team. The human members of the Ensemble team start diving in from there. West pointed out that this data-driven approach isn’t a silver bullet, though, which is why the team still conducts regular due diligence; Ensemble gets a smaller curated list as a jumping-off point. “Using software, we can track all of the people at all of the startups,” West said. “That ends up giving a whole lot more information than any human brain can handle, especially any venture firm. [We] effectively sort the industry by team quality in a very objective way, knowing what companies to focus on and spend a lot more time on a lot fewer companies.” Because the algorithm focuses on teams and not on metrics that may be more or less relevant to specific sectors, it allows Ensemble to be industry agnostic. West said one example of that would be the firm’s investment in 3D home printing startup ICON Technologies. “It’s an incredible company to work with, but it is a big mission, and changing the way home construction was done. To a lot of VCs, it was too big of a risk,” West said. “The beauty of using data is it helps you push your bias away and show up with curiosity.” The data doesn’t stop at due diligence, either. West said one of the firm’s value-adds for their portfolio companies is that after they invest, they launch a full report on a company’s team. The report is meant to find the bright spots, or areas of improvement, to give the startup the best idea of how to hire in a way that could directly affect growth. The firm’s focus on teams comes at an interesting time in the market as the industry grapples with both layoffs and a war for talent. While every firm is trying to track where the best laid-off professionals land, Ensemble’s data-driven approach may help it keep better tabs than traditional VCs. But that doesn’t guarantee a stronger portfolio. “We just want to be where the great teams are, full stop,” West said. “That is the beauty in having a data-driven team approach. Every company has a team.”"
175,MassMutual launches $100M fund to invest in diverse founders,['@dominicmadori'],"April 13, 2023","Insurance company MassMutual announced Thursday the launch of a new impact investing MM Catalyst Fund of $100 million. The money will be used to continue investing in Massachusetts-based diverse-led companies. It’s close to finishing the deployment of its first MM Catalyst Fund of $50 million, which launched two years ago and has so far invested in 16 businesses throughout the state. This second MM Catalyst fund will continue with the first fund’s mission of focusing on seed to Series B investments within Black-led startups as well as those from rural communities and other historically overlooked backgrounds. The fund will also selectively invest nationwide alongside fund managers at MassMutual’s First Fund Initiative, which focuses on investing in Black, Latino and Indigenous-led businesses across the U.S. and Canada. The latest MM Catalyst Fund and the First Fund Initiative bring MassMutual’s impact investment pledge for overlooked founders to $300 million, the institution told TechCrunch+. The efforts of MassMutual are a case study on how LPs and other investors can adjust themselves to better commit toward backing diverse funds and fund managers. Liz Roberts, the company’s head of impact investments, said that MassMutual looked at the facts: The Black, Indigenous and Latino communities make up more than a third of the U.S. population. Less than 5% of all VCs identify as Black or Latino, and, at the same time, less than 5% of all VC funds are allocated to Black and Latino founders. "
176,"In spite of recent downward trend, the future remains bright for cloud","['Ron Miller', 'Alex Wilhelm']","April 29, 2023","When it comes to cloud growth, it’s probably safe to say that the sky isn’t falling, even though revenue growth rates have been. We’ve seen the aggregate public cloud revenue growth decline from 32% in Q1 last year to 19% this year. That’s a pretty steep drop-off, and it shows that the cloud has run into some headwinds. As a result, we have seen folks talking about a great repatriation where cloud workloads will move back on-prem, but the evidence doesn’t suggest that’s happening. Instead, companies may be slowing cloud migration as they look at the most efficient way to distribute their workloads. Clearly, companies have learned that not every workload is well suited to the cloud. Some that can’t deal with even a little bit of latency to get to the cloud and back, for example, need to be hosted on the edge to be closer to the compute source. But it doesn’t look like many IT departments long to go back to the days of racking and stacking new servers. So why is public cloud growth slowing down? Customers have started to look at their hefty cloud bills, with budgets coming under ever more intensive review this year, looking for ways to cut costs, which Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky acknowledged in the company’s earnings call with analysts this week. “Enterprise customers continued their multidecade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work,” he said during the call. In CFO speak, that means that they aren’t abandoning the cloud, but they are taking a hard look at expenses, which is having a pretty significant impact on the company’s cloud growth numbers. He added that the slowing growth could continue for a couple more quarters, but that overall customers are still high on the cloud. “So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the midteens. That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.” By now, the value proposition of the cloud, regardless of the vendor, is clear. It allows a level of flexibility that just isn’t possible when you run your own data center, and running your own data center is expensive and requires an entirely different set of skills from running cloud workloads. So what does all this mean for the cloud infrastructure market revenue growth? If the data is right, it’s going to be fine. It just looks a little dicey in the short term."

178,"Warner Bros. Discovery promises Max will be a more personalized, technically improved streaming service",['@sarahintampa'],"April 12, 2023","With next month’s arrival of the new streaming service “Max” from Warner Bros. Discovery, the company is also promising a revamped product experience with an expanded feature set, improved recommendations and better performance. The new service, which combines HBO Max and Discovery+ content into one offering, will gain an updated user interface that’s delivered by way of a largely seamless transition for existing HBO Max subscribers across most platforms. However, Discovery+ subscribers will be able to continue to watch in their standalone app, if they choose, the company noted during today’s press event where it introduced the new service and its many forthcoming originals, including a new Game of Thrones series. Of particular interest, the company openly admitted that its current HBO Max service has a number of technical shortcomings that it now aims to address with the move to Max. “As we started this journey 12 months ago, we did a thorough assessment of our two streaming businesses, as well as the technology and products of each. And we realized that, while both were solid, they also each had important shortcomings,” said JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming and games, while speaking to the gathered crowd. “In summary, we needed to do the basics much better,” he said, before spinning his mea culpa into an odd form of praise by adding, “if we got this far with some suboptimal features and experiences, imagine what we will do when we get more of it right!” That’s certainly an interesting way to sell things, we’d say. Perrette said the new Max service would address several key business objectives, including user engagement, retention, more regular viewership and easier, more personalized discovery of the content offerings, to name a few.   Though the company had announced an expanded slate of new original programming earlier in the event, including new series like Big Bang Theory and True Detective spinoffs, a live-action Harry Potter, DC Comics titles like “The Penguin,” and others, the exec also acknowledged that the product itself has to do a better job at surfacing its content for subscribers. “HBO Max has an amazing depth of content, but it’s largely unexplored because we don’t make it easy enough to find,” he said. As an example of this problem, he noted that three-quarters of its viewership came from the home screen only, while on Discovery+ the majority of usage came from other screens deeper in the app. In addition, four times as much content drives the majority of viewership on Discovery+ than on HBO Max. Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery One might argue that’s because of the nature of the programming on the respective services, where Discovery+’s lifestyle content drives repeated viewing, perhaps, compared with flagship series like “Game of Thrones” that are viewed in real time, but are not necessarily the types of shows to be rediscovered later and then rewatched. However, the company is betting that product changes will be able to improve these metrics around discoverability. For starters, the revamped app will feature a new content navigation menu at the top that will help consumers more easily find the series and movies, as well as the new releases they may want to watch. Across the app, the company promises streamlined categories, improved content detail pages, shortcuts, dedicated brand hubs and thematic content rails, to make the app easier to explore. HBO’s brand will still have a prominent position in this new interface, too, but will be showcased alongside the company’s other top brands that will serve as gateways to their respective content. There will also be genre hubs to dive into different types of content and a new quick shortcut that lets users save content to a list for later viewing. For users on the new Ultimate Ad-Free tier, the service will feature an expanded catalog of 4K UHD content, including across programming like “Game of Thrones,” “The Last of Us,” “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings,” “The Dark Night” trilogy and others. This catalog will expand to include all the Warner Bros. movies released this year and in the future. Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Plus, individual user profiles will for the first time offer more personalized experiences where users are recommended new things to watch based on their prior habits and viewing, via things like “because you watched” recommendations, suggestions of what to watch next that appear when you finish a series or movie and immersive hero images tailored to the end user. This personalized experience will extend beyond the home page, too, so users are seeing tailored recommendations across the full service. A combination of machine learning and human editorial curation will help to drive these recommendations, Perrette explained. Parents will be able to configure their kids’ profiles, including through the use of parental controls. While that’s not new, the revamped Max will introduce a default kids profile for its new subscribers, with options for parents to set the profile to either little kids, big kids, big kids plus, pre-teens or teens — an expanded set of kids’ tiers that goes beyond those offered by some rival services, where the “kids” experience is often aimed at younger school-age children. This tends to frustrate older kids, and teens when they outgrow cartoons and other “kids” content, but aren’t yet old enough for more adult fare, like much of what HBO offers. Under the hood, the company touted other technological improvements focused on user retention, performance and stability. For example, Max will proactively alert customers about failed payments through notifications and on and off-product messages, including for the first time in-app alerts on connected TVs. It also added support for PayPal as another payment option and made it easier for its marketing teams to run promotional pricing without requiring weeks of engineering work. Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery The company additionally promised updates to its core architecture to deliver “faster, more reliable, and more efficient performance.” Among the changes, Max will offer a new connected TV sign-in process where users don’t have to type in their credentials with their remote and a more dependable downloads experience. “…We maniacally focused on app performance to get our customers watching their content as fast as possible,” Perrette said. “So app start times, video start times, and the general navigation response times will be 20 to 30% faster, depending on which device you’re using.” The exec said HBO Max app customers will be automatically updated to Max on May 23 when the shift is made. On most platforms, this update will happen automatically, but others will prompt users who open the HBO Max app to download the new Max app instead. It will then only be “two clicks” to continue watching, Perrette noted, as usernames, passwords, profiles, watch histories, watch rails and billing will carry over automatically. Discovery+ subscribers won’t be forced to transition apps but will be prompted at different times to try the new Max app. Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery Image Credits: Warner Bros. Discovery The new service will offer three pricing tiers, starting at $9.99 per month for ad-supported, $15.99 per month to go ad-free and $19.99 per month for ad-free viewing with 4K UHD and Dolby Atmos. The latter two tiers also include offline downloads but are limited to either 30 or 100 downloads, respectively. The top-tier service also includes four concurrent streams instead of just two.    "
179,Nestlé takes a big swig of Yfood in a deal that values the meal replacement startup at $469M,['@ingridlunden'],"April 6, 2023","Yfood, one of the direct-to-consumer food tech startups that has emerged over the last decade around the concept of meal replacement drinks, is bulking up. Nestlé, the food and drink behemoth, has acquired 49.95% of the company’s shares. The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed by the companies, but according to reliable sources close to the transaction, TechCrunch understands that Nestlé’s acquisition values Yfood at €430 million ($469 million), meaning the investment that Nestlé is making here is valued at €215 million. The investment acquisition will see all of Yfood’s venture backers — which include Felix Capital, dairy giant Fonterra, agri-startup VC Five Seasons and several others — sell their shares to Nestlé, according to documents reviewed by TechCrunch. Yfood’s co-founders and co-heads, Ben Kremer and Noël Bollmann, will continue to hold on to their 50.05% of shares and run the business independently. This is a substantial exit for investors of Munich-based Yfood, which was founded in Munich in 2017 and had only raised $22.6 million in outside backing (including $16 million in 2020). The deal — initially reported as in-progress at the beginning of March and formally closed today — will not include any new investment in Yfood, which is profitable and has been for a while. The startup currently sells ready-made drinks, powders to make your own drinks, and nutrition bars both directly to consumers online and via a network of retailers. Although it is typically classified as a meal-replacement business, its premise is not to replace all food. Before founding the startup, the two founders had been working in investment banking, and working late hours, and they lamented the few options they had when they got hungry and needed sustenance fast. “We had a problem we were solving for ourselves,” Bollmann told TechCrunch in the past. “All there was were candy machines and the choice was Snickers or crisps. We couldn’t understand why fast eating always had to be unhealthy. That was the inspiration.” It seems that they had tapped into a kind of zeitgeist with Yfood. The business is seeing revenue growth of 100% year-on-year, and last year it made €120 million ($131 million) in sales, according to a source. The focus for the company is Europe, and it claims to have sold at least 95 million “meals” — its meal replacement drinks, powders and bars, that is — to date in that region. Yfood’s milestone should give the food tech community something substantial to chew on. The intersection of tech and food has been playing out as a theme in the world of startups for years, with technologists and entrepreneurs bringing a hacking mentality to the field to take new approaches to sourcing, preparing, selling and distributing things to eat and drink. But not all of those recipes have turned out as planned. Remember Juicero? Or the various questions that hover over genetically modified (GMO) products? And that’s aside from the many efforts that have gone bad due to more general issues that can hit any startup, such as not getting the unit economics, market demand or culture right. At a time when funding can be hard to come by for startups, and many of them are seeing their valuations cool amid a wider tech sector downturn and macroeconomic pressures, M&A is going to be a well-travelled route for a number of these companies. The Yfood deal is an encouraging development on that front, not least because there have been some notable examples of M&A in the food tech space that have not played out that well for startups and their investors. Soylent — like Yfood, built around the concept of nutritionally complete meal replacement drinks — got a huge amount of buzz when it launched in 2013, opening up a meme-worthy conversation about whether or not Soylent and its ilk (or milk, as the case may be) heralded the end of food. The public lapped it up, but it seems that they didn’t really want to lap up Soylent itself. After picking up more than $70 million in funding from the crème de la crème of investors — names like Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Index Ventures and storied accelerator Y Combinator backed it — and reaching a valuation of $430 million in 2017 per PitchBook, when the company was eventually acquired in February 2023 by Starco Brands, it looks like the all-share transaction was valued at the time of the deal at $65 million. Update: Contacted about the deal, Yfood confirmed the investment details, would not discuss the valuation, and did not provide further comment. Separately, we removed a reference that lawyers working for YFoods and its co-founders said was inaccurate. Separately, we have updated the Starco deal price, too. "
180,Apple Music Classical is now available for download to everyone,"['Ivan Mehta', 'Sarah Perez']","March 28, 2023","Apple’s new app for classical music, Apple Music Classical, is now available as a free download for Apple Music subscribers. At launch, the service will be available globally, except in select markets, including China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Taiwan, and Turkey. However, Apple says it will arrive in these countries at some point in the future. The company said that there are more than 5 million tracks available on the app right now, as well over 50+ million data points with data attributes of 20,000+ composers, 115,000+ unique works, and 350,000+ movements. This data helps Apple Music subscribers find recordings across the catalog through the app’s specialized search engine built for classical music. As Apple explains, classical works have multiple movements and tracks, while famous pieces have hundreds of recordings with different orchestras, conductors, and soloists. In addition, many composers have their own special catalog classifications, which means classical music search has to be built differently with these complexities in mind. In the new app, users can search for works using keyword combinations that include composer, work, opus number, conductor, artist, instrument or even the work’s name. Plus, when you look up a work on the app, you’ll find all its associated recordings as well as a hand-picked “Editor’s Choice” performance. Apple Music Classical’s editors created over 700 playlists to guide listeners through 800 years of music, the company notes, and says more will be added over time. One initial collection, The Story of Classical audio guides, will combine commentary and selected works to introduce key composers, periods, instruments, and classical terminology for those just starting their discovery of this genre. For those already more knowledgeable, the app lets you go behind the scenes of selected recordings as classical artists offer track-by-track audio commentary, Apple notes. Another selection called “Hidden Gems” highlights a selection of lesser-known works, while “Composer Undiscovered” playlists aim to bring a new perspective to famous names. Many of the works on the app will come from classical institutions partnered with Apple to offer new and exclusive content and recordings, including the Berlin Philharmonic, Carnegie Hall, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, Opéra National de Paris, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, and the Vienna Philharmonic. To kick off the launch, Apple Music Classical will host live performances from partners from its Apple Store locations across the world, as part of the “Today at Apple” programming series beginning in March 2023. Meanwhile, on the discovery side, you can browse tracks using filters like composers, periods, genres, conductors, orchestras, ensembles, and choirs under the “Catalog” tab; different instruments through “Instruments” tab; and curated playlists under the “Playlists” tab. The service is based on Primephonic, an Amsterdam-based company Apple acquired in 2021 for an undisclosed sum. It also features exclusive albums, composer bios, and editorial deep dives on certain key works. Earlier this month, Apple announced the new classical streaming service was available for pre-order on the App Store with a March 28 release date.   You can add a track to the library or your own playlist, downloads aren’t supported.  However, you can add them to your library and download them via Apple Music. Apple has also made an interesting choice by not making shuffle available on the Classical app. All compositions are available to stream in audio quality up to 192kHz/24-bit Hi-Res Lossless. Also, a lot of tracks are available in immersive Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos support — if you have speakers or headphones that support this technology. At the moment, only AirPods Pro (1st or 2nd generation), AirPods Max, AirPods 3rd gen, or Beats Fit Pro support Spatial Audio. Apple notes the Spatial Audio catalog will add new albums every week as recordings are remastered and new performances are captured in Spatial Audio. While many of the compositions are focused on western classical music, TechCrunch was able to find some Hindustani classical and Carnatic titles, too, when testing the service at launch. The app also features high-res digital portraits of many of the world’s greatest composers. These commissioned artworks were created with historical research into things like color palettes and artistic references from the relevant classical period. Classical figures like Bach, Beethoven, Hildegard von Bingen, Chopin, John Dowland, Fanny Mendelssohn, Shostakovich, and Tchaikovsky, among other, are represented. Currently, the app is only available on iPhones, so you can’t access the app on Mac or iPad. You have to be running iOS 15.4 or newer to use the app. An Android version is “coming soon.” Because it doesn’t support offline downloads, you’ll need an internet connection to stream from the service. On Monday, Apple also released the iOS 16.4 update, which brings new emojis, notifications for web apps, voice isolation for better call quality and more.  "

183,Discord leak suspect charged with stealing and sharing military secrets,['@tayhatmaker'],"April 14, 2023","After his arrest yesterday, the U.S. Air National Guard airman suspected of sharing a trove of national security secrets with his Discord chat group now faces charges under the Espionage Act. Jack Teixeira, 21, was charged Friday with the unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. Teixeira, an airman with the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base, part of Joint Base Cape Cod. If convicted of the two counts under the Espionage Act, Teixeira could face up to 10 years in prison. Teixeira’s seemingly extraordinary access to classified documents and fresh details about the war in Ukraine was matter of course for his role as a cyber defense operations journeyman, according to the affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint. That document offered some new details of the investigation into Teixeira, including how the FBI identified him. Prior to Teixeira’s arrest, The New York Times and The Washington Post both spoke with members of the Discord server, where a group of online friends bonded over an interest in guns, racist memes and gaming. The Times published Teixeira’s name shortly before his arrest Thursday. On April 12, the FBI obtained the billing details on Teixeira’s server from Discord. Teixeira paid for the Discord server where he shared the secret documents using his real name and an address in North Dighton, Massachusetts where he would soon be arrested. “While Discord places a premium on the privacy of our users, we believe that our platform best serves the needs of all when we collectively engage in responsible online behavior,” a Discord spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Our Terms of Service expressly prohibit using Discord for illegal or criminal purposes, which includes the sharing of documents on Discord that may be verifiably classified.” The company noted that it has since deleted the classified content, banned the accounts involved with its distribution and warned other users who are still sharing the documents on other servers. The airman also apparently used his government device to do a search of classified intelligence reports for the word “leak” on April 6, the same day that public reporting acknowledged the leaked documents. While the cache of documents later bubbled up across public social media sites, they were first shared with a small group of friends through the Discord server Teixeira ran. According to the affidavit, another member of the server said that the posts began in December 2022, first appearing in text form and later as photos of sensitive documents. Those photos included current military intelligence on the operation in Ukraine, including troop movements, and documents that point to U.S. surveillance of allies like South Korea, among other sensitive topics. The documents apparently sat on the small Discord server for months without the U.S. government’s notice before eventually making their way to more popular forums. The FBI’s investigation only began last week, after the classified information began appearing across public social networks."

In an excerpt from her new book “Breaking into Venture,” SemperVirens General Partner Allison Baum Gates revisits her early days as an investor, when establishing deal flow and networking were skills she’d yet to acquire. Drawing from the early chapters of her book, this post includes a target prospect list for new investors, along with relationship-building advice from experienced VCs. “You can spend a lot of time searching for something, but if you’re looking in the wrong places, you’ll never find it,” she writes.

185,How the FBI caught the BreachForums admin,['@lorenzofb'],"March 24, 2023","On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that the now-arrested alleged administrator of the infamous hacking forum BreachForums facilitated the sale and purchase of private information that belonged to “millions of U.S. citizens and hundreds of U.S. and foreign companies, organizations, and government agencies.” In a statement, prosecutors confirmed the arrest of Conor Fitzpatrick, 20, aka Pompompurin, of Peekskill, New York. Fitzpatrick is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, subject to a maximum of five years in prison if convicted. In order to prove that BreachForums facilitated the sale and purchase of stolen or hacked data, FBI undercover agents purchased five sets of data: one of data stolen from an unnamed U.S. internet hosting and security services company, which contained names, addresses, phone numbers, usernames, password hashes, and email addresses for approximately 8,000 customers, as well as payment card information for 1,900 customers; another dataset stolen from an unnamed U.S.-based investment company, containing at least 5 million email addresses; one containing the private information of “large numbers of U.S. persons,” including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, birthdates, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, bank names, routing numbers, and account numbers; another from the same seller, which contained private information and bank account information of around 15 million U.S. persons; and one other set of data taken from a U.S. healthcare company. The feds collected several pieces of evidence to nab Pompompurin. First they got the IP addresses that Pompompurin used to access RaidForums, the predecessor of BreachForums, which was seized by the FBI in April 2022. Nine of those IP addresses were associated with Fitzpatrick, according to his internet service provider Verizon, as FBI Special Agent John Longmire wrote in the affidavit dated March 15, two days before Fitzpatrick’s arrest. In a spectacular snafu on the hacker’s part, Longmire wrote that the second piece of evidence came from Pompompurin himself. In a chat with the RaidForums admin, Pompompurin said he noticed a data breach posted on the site did not include “one of my old emails,” which he looked up on the legitimate data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned. Even though Pompompurin then said “(I don’t want to share my actual email for obvious reasons, but this email seems to have the same case as mine): conorfitzpatrick02@gmail.com,” the agent wrote in the affidavit that that email address was indeed Pompompurin because the FBI obtained records from Google showing that Fitzpatrick registered that address months before that chat. The alleged hacker also had Google Pay accounts linked to both that email address as well as a newer one, “conorfitzpatrick2002@gmail.com,” both linked to a number owned by Fitzpatrick, according to the affidavit. Furthermore, the agent wrote that he obtained more records from Google, which showed conorfitzpatrick2002@gmail.com had a recovery email address funmc59tm@gmail.com linked to an IP address registered to someone with the last name Fitzpatrick and a different phone number, which the agent said he believed belonged to Fitzpatrick’s father. Then, according to the affidavit, Pompompurin used several VPNs to connect to his Gmail account, some of which overlap with his activity elsewhere on the internet. The agent also said that the FBI obtained records from cryptocurrency exchange Purse.io. The company’s records revealed that four of the IP addresses used to connect to the exchange were also used to connect to the conorfitzpatrick2002@gmail.com Gmail account and Pompompurin’s RaidForums account. Moreover, that Purse.io account was registered with the name Conor Fitzpatrick and the email address “conorfitzpatrick2002@gmail.com,” the affidavit said. Those four IP addresses, according to the agent, were owned by VPN providers, which Pompompurin also used to connect to the “conorfitzpatrick2002@gmail.com” account. Another VPN IP address was also used to log into a Zoom account under the name “pompompurin” associated with a Riseup email address also used to register his RaidForums account, according to the affidavit. Records from Purse.io also showed that Fitzpatrick’s account purchased “several items” and shipped them to his address with the phone number the feds had already established was his. Also seven out of nine IP addresses used to connect to Purse.io were also used to connect to Pompompurin’s account on RaidForums. And, finally, the Purse.io account “was funded exclusively by a Bitcoin address that Pompompurin had discussed in posts on RaidForums,” per the affidavit. The evidence does not stop there. In a database of RaidForums forum activity, the feds saw that Pompompurin accessed his account from an IP address registered to Fitzpatrick’s father at the same home address previously identified by the authorities, according to the affidavit. That same IP address was used to access an iCloud account associated with Fitzpatrick, Longmire wrote in the affidavit. Moreover, Longmire noted that the accounts with the handle Pompompurin on RaidForums and BreachForums were likely owned by the same person, as Pompompurin wrote in a post on BreachForums: “if you used RaidForums you most likely remember me, I was one of the more active users on there,” and the new Pompompurin account on BreachForums “alluded to past activity by the pompompurin account on RaidForums.” Finally, Longmire wrote that the FBI obtained a warrant to get Fitzpatrick’s real-time cell phone GPS location from Verizon, allowing agents to observe that Pompompurin was logged in to BreachForums while his phone’s location showed he was at his home. The feds also surveilled Fitzpatrick at his home while agents noted Pompompurin’s account was active on the forum. This trove of evidence allowed law enforcement to obtain a warrant to search Fitzpatrick’s house, where he agreed to speak to the agents and “admitted that he is the user of the pompompurin account,” and that “he owns and administers BreachForums and previously operated the pompompurin account on RaidForums.” The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fitzpatrick’s lawyer also did not respond to a request for comment. Ironically, Fitzpatrick may have thought this day would come when he launched BreachForums. In an interview on the Data Knight website, the interviewer asked him, “Don’t you think that there’s a reason that the FBI took down RaidForums? Why would you want to bring it back up knowing that you may face that same fate whatever it [may be]?” Pompompurin responded: “It doesn’t really bother me. If I get arrested one day it also wouldn’t surprise me, but as I said I have a trusted person who will have full access to everything needed to relaunch it without me.” The Justice Department said in its Friday statement that it had also “conducted a disruption operation that caused BreachForums to go offline.” When reached for comment, DOJ spokesperson Joshua Stueve declined to elaborate. At the time of publication, BreachForums was inaccessible, displaying an error saying “bad gateway,” but the domain still appeared to be in the control of the site’s current administrator. Following the Justice Department’s announcement of Fitzpatrick’s arrest, the person who took over from him, known as Baphomet, announced they would shut down the forum. On Friday, after the affidavit was circulated online, Baphomet wrote a message on a Telegram channel, saying “the most important thing right now of our community is to be aware that the FBI is now confirmed to have access to the Breached database,” and “at this point the entire document will clearly show what I’ve said for the entirety of my time on Breached, and that you shouldn’t trust anyone to handle your own OPSEC. I never made this assumption as an admin, and no one else should have either.” That’s why, Baphomet added, “Simply piling everyone back into the same community without any thought of how we properly move forward safely is basically a death trap.” Do you have information about BreachForums?

186,Microsoft kicks Twitter in the teeth,['@cookie'],"April 19, 2023","Microsoft is dropping Twitter from its advertising platform next week, nearly two months after Twitter announced that it will begin charging a minimum of $42,000 per month to users of its API, which include enterprises and research institutions. Users began receiving emails about its new pricing details in early March, per a Wired report that observed at the time that the new pricing scheme “prices out nearly everyone.” With its $2.15 trillion market cap and roughly $100 billion cash on hand at the end of last year, Microsoft obviously has the money to pay Twitter what it wants, so the move appears to be a bit of a statement, even as Microsoft is declining to elaborate further about its decision. Specifically, what it told its customers today is that, “Starting on April 25, 2023, Smart Campaigns with Multi-platform will no longer support Twitter,” and that “Digital Marketing Center (DMC) will no longer support Twitter starting on April 25, 2023.” The moves mean users will no longer be able to access their Twitter account, or create, schedule or otherwise manage tweets through Microsoft’s free social media management service. As Mashable notes in a related report, companies that use Microsoft Advertising will still be able to manage and create content for Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn through the platform. Unsurprisingly, Twitter owner Elon Musk finds the move galling, even threatening today on Twitter to take legal action. Apparently referring to Microsoft’s licensing arrangement with the AI outfit OpenAI — which trained its powerful AI models on a “vast corpus of diverse text data from the internet,” per OpenAI’s own popular chatbot ChatGPT — Musk tweeted today of Microsoft’s decision, “They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time.” There is reason for some animus between Microsoft and Twitter. In addition to striking a licensing arrangement with OpenAI, Microsoft has invested many billions of dollars into OpenAI, which Musk co-founded in 2015 and left several years later. He has periodically bashed it since, including on Twitter. He also more recently announced he was planning a rival initiative. Either way, the move comes at a lousy time for Musk, who has been more actively working to win over advertisers after reportedly losing more than half of Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers following his takeover of the platform in late October. Just yesterday, he sat onstage in Miami with the chairman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal, reportedly saying during the interview that he is open to hearing legitimate concerns advertisers might have about Twitter but stressing he won’t make changes he doesn’t believe in. Meanwhile, asked on Twitter today about Musk’s decision to charge so much for Twitter’s API access — one entrepreneur with his own controversial past noted that “in some cases,” the move is killing traffic to Twitter from outside sources — Musk responded, “I’m open to ideas, but ripping off the Twitter database, demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others isn’t a winning solution.”"
187,Biden executive order bans federal agencies from using commercial spyware,['@zackwhittaker'],"March 27, 2023","The Biden administration on Monday announced a new executive order that would broadly ban U.S. federal agencies from using commercially developed spyware that poses threats to human rights and national security. The move to ban federal agencies — including law enforcement, defense and intelligence — from using commercial spyware comes as officials confirmed that dozens of U.S. government personnel had their phones targeted. Human rights defenders and security researchers have for years warned of the risks posed by commercial spyware, created in the private sector and sold almost exclusively to governments and nation states. This powerful surveillance technology often exploits previously undisclosed flaws found in an iPhone or Android’s software to steal a person’s photos, contacts, call logs, messages and real-time location data. But while governments claim to exclusively use the technology for investigating serious crimes, critics say the spyware has been deployed against journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders, often those who are vocally critical of their governments. In a call with reporters ahead of the order’s signing, Biden administration officials said that the United States was trying to get ahead of the problem and set standards for other governments and its allies, which buy and deploy commercial spyware. The order is the latest action taken by the government in recent years, including banning some spyware makers from doing business in the U.S. and passing laws aimed at limiting the use and procurement of spyware by federal agencies. Officials wouldn’t name the specific spyware affected by the executive order, though the criteria would likely affect known government spyware makers and vendors known to sell to authoritarian governments that commit human rights abuses, including NSO Group, Cytrox and Candiru. The officials said the order includes both domestic and foreign-made spyware, as to not incentivize companies to relocate to the United States, but that the list of banned spyware would not necessarily be made public. The officials warned that the misuse of these surveillance tools is not limited to authoritarian regimes, noting that democratic governments — including European nations like Greece, Spain and Poland — have also relied on commercial spyware. Last week, former Meta trust and safety manager Artemis Seaford, who holds both U.S. and Greek passports, was confirmed hacked by the Predator spyware, likely at the behest of the Greek government, which denies using the spyware developed by North Macedonian company Cytrox. Seaford, who said she doesn’t know why she was targeted, is the latest known U.S. victim of targeted commercial spyware, including children of targeted journalists living in the U.S. and U.S. government employees working overseas. In 2021, the iPhones of several U.S. Embassy employees in Uganda were hacked by Pegasus, a spyware developed by Israeli company NSO Group. Biden officials confirmed Monday that at least 50 U.S. federal employees in 10 countries on multiple continents are suspected or confirmed as being compromised by spyware, but could not rule out more instances. The U.S. also hasn’t escaped questions about its own alleged use and deployment of commercial spyware. The FBI reportedly bought a license for NSO Group’s Pegasus during 2020 and 2021 but said that the license was only for research and development. The Drug Enforcement Administration also uses Graphite, a spyware tool developed by the Israel-based Paragon. The DEA claims to only use the tool outside of the U.S., but would not say if Americans are targeted. Biden administration officials declined to tell reporters Monday if other U.S. federal agencies are operationally using commercial spyware. The order is the latest in a rash of responses by the executive branch in recent weeks following years of congressional inaction, including gun violence and voting access. As the executive order was introduced as law by the Biden administration, it can be revoked at any time, including by any subsequent administration.  "
188,Bipartisan Senate bill would ban social media algorithms for minors,['@morgan_sung'],"April 27, 2023","In a bipartisan effort to “protect kids from harm,” an unlikely cohort of senators introduced a bill that would restrict minors’ access to social media, as well as ban companies from using algorithms to recommend content to minors.  Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Murphy (D-Conn), Katie Britt (R-Ala) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark) introduced the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act on Wednesday. The bill would set a minimum age of 13 to use social media sites, and would require parental consent and age verification for users under 18.  “The growing evidence is clear: social media is making kids more depressed and wreaking havoc on their mental health. While kids are suffering, social media companies are profiting. This needs to stop,” Schatz said in a press release. “Our bill will help us stop the growing social media health crisis among kids by setting a minimum age and preventing companies from using algorithms to automatically feed them addictive content based on their personal information.” While some social media companies, like TikTok and YouTube, have launched kid-friendly versions of their platforms with content limits and parental controls, age verification is largely based on an honor system.  If the bill is signed into law, social media companies will be forbidden from using the “personal data” of any user to recommend content “unless the platform knows or reasonably believes that the individual is age 18 or older according to the age verification process used by the platform,” the bill’s text reads. Advertising to minors will still be allowed, as long as it’s “solely based on context,” and isn’t “targeted or recommended based on the personal data” of the user. The bill’s language doesn’t outline how algorithms will be regulated. A representative for Schatz did not immediately respond to request for comment.  On Twitter, users have already raised concerns about the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, and questioned whether the proposed regulations are even enforceable.  “Broadly speaking I’d say this: yes, Big Tech companies are harming kids,” Evan Greer, director of the digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future, said in a tweet responding to Murphy. “We stop that by forcing those companies to change their business practices, not by kicking kids off the internet or taking away kids rights.”  Alejandra Caraballo, a civil rights attorney and clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, also responded to Murphy’s tweet announcing the bill, in which he described prohibiting algorithms for kids.  “With all due respect Senator, but that is a terribly misinformed statement about social media technology. You might as well try saying you’re banning javascript for teens,” she said.  Murphy decried social media companies as “100% committed to addicting our children to their screens” in a press release.  “The alarm bells about social media’s devastating impact on kids have been sounding for a long time, and yet time and time again, these companies have proven they care more about profit than preventing the well-documented harm they cause,” he said. “In particular, these algorithms are sending many down dangerous online rabbit holes, with little chance for parents to know what their kids are seeing online.”   Most social media policies already require users to be at least 13 years old, but enforcement is flimsy at best. Minors can easily fly under the radar by submitting a fake date of birth and checking off a box attesting to their supposed age. The bill would require social media platforms to take “reasonable steps beyond merely requiring attestation,” instead employing “existing age verification technologies” to ensure that users are the age they claim to be.  The bill’s language forbids companies from storing and using any information collected during the verification process “for any other purpose.” It instead proposes a free “Pilot Program,” regulated by the Secretary of Commerce, that would provide “secure digital identification credential to individuals who are citizens and lawful residents of the United States.”  The Pilot Program is supposed to “meet or exceed the highest cybersecurity standards” of consumer products, and the bill promises that only anonymized aggregate data will be stored.  This isn’t the first bipartisan effort to try and curb kids’ internet use. Last year, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn) introduced the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which would require sites to provide more parental control tools and limit the content that users under 16 can access. Dozens of civil liberties organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fight for the Future and GLAAD, opposed the bill.  The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act follows a larger nationwide push for age verification online. This year, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia and Utah passed laws requiring users to submit a government-issued ID in order to view porn sites. Eleven more states have proposed similar laws. But digital privacy advocates have expressed concerns over how age verification data is stored and used.  In the joint letter opposing KOSA, civil liberties organizations warned against age verification requirements.  “Age verification requirements may require users to provide platforms with personally identifiable information such as date of birth and government-issued identification documents, which can threaten users’ privacy, including through the risk of data breaches, and chill their willingness to access sensitive information online because they cannot do so anonymously,” the letter said. “Rather than age-gating privacy settings and safety tools to apply to only minors, Congress should focus on ensuring that all users, regardless of age, benefit from strong privacy protections by passing comprehensive privacy legislation.” "
189,SpaceX’s Starship didn’t self-destruct immediately as planned during test launch,['@etherington'],"May 1, 2023","SpaceX’s recent Starship test flight, the first during which it flew with its Super Heavy orbital booster, was a bit more of a mess than it even appeared when it ended with a large explosion. During a Twitter Space on Saturday, SpaceX founder and Twitter owner Elon Musk shared more details about the launch, which he still characterized as “successful” relative to SpaceX’s aims with the mission. During the launch, it was obvious things weren’t going exactly to plan when, at the point during the flight when the first-stage booster was supposed to separate from the Starship upper stage, the two pieces did not come apart — and instead the entire launch vehicle appeared to start falling back to Earth while spiraling wildly. Starship is equipped with an automated self-destruct feature that’s designed to reduce the risk of an out-of-control return to Earth for the massive spacecraft. Musk revealed that the command didn’t work immediately in this most recent flight attempt, with 40 seconds passing instead before it actually resulted in an explosion that destroyed the bulk of the rocket. Musk also revealed additional details about what went wrong with the flight, including the fact that three of the rocket’s 33 total engines didn’t even participate in the launch thrust, having shut down before Starship left the pad. That resulted in a “lean” as the spacecraft ascended, which is not intended behavior. Finally, just under 30 seconds into the launch, one of the remaining Raptor 2 engines had a fault that also damaged other engines near it. At about a minute and a half in, the engines lost their ability to control the direction of the launch vehicle, which is why that spinning occurred. The original take-off also included unplanned events, like the massive cloud of dust and debris generated by the destruction of the concrete launch pad that resulted from the lift-off thrust. This sent debris hurtling around the launch facility surroundings — and new satellite images show some of the impact of the event. We finally have the first public satellite imagery of SpaceX's Starbase launch site after Starship launched 10 days ago. Look closely and you can see the damage to the propellant tanks, concrete beneath the pad and more. pic.twitter.com/IyKBznNsT3 — Harry Stranger (@Harry__Stranger) May 1, 2023 "
190,Amazon quietly acquired audio content discovery engine Snackable AI to boost its podcast projects,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 5, 2023","Amazon quietly acquired New York–based audio content discovery engine Snackable AI last December to boost its podcast features, as first reported by New York Post. The tech giant told TechCrunch in an email on Friday that the Snackable AI team joined Amazon Music to work on existing podcast projects. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Snackable AI founder and CEO Mari Joller is now an AI and machine learning product leader at Amazon Music, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her profile notes that she leads “a team of engineers, applied scientists and computational linguists to build AI-powered products for Amazon Music Podcasts’ customers.” Founded in 2018, Snackable AI specialized in using AI to add structure and metadata to video and audio easily with AI-generated chapters, highlights and more. The company’s technology provides an “at a glance” view to make consuming content fast and efficient. Joller’s LinkedIn profile says Snackable AI joined Amazon “to continue innovating and exploring new experiences on behalf of Amazon Music Podcasts’ customers.” Snackable AI raised $3.1 million in funding before being acquired by Amazon, according to Crunchbase. Amazon added podcasts to its Music platform back in 2020 and has since been building out the offering and adding new features, such as synched transcripts. Last November, the company made most of the top podcasts on its service available without ads for Prime members. The Amazon Music app was also updated to include a new “Podcast Previews” feature that lets customers listen to short clips as a way to discover new podcasts they may like. At the same time, Amazon began offering Prime subscribers a full music catalog with 100 million songs, instead of the previously more limited selection of just 2 million songs. The move was seen as a way for Amazon Music to lure some subscribers away from other music services, like Apple Music or Spotify. The tech giant closed the acquisition at a time when major companies, including Microsoft and Google, were racing to implement AI-powered features into the products following the launch and subsequent popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Amazon was among many other tech companies that touted the potential of AI during its latest quarterly earnings call last month. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed during a call with investors that the company is building a more “generalized and capable” large language model (LLM) to power Alexa.  "
191,The Security Stage debuts at Disrupt 2023,['@zackwhittaker'],"April 11, 2023","If you haven’t noticed, the internet is frequently on fire. Overseas cyberattacks are hitting public services like healthcare at home. Data breaches are the new school “snow days.” Small towns and local governments are largely unable to fend off ransomware attacks on their own. Nation-state hackers are undermining human rights and the security and privacy of millions by hacking into phones using undisclosed security flaws. And the emerging world of web3 balances precariously on the fragile foundations of Web 2.0’s problematic past. But it’s not all doom and gloom. This year, TechCrunch is taking on some of the biggest security and privacy problems head-on at Disrupt 2023 with the sharpest minds and pros in the industry. And there is a lot to talk about. The debut Security Stage is the one-stop shop for all things security and privacy at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023. By drawing on firsthand reporting from TechCrunch’s security desk this past year, we’re exploring the most pressing and important issues facing tech giants, startups and billions of citizens around the world with the people who know the challenges best. How do we protect our most valuable information from hostile states without establishing U.S. data laws at home? What can early companies do today to protect users’ data from overreaching surveillance? How do we know to trust the security of the phones in our pockets? Can governments keep cyberspace safe and protect our information without compromising its values or violating human rights? Will web3 be the future financial powerhouse without fixing the problems from yesteryear? Just how on fire are we? We’ll hear from founders trying to solve the problems and how governments are reacting and responding to the growing threats like spyware, cyberattacks on public services, and election integrity. And we’ll hear from frontline defenders and seasoned professionals with a collective firehose of experience and insight to help today’s emerging companies prepare for the challenges ahead. In previous years we’ve heard from U.S. government agencies like CISA and the NSA, federal lawmakers working to protect Americans’ data, top security executives, and human rights defenders.

192,Kids tech camp iD Tech still silent weeks after data breach,['@zackwhittaker'],"March 23, 2023","Parents are still looking for answers weeks after hackers stole the personal data of thousands of users from kids’ tech coding camp iD Tech, with some fearing that their children’s data was compromised in the data breach. iD Tech, which provides on-campus classes and online tech and coding courses for kids, has yet to acknowledge the breach or notify parents. News of the data breach broke in February after a hacker on a cybercrime forum claimed to have hacked iD Tech a month earlier on January 3. The hacker claimed to have stolen close to 1 million user records, including names, dates of birth, passwords stored in plaintext and about 415,000 unique email addresses, which iD Tech did not dispute when reached by email. That can equate to each parent’s account having one or more kids in classes at the tech camp. Some parents only found out as recently as March 6 when data breach notification services like Have I Been Pwned obtained the data and sent out notifications to affected families. Other parents found out when other services, like Firefox or their device security software, notified them that their information was found in the breached data. One parent, who learned from a breach notification service that their data had been stolen, told TechCrunch that the stolen information is only a portion of the data that iD Tech collects on account holders and the children who use its platform, including gender, billing information and some health data, like immunizations. The parent said that the breached data must relate to the child’s date of birth because they never provided their own. The parent said that iD Tech has not yet notified them of the breach. When the parent contacted the company to inquire, iD Tech claimed that it had already notified affected account holders. Indeed, iD Tech has not publicly acknowledged the breach, either on its website or any of its social media channels. And there’s no evidence that iD Tech has notified affected account holders of the breach, either. When reached by email, iD Tech CEO Pete Ingram-Cauchi declined to explain why the company hasn’t publicly acknowledged the breach. When asked, Ingram-Cauchi declined to provide a copy of the communication that iD Tech claims to have sent to parents. The company declined to say if the breach had been reported to offices of state attorneys general per data breach notification laws. Instead, iD Tech provided a brief statement from a generic company email address declining to comment, citing its ongoing investigation. The sender of the email declined to provide their name for this story. Ingram-Cauchi did not reply to a follow-up email."
193,Covariant’s robotic picking AI nabs another $75M,['@bheater'],"April 4, 2023","I took a deep dive with Covariant co-founder and CEO Peter Chen at ProMat the other week. The timing was either perfect or terrible depending on who you ask. I’m sure the startup’s comms people are thrilled that I’m writing a follow-up a week later on the occasion of a new funding round. Regardless, $75 million is a hard number to ignore — especially as the Series C extension brings the AI firm’s total raise up to $222 million. Existing investors Radical Ventures and Index Ventures led the round, which also features returning (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Amplify Partners) and new (Gates Frontier Holdings, AIX Ventures and Northgate Capital) investors. The round adds on to an $80 million Series C announced in July 2021. “This investment allows us to further develop the Covariant Brain as a more capable foundation model and to apply the Covariant Brain to even more use cases across a wide variety of sectors,” Chen tells TechCrunch. “With eCommerce demand continuing to grow and supply chain resilience becoming more important, we’ve made tremendous progress with global retailers and logistics providers, and are looking forward to revealing more details on these partnerships soon.” I was also treated to a demo of Covariant’s tech at the show last month. It’s quite impressive when you know what’s going on beneath the hood to power its picking and placing. At the heart of the logistics play is the Covariant Brain, which is building a massive database of potential package sizes, shapes and materials based on real-world picks. In our conversation, Chen used generative AI/ChatGPT as an analogy. It’s more than just a tenuous connection to the latest hype cycle, however, as three of the team’s four co-founders have a direct connection to OpenAI. Chen says: Before the recent ChatGPT, there were a lot of natural language processing AIs out there. Search, translate, sentiment detection, spam detection — there were loads of natural language AIs out there. The approach before GPT is, for each use case, you train a specific AI to it, using a smaller subset of data. Look at the results now, and GPT basically abolishes the field of translation, and it’s not even trained to translation. The foundation model approach is basically, instead of using small amounts of data that’s specific to one situation or train a model that’s specific to one circumstance, let’s train a large foundation-generalized model on a lot more data, so the AI is more generalized. The funding will be used to further the deployment of Covariant’s system to retailers and logistics firms.  "

195,India opts against AI regulation,['@refsrc'],"April 5, 2023","India does not plan to regulate the growth of AI within the South Asian market, identifying the sector as a “significant and strategic” area for the nation. This stance arrives at a time when numerous voices are calling for increased scrutiny of the rapidly advancing technology. The Ministry of Electronics and IT said in a long written response on Wednesday that it has assessed the ethical concerns and risks of bias and discrimination associated with AI. The ministry said it’s implementing necessary policies and infrastructure measures to cultivate a robust AI sector in the country, but does not intend to introduce legislation to regulate its growth. The expansion of AI will have a “kinetic effect” on entrepreneurship and business development in India, the ministry asserted. “AI is a kinetic enabler of the digital economy and innovation ecosystem. Government is harnessing the potential of AI to provide personalized and interactive citizen-centric services through digital public platforms.” In spite of the burgeoning interest in artificial intelligence in the U.S. and many developed markets, India has seen a limited number of startups entering the field. A strategic initiative from New Delhi could potentially encourage talented individuals to explore opportunities. India’s decision, which impacts the world’s second-largest internet market, comes as tech entrepreneurs and academics increasingly call for government intervention in AI. Last week, more than 1,100 signatories, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, signed an open letter urging “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.” Italy recently imposed a temporary ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, citing concerns that it violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns about AI, few are actively pursuing regulation, The New York Times reported last month."
196,Bobsled raises $17M Series A to make cross-cloud data sharing easier,['@fredericl'],"April 25, 2023","Bobsled, a startup that is building a cross-cloud data sharing platform, today announced that it has raised a $17 million Series A funding round co-led by Greycroft and Madrona Venture Group. This round follows a $7 million seed round led by .406 Ventures. In this most recent round, Bobsled’s valuation was $87 million. Prior to founding Bobsled in late 2021, the company’s CEO and co-founder Jake Graham was a principal product manager at Microsoft Azure, working on the Azure Data Exchange. Graham, who also previously worked at Neo4j and Intel, believes that data sharing is going to be a fundamental change in the analytics landscape. “It’s the next evolution of how companies actually get access to the data that they need to drive machine learning analytics, data science, what have you,” he said. “I’ve been building in the data infrastructure space for about a decade and that APIs and SFTP were the way in which data moved was just one of those things that I accepted. It wasn’t until I really started digging into it that I was: it shouldn’t be. This doesn’t make a lot of sense. These are built for a previous paradigm of data.” Image Credits: Bobsled Image Credits: Bobsled Graham also believes that it’s important for the clouds and data platform to create the building blocks of what a native sharing protocol should look like. “If you believe that data sharing is the way the world is going to go and that there’s going to be much more active collaboration on data between source and destination, you kind of need there to be something that brings all of these different platforms together, because there’s not one right cloud, there’s not one right data warehouse, there’s not one right layer of the stack for it to make data sharing happen,” he said. Bobsled, unsurprisingly, believes that it can be this neural, third-party data sharing platform that can allow businesses to connect their various data sources in a more native way. The service uses each platform’s sharing protocol and then connects the various sources and helps businesses prepare the datasets for querying them. Image Credits: Bobsled Image Credits: Bobsled Some of the common use cases here are SaaS applications that may want to share application data from AWS S3 into a customer’s Azure storage, for example, or a data team that wants to move sales data from Azure to S3 for analysis. Obviously, there are other companies that focus on this kind of data transfer and data transformation space. But Graham believes that with these ELT platforms like Fivetran, the consumer still has to do too much work. “A lot of what actually is being done by ELT platforms should be done by the source of the data,” he said. “So we’re shifting left a lot of that. If you pull apart the letters, extract: you’re doing that because it’s not being shared with you. Load? Same thing. If you’re getting a share within Databricks, you’re not loading into anything.” As for transforming data, he noted that most of the time, the data is in a transactional data model that needs to be formatted for analysis and the source should transform that data — though he believes that transforming the data from multiple data sources to match a given scheme is always going to be up to the consumer. “I wouldn’t call us directly an ELT product yet because we’re different enough, but I think that’s the closest thing to the category that we’re building. It’s just a different user,” Graham explained. The company plans to use the new funding to build out its platform, mostly with a focus on support for more data sources (including old-school SFTP sources). “The promise of AI only heightens the urgency and increases the priority for companies to realize the value of their data,” said Madrona Managing Director S. Somasegar. “Even within enterprises and amongst partners, that data is now spread across platforms not designed to work together. Bobsled‘s unique cross-cloud data sharing focus will unlock the value of data that has been complex, slow and expensive to access until now.”"
197,6 River Systems co-founder on the state of warehouse robots,['@bheater'],"March 24, 2023","Robots have conquered ProMat. The supply chain and logistics show is a kind of perfect microcosm of where the industry is heading. Many of the show’s main attractions have moved from center stage to the physical margins of the show floor, while competitors like 6 River Systems and Locus grab the spotlight — my interviews with both happened in conference areas located on the second floor of their massive booths. Among other things, this proved an ideal setting for speaking with founders and executives of some of the space’s biggest players. Jerome Dubois ticks both of those boxes as the co-founder of 6 River Systems, and he now serves as VP of Shopify Logistics, following the e-commerce giant’s 2019 acquisition of the robotics firm. We spoke about the role of Amazon in the company’s foundation and what the future looks like for robotic picking and interoperability. TC: What is the 6 River story? JD: I’ve been in the industry for 25 years. Got my start on the software side, so warehouse management systems — [at] a company called Yantra, which is now a part of IBM. I joined Kiva in 2008; was there through the acquisition. I was [Locus CEO Rick Faulk’s] predecessor and Bruce Welty was my customer. I’m the one who told Bruce that “we’re shutting your systems down.” Small worlds inside of small worlds. Yeah. But we have a ton of respect for that team. We’re the two leaders in this space, between Locus and us. Fetch is probably a distant third after that. Both you and Fetch were acquired. Yeah. We were acquired in 2019. Fetch was acquired [in 2021]. Why was that the right move? Had you considered IPO’ing or moving in a different direction? In 2019, when we were raising money, we were doing well. But Shopify presents itself and says, “Hey, we’re interested in investing in the space. We want to build out a logistics network. We need technology like yours to make it happen. We’ve got the right team; you know about the space. Let’s see if this works out.” What we’ve been able to do is leverage a tremendous amount of investment from Shopify to grow the company. We were about 120 employees at 30 sites. We’re at 420 employees now and over 110 sites globally. Amazon buys Kiva and cuts off third-party access to their robots. That must have been a discussion you had with Shopify. Up front. “If that’s what the plan is, we’re not interested.” We had a strong positive trajectory; we had strong investors. Everyone was really bullish on it. That’s not what it’s been. It’s been the opposite. We’ve been run independently from Shopify. We continue to invest and grow the business. From a business perspective, I understand Amazon’s decision to cut off access and give itself a leg up. What’s in it for Shopify if anyone can still deploy your robots? Shopify’s mantra is very different from Amazon. I’m responsible for Shopify’s logistics. Shopify is the brand behind the brand, so they have a relationship with merchants and the customers. They want to own a relationship with the merchant. It’s about building the right tools and making it easier for the merchant to succeed. Supply chain is a huge issue for lots of merchants. To sell the first thing, they have to fulfill the first thing, so Shopify is making it easier for them to print off a shipping label. Now, if you’ve got to do 100 shipping letters a day, you’re not going to do that by yourself. You want us to fulfill it for you, and Shopify built out a fulfillment network using a lot of third parties, and our technology is the backbone of the warehouse. Your technology was built for brownfield structures. That’s correct. We can go in and just implement with the technology. We can go into existing customer warehouses without having to change anything. That allows for a very quick implementation timeframe. That’s one of the big advantages. We get to that double productivity in a matter of weeks, as opposed to having to wipe out a building and start fresh with a new system. But if they want to go greenfield, you can start from scratch and actually build around the technology. That’s right. Maybe 10% of our install base is greenfield. Watching you — Locus or Fetch — you’re more or less maintaining a form factor. Obviously, Amazon is diversifying. For many of these customers, I imagine the ideal robot is something that’s not only mobile and autonomous, but also actually does the picking itself. Is this something you’re exploring? Most of the AMR (autonomous mobile robot) scene has gotten to a point where the hardware is commoditized. The robots are generally pretty reliable. Some are maybe higher quality than others, but what matters the most is the workflows that are being enacted by these robots. The big thing that’s differentiating Locus and us is, we actually come in with predefined workflows that do a specific kind of work. It’s not just a generic robot that comes in and does stuff. So you can integrate it into your workflow very quickly, because it knows you want to do a batch pick and sortation. It knows that you want to do discreet order picking. Those are all workflows that have been predefined and prefilled in the solution. With respect to the solving of the grabbing and picking, I’ve been on the record for a long time saying it’s a really hard problem. I’m not sure picking in e-comm or out of the bin is the right place for that solution. If you think about the infrastructure that’s required to solve going into an aisle and grabbing a pink shirt versus a blue shirt in a dark aisle using robots, it doesn’t work very well, currently. That’s why goods-to-person makes more sense in that environment. If you try to use arms, a Kiva-like solution or a shuttle-type solution, where the inventory is being brought to a station and the lighting is there, then I think arms are going to be effective there. Are these the kinds of problems you invest R&D in? Not the picking side. In the world of total addressable market — the industry as a whole, between Locus, us, Fetch and others — is at maybe 5% penetration. I think there’s plenty of opportunity for us to go and implement a lot of our technology in other places. I also think the logical expansion is around the case and pallet operations. Interoperability is an interesting conversation. No one makes robots for every use case. If you want to get near full autonomous, you’re going to have a lot of different robots. We are not going to be a fit for 100% of the picks in the building. For the 20% that we’re not doing, you still leverage all the goodness of our management consoles, our training and that kind of stuff, and you can extend out with [the mobile fulfillment application]. And it’s not just picking. It’s receiving, it’s put away and whatever else. It’s the first step for us, in terms of proving wall-to-wall capabilities. What does interoperability look like beyond that? We do system interoperability today. We interface with automation systems all the time out in the field. That’s an important part of interoperability. We’re passing important messages on how big a box we need to build and in what sequence it needs to be built. When you’re independent, you’re focused on getting to portability. Does that pressure change when you’re acquired by a Shopify? I think the difference with Shopify is, it allows us to think more long-term in terms of doing the right thing without having the pressure of investors. That was one of the benefits. We are delivering lots of longer-term software bets."
198,A knife so sharp you don’t feel it cut,['@etherington'],"April 3, 2023","There’s an ongoing and heated debate about whether generative AI — like the technology that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT — is either an overblown parlor trick or an existential threat to humanity that’s already raging out of control. The truth is, of course, some more nuanced point between these two extremes, but no matter what side you’re on, you should realize it’s already powerful enough to reshape industries and provoke another transformational shift in the broader working world. It’s an odd feeling being employed in one of those industries that seems likely to be most impacted by the changes wrought by generative AI. Overall, it’s becoming clear that the fields that will feel it most will be white-collar and knowledge workers: It turns out it’s much harder to program a real-world robot to be able to interact with and manipulate its surroundings than it is to create a virtual sophist or a bot that groks the secret power language of code. Some days, I honestly feel like how I imagine the dinosaurs would watch that extinction event meteor burning through the atmosphere: It feels momentous, but also too big to comprehend. At other times, there’s an awareness and a sense of urgency around efforts to anticipate and incorporate generative AI into our workflow and products. There’s a crackle and an energy toward action, but it’s also a bit flailing, a tad shapeless and carries just a whiff of desperation. A few things are becoming clear regarding where and how generative AI can already excel, and genuinely replace a human equivalent. It’s exceedingly good at replicating the bland, toothless communication style prized in internal/external missives by large corporates whose primary motivating factor in most of those messages is avoiding offense. Basically, it’s perfectly fluent in CorpSpeak™ and pretty decent at bland and uninspired marketing copy — which probably makes up a significant percentage of the demand for marketing copy in terms of volume. Like with the knife analogy in the headline, these scattered use cases feel innocuous at first — time-saving and productivity-enhancing helpers in a few instances. Who doesn’t want to offload that high-level executive summary, or exsanguinate their company-wide email to ensure it gets across the basic point in a way that’s guaranteed to never approach even a hint of offense? And who hasn’t dreaded having to write a brief description of an online seminar, or a 200-word bio for a speaking engagement? It doesn’t feel deep — these types of tasks are the definition of shallow. On the coding side, it’s basically cobbling together readily available built examples to achieve a simulacrum of what you wanted that looks and feels so real it might as well be. Which is exactly what it’s doing on the language output side, too. But those who find comfort in this as a fixed depth limit are likely underestimating the pace of development on the one side, and the degree to which a facsimile of true depth is just as good as the real thing on the other. Also, it’s important to recognize that as shallow as they may feel, these examples are all things being done at massive scale currently by real, actual living, breathing human beings who have little or no understanding that to a large extent, they may already be redundant. There’s a recent example of an everyday job that’s relatively straightforward being slowly but surely subsumed by a technological solution that could stand as a good analogue for AI’s march: self-checkout. When those self-checkout stations started popping up at grocery stores and retailers around a decade ago, customers and clerks alike looked at them as an odd, awkward and mildly humorous intrusion on their well-established space: Fast-forward to today, and they’ve cut checkout staff to a tiny fraction of their former size at many medium and large retailers. It’s still possible the cut is mostly superficial — but it’s also possible the blood is welling its way to the surface and simply hasn’t yet broken through. Plenty of other world-changing innovations seemed like toys or diversions at first, and were received as such by the people they ultimately impacted most, either out of genuine ignorance, or out of a reluctance to look an existential threat in the eye. That more or less applies to the printing press, the automobile, the computer, the smartphone and the internet. Which still leaves the question of what to do about it — or whether the time for that question is already passed."
199,"Plex’s music player, Plexamp, now works with ChatGPT for playlist creation",['@sarahintampa'],"May 3, 2023","Plexamp, the music player originally incubated by the Labs division of media company Plex, is tapping into ChatGPT with its latest update. The company announced today a new feature called “Sonic Sage,” powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, that will build unique music playlists by scanning users’ libraries and leveraging their TIDAL subscription. The update follows other efforts around using AI interfaces to program users’ music selections. Spotify, notably, launched an AI DJ to both introduce and select music for its streaming app users, while other third-party apps like Petey are now using ChatGPT to make Apple Music playlists. In Plex’s case, it’s using the feature for its music player side project for the time being, not its main media player app. First launched in 2017 as the debut project from Plex Labs, Plexamp was introduced as Plex’s spin on the classic Winamp media player app, even offering visualizations to accompany your tunes. It later expanded from the desktop to iOS and Android, and got an overhaul, becoming a subscriber-only service. Image Credits: Plex Image Credits: Plex In addition to being a way to enjoy music in a classic interface aimed at audiophiles, the app has also served as a way for Plex to experiment with different technologies. For instance, in 2021, it was updated with a “Super Sonic” feature that would match songs that were “sonically similar” to one another, instead of using metadata alone for programming mixes. Now, Plexamp will add support for ChatGPT, the company says. Image Credits: Plex Image Credits: Plex The new feature, dubbed Sonic Sage, lets users create their own playlists by using natural language to describe what they want to hear. For example, the company suggests users could ask for things like “mellow ballads by heavy metal bands,” “upbeat electronics tracks from The Chainsmokers and other DJ duos,” “psychedelic indie rock like Pink Floyd,” “70s grooves by powerhouse women,” and more. To use the option, users must be a Plex Pass subscriber and they must also subscribe to TIDAL’s streaming music service, which is Plex’s music partner. They’ll then need to create an OpenAI account in order to enter an OpenAI API key in Plexamp settings to enable Sonic Sage. The company notes you can limit its results only to music in your own library via a setting next to the API key. In addition to the new AI offering, the app has several other music discovery options, including the ability to use a variety of DJ modes, go on machine-learning “sonic adventures,” use “mood radios,” travel back in time to rediscover oldies and more. Plexamp now works across iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux and Headless, the company notes."
200,"After New Zealand, Australia bans TikTok on official devices",['@indianidle'],"April 3, 2023","Australia has joined a long list of western countries banning TikTok on official devices today. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced the move and said the prohibition will be implemented  “as soon as practicable.” Dreyfus said that the decision was taken “after receiving advice from intelligence and security agencies.” breaking: attorney-general Mark Dreyfus confirms a ban on TikTok on Commonwealth government devices ""The direction will come into effect as soon as practicable. Exemptions will only be granted on a case-by-case basis and with appropriate security mitigations in place"" pic.twitter.com/WaVzqZ7rhk — Josh Butler (@JoshButler) April 4, 2023  Additionally, Australia also made changes to its Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), noting that TikTok poses a security threat because of its data collection practices. “The TikTok application poses significant security and privacy risks to non-corporate Commonwealth entities arising from an extensive collection of user data and exposure to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflicts with Australian law,” the directive said. The authorities said that it will allow the use of the short video app for “a legitimate business reason” and on a separate “standalone device.” Australia’s move is in line with neighbor New Zeland and other Five Eyes collective members the US, the UK, and Canada — all of which have banned TikTok’s usage on official devices. Separately, the EU and Belgium have also prohibited the ByteDance-owned app on the devices of authorities. In response to the Australian government’s decision, TikTok said that it is disappointed by the move. “We are extremely disappointed by this decision, which, in our view, is driven by politics, not by fact. We are also disappointed that TikTok, and the millions of Australians who use it, were left to learn of this decision through the media, despite our repeated offers to engage with government constructively about this policy.” “Again, we stress that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok is in any way a security risk to Australians and should not be treated differently to other social media platforms. Our millions of Australian users deserve a government which makes decisions based upon facts and who treats all businesses fairly, regardless of country of origin,” Lee Hunter, general manager, TikTok Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement. Last month, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before the U.S Congress in a grueling five-hour session. In the hearing, Chew tried to assure lawmakers that Chinese authorities don’t have access to U.S. users’ data. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” he said.   ByteDance is under pressure from the Biden administration to sell off TikTok US or face an embargo. Meanwhile, TikTok is on a $1.5 billion charm offensive, dubbed “Project Texas,” to appease U.S. authorities and squash their doubts about data transparency.   The story has been updated with TikTok’s response."

According to a 2022 study by Adobe, around 45% of Gen Z creators surveyed said they want to earn money from their content. However, given the recent drama surrounding major social media apps, with Meta discontinuing its monthly Reels Play bonus program and the potential TikTok ban, many creators are getting worried. Sixty percent of Gen Z creators use TikTok to monetize content, the study said. Fanfix, a Patreon competitor that is focused on Gen Z creators and only allows clean content, may provide an extra revenue stream for creators. The subscription content monetization platform enables influencers to earn money directly from their followers. Fanfix has attracted more than 10 million users — including 3,000 creators, the company claims. The average annual income for active creators is $70,000, its data shows. As of this month, Fanfix says it paid out $11 million to creators so far, with projections to be at $50 million by the end of the year. It also claims a revenue run rate of $35 million and believes it will be profitable by Q1 2024, co-founder Harry Gestetner told TechCrunch. The figures are notable for a two-year-old startup, especially when the current market makes it harder for creator-focused startups to succeed. Image Credits: Fanfix Image Credits: Fanfix Fanfix is a web application where creators can create a membership, set a paywall and then post content behind the paywall. Creators can set their own subscription price, with the minimum cost being $5 per month and the maximum being $50. Influencers can also earn even more with features like “Tip-to-DM” a pay-to-message feature that allows fans to pay between $3 to $500 to chat privately with their favorite creators. Fanfix also recently launched a one-time purchases feature as well as a new message blast feature, where creators can reach out to all their subscribers at once. Other features in the works include one-to-one calls, personalized videos and livestreaming. Additionally, Fanfix has an analytics dashboard, allowing users to track their earnings, subscriber count and other performance metrics. This can be a useful tool if creators want to share metrics with brands and hopefully land opportunities. Image Credits: Fanfix Image Credits: Fanfix The platform generates revenue by taking a 20% commission fee. This is a little high compared to a few competitors, such as Fanhouse, which only takes 10%. Patreon requires creators to sign up for one of its subscription plans, charging a monthly fee that ranges from 5% to 12%. Although Fanfix doesn’t plan to lower the commission fee, the company pointed out that it has no hidden fees and offers a more “premium service” than most competitors, said Gestetner. “If you look at other platforms, a lot of them charge the creators a payment processing fee. So, there are a lot of hidden fees, and we’re very transparent about how we monetize,” added co-founder Simon Pompan. “Fanfix is one in this space that’s emerging as the leader in the clean Gen Z-first monetization space because our platform, very simply, has been the place where creators earn the most money,” Gestetner said. “Creators generally are very happy with the commission fee because they know that they’re earning more money on our platform than they do elsewhere.” Simon Pompan (left) and Harry Gestetner (right).

Image Credits: Fanfix Gestetner and Pompan have been friends since high school and launched Fanfix in August 2021 when they were attending college. Shortly after launching Fanfix, Gestetner and Pompan brought Vine star Cameron Dallas onto the team. The idea of Fanfix came about when Gestetner’s cousin blew up on TikTok, gaining tens of millions of views yet was unable to monetize. After doing some research, Gestetner found that a lot of creators were struggling to make money. In general, the creator economy can be a tricky space to tackle — especially for full-time, smaller creators looking to make ends meet. Smaller creators seldom secure brand deals, let alone consistent ones that provide a stable revenue stream. “Brand deals underserved a vast majority of creators, and there needed to be a way that creators could monetize directly from their loyal fans without having to rely on brands, agents, studios or record labels. There was a gap in the market for a clean, family-friendly Gen Z fan membership platform,” he said. Fanfix’s target audience is 13 to 24 years old, so the platform has strict content guidelines and prohibits nudity as well as content that promotes illegal activities. The platform makes sure to protect users and creators under 18 with additional safety features like report functions and human moderators that monitor private messages 24/7, as well as review creator accounts twice a day. Regardless of a creator’s age, they can use the “safe mode” feature, which allows them to enable human-reviewed messages. Overall, the entire platform is human-moderated. Fanfix only accepts creators with a follower count of 10,000 or more. The creator must fit with Fanfix’s “brand image” and be able to convert. We spoke with Savannah Rae Demers, a 22-year-old content creator who started using Fanfix in the spring of 2022. Demers said that, so far, she has made nearly $100,000 on the platform. “My subscription rate is currently $8, which leaves me making around $6.40 from each subscriber per month,” Demers told us. “With around 2,100 subscribers, that is already about $13,500 a month just from subscribers. That does not even include additional tips and earnings from messaging.” Fanfix hosts other successful creators, including Madi Monroe, Brooke Monk and Anna Shumate, among others. There is an average of approximately 200 Fanfix subscribers per creator on the platform, according to the company. “I was immediately intrigued with the overall concept of this platform — having a place to document behind-the-scenes content and not having only brand deals to rely on sounded pretty great to me! Also having a place to truly chat and engage with my community of followers is super special to me and that is exactly what Fanfix gave me with the messaging side of the platform,” Demers added.

(opens in a new window) Gestetner and Pompan were only 21 and 23, respectively, when they sold Fanfix to SuperOrdinary in June 2022 for eight figures. SuperOrdinary partners with more than 140 brands, such as Farmacy, OLAPLEX, The Honest Company and more. SuperOrdinary has its own e-commerce platform called GalaGala, which offers a selection of brands curated by influencers. Eventually, Fanfix creators will be able to collaborate with SuperOrdinary to sell products in their own online stores. “Being a part of Fanfix, these creators get access to the whole SuperOrdinary ecosystem. Whether it’s giving access to the brands or whatever it is, access to a system that really no other platform can provide,” Gestetner said. In November 2022, the company launched SuperLink, a monetization-focused link-in-bio platform that displays a creator’s Fanfix page. Creators get 46% of the ad revenue.  "
202,Citymapper lowers the paywall for premium features but keeps monthly subscription for removing ads,['@psawers'],"May 2, 2023","Citymapper is lowering the paywall around its premium features and introducing a new subscription plan purely for removing ads. The move comes less than two months after the popular transit and travel planning app was scooped up by mobility tech company Via. London-based Citymapper, which gives city-dwellers real-time transport and routing information across hundreds of cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas, has dabbled with various ways of monetizing through the years, including through a paid bus service, multitransport transport subscriptions and an enterprise offering. Then back in September, the company launched a new subscription-based service that removed ads from the app and introduced a slew of premium features, including lock-screen navigation, bus-only routes and turn-by-turn voice navigation. Costing $2.99 a month or $19.99 a year, Citymapper Club, as the service is called, was evidently not enough to salvage the business as Via swooped in to buy the company six months later, in what was widely regarded as a fire sale (though no acquisition price was ever confirmed). Moving forward, all previous premium features will be free for all, with a new half-price $1.49 monthly fee ($9.99 per year) for those wanting to remove advertising. Citymapper premium features are now free. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Screenshot Citymapper premium features are now free. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Screenshot Acquiring the transit data of millions of urban travelers was clearly a big selling point for Via when it bought Citymapper, so it makes sense that it would look to encourage more usage by making all the features free to use. And by keeping an ad-free subscription in place, it allows the company to cover its costs and directly monetize a product that it now has to maintain alongside its existing properties. The premium features are available to all users via the latest Citymapper app update that quietly rolled out last week on Android and iOS. Some features are limited to a specific platform for now though, for example lock-screen navigation is only available on iOS, whereas a feature that shows you the best time to leave for your destination is limited to Android."
203,Wavelength is a new app trying to make group chat suck less,['@indianidle'],"April 20, 2023","There are billions of people using WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage or even Instagram for group chats. These platforms are ideally designed for “personal conversations” — more specifically individual chats. A new app called Wavelength wants to change that narrative by putting group chat on the front stage. The app is built by the makers of Telepath, a social network that debuted in 2020. But it never really took off as it was shut down last year. At the core, Wavelength — currently available on iOS and Mac to everyone — wants to solve the mess of traditional groups by creating threads for different conversations. In a typical WhatsApp or Telegram group, the chat is one-dimensional. All participants are sending messages to one giant river. So people can be talking about sports, politics and movies at the same time. The user is on their own when it comes to finding out the context for each of these topics and which message belongs to which subject. That’s why Wavelength puts an emphasis on threads. When you first start a group in the app, you also start the first thread when you type a message — even if the group just has two people. After that, other users can respond to that thread or create a new one. By default, after signing up you will see “groups” with contacts that are already using the app (those are auto-generated one-to-one groups) and a GPT 3.5-powered bot — more on that later. You can join a group through a public link or a friend can add you to a group. Image Credits: Wavelength Image Credits: Wavelength Users can simply get started by downloading the app and signing up with a phone number. But unless you already have some folks using the app, or have invites to some groups, starting out can be tough. There is no clear mechanism for group discoveries. You might have to hunt for groups on Twitter or Reddit, or ask folks you know to send you an invite or join you on the platform. The lists of groups and conversations look like an email inbox with a blue dot next to a group or thread when there is a new message. When entering a group, you’ll see a preview of the latest message to each thread (just like an email inbox). This design philosophy was suggested by John Gruber, who is now an advisor to the company behind the app. Prior to this Wavelength used to show preview cards for threads. The core team of Wavelength — CEO Richard Henry, CTO Riley Patterson and Chairman Marc Bodnick — talked to me in a group chat and explained how they came up with the idea of building the app. They said that Telepath wasn’t growing and the world was moving to private chats. So they shut down the social app in August 2022 and began working on Wavelength. A thread in Wavelength chat. Image Credits: Wavelength A thread in Wavelength chat. Image Credits: Wavelength “I had been thinking about the idea of threaded private chat going back to when we first started working on Telepath. When it was just Marc and I using the very first Telepath prototype, we used it for all kinds of conversations — naming the product, hiring our first engineer, chatting about dinner, etc. I remember thinking this is awesome, it’s basically a threaded private messaging app,” Henry said. “We considered just building private groups into Telepath as a feature, but we felt strongly that private chat needs strong end-to-end encryption, with messages stored on the device rather than in the cloud. So Wavelength needed to be a totally new product.” The team said that in today’s group chat, you can talk about only one thing at a time. It noted that people often just mute group chats because they don’t want to get notified about every conversation. But you might miss out on interesting conversations because you either mute everything or nothing. Developers said that using threads was the obvious solution. The startup released the closed beta of the product last summer and opened it up to a wider audience in March. For Wavelength, privacy is also a key feature. The app supports double ratchet end-to-end encryption for enhanced security. Users have to sign up on the app with a phone number, but the app doesn’t share it with anyone. Even when you join a group, the only thing you can see is the names of other members and not their contact details. Wavelength has end-to-end encryption for all chats. Image Credits: Wavelength Wavelength has end-to-end encryption for all chats. Image Credits: Wavelength When it comes to other apps that facilitate group chat, Telegram allows you to hide your phone number and display only your name or username. However, it’s important to remember that Telegram doesn’t have end-to-end encryption for group chats. Wavelength has also worked out encryption for historical messages. When a new member joins the group the app re-encrypts and securely shares recent message history so they can catch up. This is unlike WhatsApp, where you will only see messages after you joined a group. One of the things that stands out in Wavelength is its integration with a GPT-3.5-powered bot. You can have conversations with the bot about different kinds of things. But you can also call the bot to ask a question within a group conversation. This is helpful in a few ways. There’s the novelty factor of AI chatbots. With this feature, you don’t have to download a separate app or create an account on OpenAI just to try out an AI-powered bot. Plus, an AI bot can be useful in a group with your friends in a different way. For instance, you can ask for suggestions, such as recipes for a dinner party or a movie to watch on the weekend. Image Credits: Wavelength Image Credits: Wavelength The Wavelength team said that originally they didn’t plan to make a friends and AI app. But given the thread system in the app, AI can be a perfect companion. Mind you, AI can’t summarize the whole conversation for you as it only knows about messages it posted. This is due to the privacy-focused design of the app, as Wavelength doesn’t share your conversation with OpenAI — the company behind GPT. While the developers have found a unique way to tackle group messages, there are some challenges for the developers. As we mentioned above, group discovery is a huge friction point right now. Your friends won’t probably ditch WhatsApp or iMessage and switch to Wavelength. Moreover, a group app is only useful if your entire group of friends is using the app. While the app has been designed for private, invite-only groups, Wavelength can also facilitate semi-open big groups as well. The Wavelength team mentioned the group of Dithering podcast subscribers with thousands of members as an example — Dithering is a show by Gruber and Ben Thompson. Currently, there is a 10,000-member limit on groups. While Telegram offers 200,000 member group chats, Wavelength’s limits are still significant. There is also no thread search feature, which sometimes makes it difficult when you’re trying to look for older threads if several new threads have been created. That feature could also be used to look for an existing thread on the same topic. Philosophically, Wavelength lies in between Twitter, Reddit, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord and a good old discussion forum — all of which are trying to facilitate a conversation for a community or an interest group. It allows a group to chat with each other and breaks out the conversation into threads. In comparison, WhatsApp and Telegram have a linear chat mechanism — though Telegram allows commenting/threading on a message. A Discord server usually has channels for different subjects or topics, but it’s a rigid structure that doesn’t change very often. Twitter users only get a single feed by default and can create additional lists — but those are rarely shared. Reddit has a structured feed of posts for each subreddit with a conversation thread under each post. “Slack threads drive me crazy — the conversation usually starts in the channel, then someone spins it off into a thread, and then you’ve lost the first part of the conversation. So we wanted to build really intuitive threading, where you can’t screw it up,” Henry said. Wavelength is in the early stage of its lifespan. It doesn’t have feature parity with the likes of WhatsApp or Telegram. For instance, it doesn’t support reactions, GIFs or group calls. But the team is working on bringing some of those things. At the moment, there can only be one admin per group, which is fine for a group with a limited number of members but can be limiting for larger groups. The company is working on a few things at the moment: One of them is moderator tools like multi-admin for groups, thread pinning and the ability to define group rules. Plus, there is an Android version in the works, as the team said multiple people want to make groups with their friends regardless of what device they use. The Wavelength team added that it also has a roadmap with tons of AI features, but didn’t give any details. As for the business model, the company said it wants to keep Wavelength free for individual users. “We’ll never do ads — in addition to being terrible for privacy, they don’t work well in a messaging app anyway,” it said. To earn money, Wavelength plans to offer a pro version with more features along with a Wavelength for organizations that will be an alternative to something like Slack. But the team admits there is a long way to go before they can compete with the Salesforce-owned tool."
204,"Without the Stripe and OpenAI deals, global VC results would have been even worse in Q1 2023",['@alex'],"April 6, 2023","Even as Y Combinator reveals the latest startups in its cohort for this winter, we have poor news for founders: The global venture capital market shrank in Q1 2023, and it would have been even worse if it were not for a few mega deals, according to Crunchbase (disclosure: my former employer) and PitchBook reports. And here in the United States, things are looking grim. Startups are not the only ones suffering, either. Venture capitalists are also seeing their ability to fundraise being hampered as they digest a raft of mismarked startup deals from the last boom and a dearth of exit volume. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. This dip in funding for venture investors implies that the current startup investing downturn may not turn course anytime soon. The Exchange will have notes soon on what appears to be an expanding cohort of startups that may be the first companies to pursue IPOs when the market reopens. But for now, we’re stuck looking at money flowing into startup land, not the other way around.   There’s little good news to be found in this Q1 data, but don’t let that stress you. The numbers aren’t great, sure, but they’re also not quite as bad as we feared heading into 2023 last year. Onward! Crunchbase data indicates that total funding for startups in the first quarter globally fell to $76 billion from $162 billion from a year earlier. Given that the early 2022 months were not that far from the peak of the last startup cycle, this comparison is somewhat specious: We all know that things have slowed down since then. Zooming in, the total value of startup investment in Q1 2023 actually rose by 1% compared to Q4 2022, which is a more recent and therefore more useful comparison. Up is good, right? Why are we carping about declines if venture totals are no longer pointing toward the ground? Here’s how my longtime friend and former collaborator Gené Teare described the nuance in the first-quarter numbers, writing that the small gain in first-quarter dollar totals includes: “a reported $10 billion investment into OpenAI — largely from Microsoft — and a $6.5 billion round for payments giant Stripe. Without those two large deals, Q1 venture funding would have been down even more dramatically, close to $60 billion.”"
205,Twitter could be facing slew of fines in Germany over illegal hate speech,['@riptari'],"April 6, 2023","Elon Musk’s Twitter could be on the hook for a pipeline of multimillion-dollar penalties for failing to take down illegal hate speech in Germany. Fines could even stack up to billions if the federal government acts on the scores of cases of content moderation inaction that have already been reported to it and German courts confirm the law has been breached. Earlier this week, the federal government announced it was instigating a procedure over suspected systemic failures under the country’s hate speech takedowns law. The law, known colloquially as NetzDG, allows for fines of up to €50 million per case. The federal government is acting on just a handful of tweets out of hundreds that have been reported and collated in a database, per lawyer Chan-jo Jun, the founder and managing partner of the specialist IT law firm, JunIT Rechtsanwälte. Jun is representing the antisemitism commissioner of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg, Michael Blume, who he says has been targeted by abusive and defamatory tweets that Twitter has refused to take down. Some of the abusive tweets were posted by a Twitter user who had been banned before Musk took over the platform but had his account reinstated in Musk’s general amnesty on suspended accounts.   Late last year, the law firm went to court seeking an injunction against Twitter for failing to act on the reports to remove hate speech under the NetzDG law. The legal challenge succeeded in establishing the tweets were illegal. And it appears to have contributed to spurring the federal government into action — which, on Tuesday, said it had established “sufficient indications of failures” in Twitter’s complaint management processes to start a process that could result in the first penalty for a social media firm for failing to remove illegal content under NetzDG. Discussing the background to the case, Jun told TechCrunch his firm had reported a number of tweets to the Federal Justice Office (BfJ) last year but were initially told it did not have enough material to establish there was a systemic failure. “We had reported a number of cases to the [BfJ] at that time, and found that they agreed that these tweets were illegal but said they do not have enough material for a systematic failure. And that’s when a group of volunteers started to systematically search for illegal content and keep reporting that and making a huge database… and they kept submitting that to the [BfJ]. So it’s over 600 cases,” he said. “The ones that are now subject to the [federal government’s] case appear to be just the first ones. They picked them out because they were all similar in that way — I think they came from the same user and had the same content. That’s probably why they chose those because it would be the easiest case to see that is systematical failure. That it was not a single failure of one content moderator but actually that the vast majority — or all — of reports were wrongly handled.” Late last year, The New York Times reported on research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, the Anti-Defamation League and a number of other groups that study online platforms which found major increases in hate speech since Musk took over the platform at the end of October and set about slashing headcount — including cutting staff in Germany and other international offices. Concerns over Musk’s impact on Twitter’s content moderation in the region has also drawn shots from the EU’s executive, the European Commission, which will be taking up a major oversight role of larger platforms under the Digital Services Act later this year, which will set rules for how services must response to reports of illegal content. Internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, warned Musk last November the company has huge work ahead of it to comply with the incoming pan-EU rulebook — under which penalties for breaches can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover. So if Twitter isn’t bankrupt yet, under its erratic and heavily leveraged billionaire owner, it’s facing a cripplingly costly future if Musk keeps thumbing his nose at regulators and ignoring laws he doesn’t like. Even just in Germany if the BfJ were to act on the 600+ illegal hate speech cases that have already been reported to it that could sum to fines of up to €30 billion for Twitter, based on the maximum penalties set out in the NetzDG law. Of course a theoretical maximum outcome is unlikely. But there’s clearly no shortage of cases the BfJ could enforce — meaning fines for Musk-owned Twitter’s failures to purge hate speech could nonetheless quickly stack up. And Musk doesn’t have a limitless supply of legacy office furniture to sell to service his debts. Jun says he expects the first penalty on the tweets the BfJ has taken action on to be set below the maximum — assuming the court confirms they are illegal. “The law expects fines of up to €50 million for each case. It is possible that at first they will not take the full amount. There’s actually a table… that states the intensity of the failure. So I would expect something between €5M and €20M to be the first fine,” he suggests. “It will take a little longer time for it to go through the entire procedure because now it is up to the courts to decide if the contents are illegal or not. I’m pretty sure however, they are illegal because they have been subject to court decisions already.” “I had been putting pressure on the BfJ and the minister for the last seven months,” he adds. “And actually because I thought that the systematical failure had been obvious — with all kinds of crimes committed on Twitter, including child pornography, which also systematically was not taken down in the past. And the same is with most defamation cases — especially those where the legitimacy of a tweet cannot be judged by only the content of the tweet itself, where you have to explore what the truth actually is when defamation is being spread on Twitter. “And what we saw in the past is that Twitter decided not to take the effort of asking users to provide any proof for what they stay… even though this is being done by other social networks, such as Google, or [other social] networks in Germany.” No one would suggest that Twitter, pre-Musk, was doing a perfect job of content moderation. Far from it. And it remains curious that Germany has not pursued any social media firms for failing to comply with NetzDG’s content takedowns requirements up to now (after all, the law has been in force since 2017). But if Musk has done anything fast it’s scorch trust with regulators and lawmakers — by doing things like gutting resources for content moderation and sacking policy staff whose job it was to engage in dialogue with regulators over contested speech issues in order to press the company’s case — which means the institutions he loves to mock have little recourse but to assume the worst and just get on with applying the law. The BfJ was contacted for comment. Twitter’s press office auto-replied with a poop emoji in response to an emailed request for comment.    "
206,Software investors must (re)learn these 3 ideas before getting into deep tech,['@creative_vc'],"April 19, 2023","Last year, The Information proclaimed the software investing playbook has gone from an exclusive recipe amongst VCs to common knowledge amongst all investors. That, in addition to cheap money, has turned software investing into a low-margin finance game. Yet, traditional VCs are still stuck with their now low-margin businesses, unable to move forward and invest in the next big thing: deep tech. But perhaps that’s for the best. After all, unless software investors can unlearn their own playbook, they’ll continue struggling with the innovator dilemma while they slowly go extinct alongside the companies they’re so eager to fund. In other words, the software playbook is dead, not just doomed to fail. Here are three things software investors must relearn before investing in deep tech. Counting on one or two companies to return the entire fund is not only foolish, it’s a good indication of an investment team that shouldn’t be investing in deep tech. Software investors’ founder-first mantra is simply wrong in the world of deep tech. This type of magical thinking is exactly why their software playbook is doomed to fail. Deep tech takes decades to bear fruit, not years, and it is virtually impossible for deep tech companies to do a hard pivot. Expecting founders to overcome physical and technological constraints is downright bad investing, especially in an era where cheap money tends to evaporate. If you’re a software investor looking to invest in deep tech, you need to understand that the market is king here. A charismatic founder cannot be relied upon to “figure it out” along the way and a company’s team is only as good as its ability to exist inside its market. With pivots out the window, a deep tech company needs to get the market right from day one. A half-baked, superficial hypothesis about product-market fit and go-to-market strategy is child’s play in the world of deep tech."
207,"At just 2.1% of all VC investment, funding for women remains ‘meh’ in Q1 2023",['@dominicmadori'],"April 13, 2023","Things could’ve been worse, I guess. Companies with all female-founding teams raised about $800 million, or 2.1%, out of the estimated $37 billion invested in U.S. startups in Q1 2023, according to PitchBook. In dollar terms, that is a 53% year-over-year decline from the $1.7 billion all-female founding teams raised in Q1 2022. The decline isn’t a surprise. Venture and technology markets are not as confident as they have been in the past. A recession still looms, geopolitical upheaval continues and tech stocks aren’t faring well. When the economy is volatile, appetite for risk decreases, which impacts venture totals in general and certain founders in particular. Female founders, already seen as inherently riskier than male founders, are often overlooked, ignored and stored away until the next global social movement awakens everyone’s intention for good. Once again measured in dollars raised, mixed-gender teams also saw their venture totals decline on a year-over-year basis, raising $7 billion in Q1 2023. Last year, that cohort raised $15.8 billion. The dollar amounts, however, don’t tell the entire story. Though they raised less capital in the first quarter of 2023, mixed-gender teams are faring better than ever in terms of their share of all venture dollars, raising 18.9% of the capital invested thus far this year in U.S. startups. The past two years saw them raise an average 17.5% of total funding. As the year continues, this share will probably change for better or worse depending on the amount of capital invested in such teams and venture aggregates themselves. Tracking venture dollars raised is a useful metric, if an incomplete one. We also want to know how many deals were struck in total, and by whom. Here, the data may surprise."
208,3CX’s supply chain attack was caused by… another supply chain attack,['@carlypage_'],"April 20, 2023","The incident responders investigating how hackers carried out a complex supply-chain attack targeting enterprise phone provider 3CX say the company was compromised by another supply chain attack. 3CX, which develops a software-based phone system used by more than 600,000 organizations worldwide with more than 12 million active daily users, worked with cybersecurity company Mandiant to investigate the incident. In its report released on Thursday, Mandiant said that attackers compromised 3CX using a malware-laced version of the X_Trader financial software, developed by Trading Technologies. X_Trader was a platform used by traders to view real-time and historical markets, which Trading Technologies phased out in 2020, but Mandiant says was still available to download from the company’s website in 2022. Mandiant said it suspects the Trading Technologies website was compromised by a group of North Korea state-backed hackers, which it refers to as UNC4736. This is backed up by a report from Google’s Threat Analysis Group from last year, which confirmed that Trading Technologies’ website was compromised in February 2022 as part of a North Korean operation targeting dozens of cryptocurrency and fintech users. U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA says the hacking group has used its custom “AppleJeus” malware to steal cryptocurrency from victims in over 30 countries. Mandiant’s investigation found that a 3CX employee downloaded a tainted version of the X_Trader software in April 2022 from Trading Technologies’ website, which the hackers had digitally signed with the company’s then-valid code-signing certificate to make it look as if it was legitimate. Once installed, the software planted a backdoor on the employee’s device, giving the attackers full access to the compromised system. This access was then used to move laterally through 3CX’s network and, eventually, to compromise 3CX’s flagship desktop phone app to plant information-stealing malware inside their customers’ corporate networks. “This is notable to us because this is the first time we’ve ever found concrete evidence of a software supply chain attack leading to another supply chain attack,” said Mandiant’s chief technology officer Charles Carmakal. “This series of coupled supply-chain attacks just illustrates the increasing cyber offensive cyber capability by North Korean threat actors.” Mandiant says it notified Trading Technologies about the compromise on April 11 but says it’s not known how many users are affected. Trading Technologies spokesperson Ellen Resnick told TechCrunch that the company has not yet verified Mandiant’s findings, and reiterated that it stopped supporting the software in 2020.

And yet, a few companies have remained silent, including Apple and Meta. Today, the organization led by Mark Zuckerberg said that it aims to use generative AI in creating ads for different companies by the end of the year. In an interview with Nikkei Asia, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth, said the company expects to ship tools to create ads with AI that help a company make different images for different audiences. “[I] expect we’ll start seeing some of them [commercialization of the tech] this year. We just created a new team, the generative AI team, a couple of months ago; they are very busy. It’s probably the area that I’m spending the most time [in], as well as Mark Zuckerberg and [Chief Product Officer] Chris Cox,” Bosworth told the publication. In February, Zuckerberg announced a new team focusing on AI tools under CPO Chris Cox. The announcement noted that the company is experimenting with AI-powered chat on WhatsApp and Messenger along with filters for Instagram. While Meta’s metaverse efforts haven’t panned out as expected, it still seems to be pushing on the idea of creating virtual worlds through generative AI. Bosworth told Nikkei that large language models (LLMs) — like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s PaLM — will help with 3D model creation as you’ll just have to describe them. “So previously, if I wanted to create a 3D world, I needed to learn a lot of computer graphics and programming. In the future, you might be able to just describe the world you want to create and have the large language model generate that world for you. And so it makes things like content creation much more accessible to more people,” he said. While metaverse creation is on the company’s long-term plan, generating more ad revenue is probably the need of the hour. After Apple implemented its App Tracking Transparency feature in 2021, Meta was affected badly. Early last year, the social media company said that this change would cost them $10 billion in 2022. In February, during the Q4 2022 investors call, Zuckerberg said that “Our management theme for 2023 is the ‘Year of Efficiency’ and we’re focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.” So the company would want to find more avenues for earning money and generative AI seems to be its next bet. During the call, Meta also highlighted that despite the $1 billion annual revenue rate, Reels are not generating enough money. Meta is not the only company experimenting with generative ads though. Omneky, which presented at TechCrunch Disrupt last year, was using OpenAI’s DALLE-2 and GPT-3 to create campaigns. Movio, which is backed by IDG, Sequoia Capital China and Baidu Ventures, is using generative AI to create marketing videos.  "
210,How startups can produce social content that actually resonates,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 28, 2023","Social media can be a great tool for startups to gain visibility and garner a following among investors and customers, but coming up with a winning strategy may seem like a daunting task. Each platform mandates a different strategy and comes with its own set of guidelines. More importantly, each draws an audience specific to that channel. Content that wins on Twitter may not be as successful on Instagram or TikTok. Social media can be a hard place for startups operating with lean teams and resources. Even so, Redpoint head of content Rashad Assir thinks the potential rewards make it totally worth the grind. At TechCrunch’s Early Stage conference last week, Assir and Redpoint partner Josh Machiz said that the key to making content that will resonate on social media is making posts that feel authentic and target a niche audience."
211,Elon Musk reportedly settles defamation suit after saying he’d never ‘surrender an unjust case’,['@harriblogs'],"May 1, 2023"," A defamation case brought against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk by critic Randeep Hothi is coming to a close, reportedly costing the billionaire ten big ones.  Lawyers representing Hothi, a vocal member of the TSLAQ short-seller community on Twitter, said in a statement that Musk asked to settle the nearly three-year-old case back in March. Hothi tweeted on Monday that he accepted the alleged offer, “for a modest $10k.” The Tesla skeptic added that he “look[s] forward to receiving a check from him in the mail.” Hothi rose to prominence as a skeptic of Tesla’s gigafactory plans and “full self-driving” tech. In 2019, Tesla sought a permanent restraining order against Hothi, alleging he had “stalked, harassed, and endangered” employees while they were out driving in a Model 3. Additionally, Tesla said Hothi had trespassed on, and installed cameras around, its Fremont, California, facility. In response, a “defense fund” for Hothi on GoFundMe aimed to raise $100,000, and ultimately secured $229,592. Tesla soon dropped its case without publicly disclosing evidence to back up its claims. Yet, the saga took another turn about a month later, when Musk claimed in an email to another vocal critic of the company, Aaron Greenspan, that Hothi had “almost killed Tesla employees.” Greenspan published the CEO’s email, and Hothi later sued for defamation in the Alameda Superior Court of California. Hothi’s lawyers claimed that Musk’s comment “prompted an onslaught of hateful Twitter response,” saying the CEO’s supporters accused “Hothi of being a liar, a murderer, a terrorist, and a deranged maniac,” per an August 2020 complaint. Lawyers representing Musk petitioned the court to dismiss the case, but it ultimately moved forward to discovery. About a year ago, Musk tweeted that Tesla would “never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.” Hothi’s lawyers cited this tweet in a statement on Monday, saying, “We welcome Musk’s belated acknowledgment that this case was just.” Court docs show that Hothi’s lawyers filed a request earlier today to dismiss the case.

212,Daily.dev is like Reddit meets Stack Overflow,['@psawers'],"March 23, 2023","If Reddit and Stack Overflow were ever to create an offspring, it might look a little something like Daily.dev, perhaps with a little bit of Hacker News somewhere in the genetic makeup too. Founded out of Tel Aviv, Daily.dev wants to help like-minded software developers connect, share knowledge and discuss all that’s happening across their ecosystems. The three-year-old startup is today announcing its first institutional funding, securing an $11 million seed tranche from a slew of backers including lead investor Aleph, an early-stage VC firm that has previously backed the likes of WeWork, Lemonade and Houseparty. Daily.dev can be accessed through a number of channels, including a web app, Android, a progressive web app (PWA) and a browser extension. During the initial onboarding process, users are first asked to select topics that interest them — such as databases, developer tools or data science — and then they sign up using either their email address or credentials associated with Facebook, Google, GitHub or Apple. Daily.dev: Choose topics. Image Credits: TechCrunch / screenshot Daily.dev: Choose topics. Image Credits: TechCrunch / screenshot Users can then see a personalized feed based on their stated preferences, which might include how-to guides, news articles, questions and general discussions, or they can filter by the most popular posts. Anyone is free to bookmark threads, upvote posts of comments and kickstart their own conversations. Daily.dev “Most upvoted.” Image Credits: TechCrunch / screenshot Daily.dev “Most upvoted.” Image Credits: TechCrunch / screenshot Over time, users accumulate a “reputation” score based on their upvotes from the broader Daily.dev community. While this can serve as an at-a-glance indicator of trust, in time it will also be used to determine access to special privileges, though the company hasn’t yet announced what type of perks this will include. Image Credits: Daily.dev Image Credits: Daily.dev While this voting system is certainly reminiscent of something like Reddit or Stack Overflow, Daily.dev is notable in that there is no downvote button — a move partially designed to avoid the kind of toxicity and negativity that has plagued other similar online communities. “Establishing a healthy and sustainable community has to do a lot with managing emotions, negativity in particular,” Daily.dev co-founder and CEO Nimrod Kramer explained to TechCrunch. “So far, we haven’t built a downvote feature, mostly due to that logic.” However, it’s worth noting that users can still lose reputation points, for example if one of their posts is reported by other users and that post is banned by platform moderators. Kramer also said that they’re thinking about other ways to embrace the ethos of a downvote button without compromising the “healthy” vibes they’re trying to foster. “We are considering non-toxic ways to implement a new downvote mechanism to allow us to better personalize the platform, and also to let developers express criticism, without the potentially offensive implications,” he said. There’s no escaping the fact that there are plenty of developer-focused communities out their on the web, from Discord and Hacker News, to GitHub and Stack Overflow. So what, exactly, is Daily.dev hoping to bring to the mix? Kramer reckons that most of the incumbents are either too general or too focused on specific problems. “There’s a gap — when developers gather around general social platforms like Reddit, Discord and Twitter, the professional content they get is mixed with general content, marginalizing the domain-specific and highly-professional insights that fuel them,” Kramer said. “When they collaborate on developer platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow, the social experience they get is mostly siloed to specific repositories and Q&As. With Daily.dev, developers get a platform that’s built to their very specific preferences, values and language and offers a wide breadth of opportunities for learning, community and collaboration.” As a bonus, Daily.dev has made large chunks of its platform available on GitHub under an open source license, a move that’s common to many companies looking to ingratiate themselves with the software development fray. Developers love open source tools, as it allows them to tinker with the underlying technology and even contribute fresh code themselves. “We strategically decided to open source big parts of our code base to establish trust and transparency with our global developer community,” Kramer said. “It’s a win-win, because our users are developers. Being open source allows users to give feedback, contribute features, and fix bugs.” In terms of business model, Kramer said that Daily.dev currently makes money from tech companies running paid promotions on initiatives that might be of interest to developers, which for now translates into promoted discussions like this: Daily.dev Promoted posts and discussions. Image Credits: Daily.dev Daily.dev Promoted posts and discussions. Image Credits: Daily.dev As for its user base, Kramer said that Daily.dev has around 100,000 active daily users, including developers from all the big tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. Some 90% of these users also use the browser extension, according to Kramer, meaning they will see Daily.dev whenever they launch a new tab. While Daily.dev has grown over the past few years off the back of bootstrapping, its fresh $11 million cash injection will allow it to bolster the platform with new features. This includes something called “Daily.dev squads,” which are effectively private spaces for developer groups to coalesce. “This feature is currently in closed beta with several hundreds of our most active power users, and will be released publicly later this year,” Kramer said.  In the future, Daily.dev may also monetize through companies looking to foster relationships with developers, perhaps serving as a gateway to solicit feedback on new products, for example, or maybe even to recruit. “We see massive potential in the B2B space to enable meaningful, relevant communication between companies and developers,” Kramer said. “Tech companies are hungry for developer-specific audiences to engage with, whilst developers are looking for new solutions when brought to them relevantly and respectfully.” Although Daily.dev’s three co-founders (Kramer, Ido Shamun and Tsahi Matsliah) are all based out of Israel, the company says that it’s “remote native,” with 16 employees spread across seven countries. Aside from lead investor Aleph, other backers in Daily.dev’s seed round included Jibe Ventures, Secret Chord Ventures and a handful of angel investors."
213,"Cruise robotaxis are now operating everywhere, all at once in San Francisco (for employees)",['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 25, 2023","Cruise co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt said Tuesday that the company’s fleet of robotaxis are now operating 24 hours a day throughout all of San Francisco. And if you’re an employee, you can access it. The operational milestone comes a decade since Vogt and Dan Kan co-founded Cruise, which was acquired by GM in 2016. Like its previous rollouts, Cruise will first make this newly expanded service available to employees before opening it up to its so-called “power users” and then the general public.  Today, Cruise’s public service operates from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in neighborhoods on the northwest side of San Francisco. Power users, a higher designation given to public riders who provide regular feedback to Cruise, have an expanded service area at night and can also use the robotaxis during the day. Eventually, the 24-hour, go-anywhere service will be available to the public. Cruise did not share when that will be. Image Credits: Cruise Image Credits: Cruise In a thread on Twitter, Vogt said operating robotaxis in San Francisco “has become a litmus test for business viability. If it can work here, there’s little doubt it can work just about everywhere.” He added that full operations will soon open in other cities. “The capabilities and machine learning systems we’ve built to handle things in SF have proven themselves in many other cities around the world,” he wrote on Twitter. Notably, the self-driving system in the Cruise robotaxi, an autonomous version of the all-electric Chevy Bolt, is the same that will be in the custom-built Cruise Origin. The Cruise Origin, which was first unveiled as a prototype in January 2020, is now on public streets in Austin. For now, the Cruise Origin is being manually driven to map streets in preparation for autonomous testing later this year. On Tuesday, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said the automaker will stop producing its two top-selling EVs: the Chevy Bolt and its larger sibling, the Bolt EUV, by the end of 2023. GM later confirmed to TechCrunch that it will also stop producing the autonomous version of the Chevy Bolt at the end of the year. This means that Cruise will eventually have to phase out those vehicles. Although it doesn’t appear to be happening any time soon. Cruise is still scaling up its fleet of Chevy Bolt AVs as it expands its service area in San Francisco, Austin and Phoenix and eventually new cities, according to the company. Since last quarter, the company’s driverless fleet has increased by 86% from 130 to 242 concurrently operating AVs, according to Cruise. And more Bolts continue to join the fleet even as Cruise starts to introduce the Origin. Cruise said it will begin fixed-route testing of the Origin on public roads in Austin in the next few weeks. The company will continue to operate its public ride-hail service with Bolts, and eventually introduce Origins for both ride-hail and delivery alongside it."
214,Kid-focused short video app Zigazoo launches a TikTok competitor for Gen Z,['@laurenforristal'],"March 24, 2023","Zigazoo, the startup known for its TikTok-style video-sharing app for kids, is launching a separate app targeted at Gen Z users. The new app will take the flagship name and is meant for ages 13 and older, whereas the original kid-focused app is for Generation Alpha (3-12) and has been rebranded to “Zigazoo Kids.” Previous users in the younger age range will be automatically migrated to Zigazoo Kids. Zigazoo is invite-only and launches on Saturday, March 25. Like Zigazoo Kids, the new Gen Z-focused app is a video thread-style platform that doesn’t allow users to type comments on posts. Instead, users can only respond to each other via short-form videos, which the company believes reduces negative comments and trolling. Users can also answer video-driven prompts like, “What are your favorite sports?” or “What’s on your mind?” Image Credits: Zigazoo Image Credits: Zigazoo In addition to prohibiting negativity on the platform, the app includes other safety measures, such as optional private accounts, human-in-the-loop moderation and an algorithm that promotes positivity, the company said. However, unlike Zigazoo Kids, the Gen Z product doesn’t require parental consent and will have a direct messaging feature, which utilizes auto-moderation software. Meanwhile, TikTok has disabled direct messaging for users under 16 years old. From what we understand, however, TikTok only moderates messages that have been reported by users. Other new features available on the Gen Z app include searchable music and trending sounds, as well as allowing all users to make a “Vibe,” which is a video that users can respond to. On Zigazoo Kids, only verified creators and brands can make a Vibe video. To start, there will be a select group of creators on Zigazoo, including the cast of the Netflix reboot “That ‘90s Show,” an array of popular TikTokers like Hype House member Jack Wright, Alana Clements, and Nick Bencinvengo, as well as various Gen Z actors like “Girl Meets World” actress Ava Kolker and “Walker” star Kale Culley. The content ranges from dance and music to fashion, gaming, memes and more. Additionally, Zigazoo will launch entertainment channels where creators will lead the content. For instance, TikTok creator Hannah Kosh, known for her pop culture and celebrity gossip videos, will have a channel dedicated to entertainment news. Wright will also get a channel, as will Callie Haverda, who plays Leia Forman on “That ‘90s Show.” “I was drawn to Zigazoo because they are creating a positive community,” Haverda said in a statement. “I love the idea of being able to add organic content to a platform whose ultimate focus is to create a safe space for my generation. A big goal for me is to have fun and make entertaining art without the fear of negative comments or trolling, and Zigazoo provides just that! I’m so excited to be part of the initial launch, and can’t wait for you to see all the fun we have!” Image Credits: Zigazoo Image Credits: Zigazoo Zigazoo claims to provide a “nontoxic” environment for Gen Z consumers as many users become put off by other social media platforms where toxicity thrives, infested with unrealistic beauty standards, cyberbullying and content that may not be age-appropriate. According to a study by the consumer and business insights research group ORIGIN, 48% of Gen Z participants said social media makes them feel anxious, sad or depressed. Sixty-one percent of respondents admitted to doing a social media detox. So, launching a Gen Z-focused app in the current climate, especially given yesterday’s TikTok Congressional hearing, is certainly notable. While TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew tried to reassure representatives about the app’s impact on minors, referring to several features like the ineffective screen time controls, Chew was also clear on his stance that parents are mostly responsible for how their children use the app. Speaking with TechCrunch, Zigazoo co-founder Zak Ringelstein said, “We consider this moment a major social media reset, where obviously TikTok might get banned, but also Snapchat and Meta are suffering major losses. I think there’s a lot coming into view for everyone where maybe there should be a more critical eye [around social media], and there should be a place where people can go and feel good about themselves… We want to see a better social media, less toxic social media, and I think the time is really ripe for this moment. So we’re really excited about our launch.” Ringelstein added that another reason why Zigazoo saw an opening for the Gen Z app was that there are a ton of 12- to 14-year-olds (and older) already on Zigazoo Kids, making up about 31% of its users. “We decided to launch this new platform after seeing that so many Gen Z-ers, looking for a more positive and authentic social media environment, had already been organically migrating to Zigazoo. We wanted to create a social media oasis that was specially tailored for this audience,” he said. Zigazoo launched in 2020 as a “healthier” social media platform that lets kids browse or create 30-second videos based on challenges or educational prompts like, “Can you find something that’s symmetrical?” or “Can you teach us how to play your favorite sport or physical activity?” An adult must sign up for their child on Zigazoo Kids using either a Facebook, Google or Apple account. Parents decide if they want their kid’s videos to be published publicly or set to private. It’s also worth noting that Zigazoo Kids is kidSAFE COPPA certified. The company has raised a total of $20 million from big investors like Jimmy Kimmel, Serena Williams, Charli and Dixie D’Amelio, the NBA, as well as pocket.watch founder Chris M. Williams, MasterClass head of talent Matthew Rutler, and more. It’s also endorsed by celebrities like Christina Aguilera, LeBron James, Matt Damon and Dolly Parton. The app currently has over 3 million installs and more than 250 verified creators and brands, including Nickelodeon, Warner Bros., Paramount, Amazon, Apple TV+, Netflix, WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) and Mattel.

215,Big-time VCs link arms for climate coalition,['@harriblogs'],"April 25, 2023","About two-dozen venture capital firms say they are teaming up to “build a robust movement” in the VC business to combat the climate crisis. The group calls itself the Venture Climate Alliance, or VCA. The coalition counts well-known tech investors, including Tiger Global and Union Square Ventures as members, and said in a joint statement on Tuesday that its goal is to “define, facilitate, and realize net zero-aligned pathways” for early-stage startups. Several things are happening here. Materially, VCA says its members will kick things off by assessing their “scope 1-3 carbon footprint,” and by pledging to hit “net zero or negative emissions for their own firm’s operations” by the end of the decade. VCA also says its members are committed to helping their portfolio companies set net-zero targets for 2050 at the latest. Along the way, members are supposed to “report transparently on their progress over time.” Crucially, “net-zero emissions” are not the same as zero emissions, and businesses have earned scrutiny for using such language to obscure their ongoing carbon pollution. Net-zero targets that hinge on carbon offsets warrant skepticism, given the offset industry’s poor track record to date. The makeup of VCA is also noteworthy. Several well-known generalists are linking with some relatively specialized firms, such as S2G, a prolific food tech backer, and Fifth Wall, which focuses on real estate and runs a hefty, buildings-focused climate fund. In theory, VCA members can share a nice, big Rolodex of experts and pass on what they learn across industry lines.  Directionally, VCA is a signal from noteworthy investors that they’re still invested in climate solutions, be they “climate tech” or broader decarbonization efforts. This is important because, after two blowout years, funding for climate tech ebbed in the first quarter of 2023, sowing doubt as to whether the sector is still as trendy or “recession proof” as it seemed. In an email to TechCrunch, climate finance consultant Dan Firger said VCA’s methodology working group will start developing a list of best practices and disclosure guidelines in May. “We anticipate sharing more information with members, and the public, along the way,” he added. VCA membership isn’t binding and members can leave “at any time,” said Firger. Membership also isn’t limited to the 23 venture firms that are currently on board. The group said in a statement that it is open to any venture firm that “agrees to fulfill VCA’s commitments and to actively contribute to the organization.” Other members at launch include Obvious, DCVC, Prelude and Clean Energy Ventures. This story was updated at 7:28pm PT on April 25 to reflect that Kleiner Perkins is not involved with the VCA. A representative for VCA said the firm was “erroneously included” in an earlier press release."
216,Unpicking the rules shaping generative AI,['@riptari'],"April 13, 2023","In the past couple of weeks, already an ice age ago in AI hype terms, a number of very well known names in tech (Elon Musk! Woz!) signed an open letter calling for a halt on the development of AI models more powerful than OpenAI-s GPT-4 — arguing humanity needs time for planning and management around the application of powerful automation technologies which they implied could be on the cusp of toppling man from his pinnacle atop the proverbial food chain. Whether their call for human civilization to buy time to adapt to “ever more powerful digital minds”, as they put it — and beat the digital genii back into the bottle by somehow collectively agreeing “shared safety protocols” and “robust AI governance systems” — was more a self-interested bid by a subsection of technologists to throw a spanner in the engine of more advanced competitors (so they can try to catch up) is one overarching question. But the letter’s implication that no laws apply to AI is just obviously wrong. Although we can certainly argue how existing laws apply (or should be being applied). Below, we’ve compiled an overview of some of the main areas where laws are already being flexed and tested in response to generative AI’s fast-scaling automated outputs — and for sure it’s a patchwork, not the kind of aligned (global?) governance the letter claims to be agitating for. We also discuss incoming rules that are set to put bespoke guardrails around applications of AI in the coming months and years. When it comes to dedicated legislation for AI, U.S. lawmakers are still debating what to do. It’s China and Europe that are fastest to the punch here. But while the Chinese state is moving to control and censor how AI can be used, EU lawmakers see risk-based regulation as key to fostering consumer trust and uptake of the tech — via a claim of safeguards for fundamental rights. On the flip side, countries like the U.K. and India are running in the opposite direction, with no plan to apply fixed rules to AI at this stage — apparently planning to let the tech rip in the hopes it sparks a homegrown high tech boom they can ride to economic glory. So quite the spread of high-level bets are being made. And the prospect of a unified/universal approach looks fanciful, to put it politely. Last month, Italy’s data protection authority grabbed the world’s attention by ordering OpenAI to stop processing locals’ data for its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot. It said it was concerned the company is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — in areas like the lawfulness and transparency of the processing, provision of data access controls and protections for minors. OpenAI responded almost immediately by geoblocking its ChatGPT service to Italian IP addresses. Although the action does not address the regulator’s key concern that its AI model was trained on the personal information of Italians without a proper legal basis. To stop processing that data OpenAI would have to retrain its model with the offending personal data of Italians stripped out (meaning it would likely need to switch off its whole service while it did that). None of which it has done. Instead, it said believes it complies with all privacy laws — setting itself up for a fight with the European Union’s data protection regulators which are more numerous than the EU has Member States. The Italian DPA followed up this week with a fresh order telling OpenAI what it needs to do to get the suspension lifted by the end of this month. But the to-do list is a long one: Including opening up about its processing; applying age gating and later verification tech; rethinking the legal basis it claims for processing; and providing ways for Europeans to ask for corrections or have their data deleted if ChatGPT generates false information about them, as the bot is prone to. How feasible some of these asks are given the nature of machine learning technology is up for debate. And OpenAI has just a couple of weeks to make most of the changes. (Reminder: Penalties under the GDPR can scale up to 4% of global annual turnover.) So the GDPR does indeed look like a legal nightmare for chatbot/large language model (LLM) makers like OpenAI which have relied upon hoovering up vast amounts of public (but sometimes personal) data to train their models without, apparently, a thought for EU data protection laws. There are a raft of instructive GDPR enforcements already when it comes to scraping personal data off the public Internet to train AI models: Controversial facial recognition firm, Clearview AI, has been issued with multi-million dollar fines and orders to delete data right across the EU — from Italy and France to Greece and the U.K. — which, even if local DPAs have a hard time collecting fines from an uncooperative US-based company, at least limits its ability to operate a service in the region since regulators can (and have) chase local users to shut down that business. Basically, if you’re touching personal data in the EU you need a valid legal basis for that processing. The GDPR allows for a number of possible grounds but most aren’t going to be applicable to commercial generative AI — per the Italian DPA just two are theoretically possible in the case of ChatGPT (consent or legitimate interests). But asking users to consent to use of their data for training AI models etc seems unlikely to scale, given the vast amounts of data being sucked in. (And few, if any, AI model makers have been asking permission to grab people’s info as training data so far.) The makers of generative AI services, perhaps especially large language models (LLMs), thus face a particular challenge to ensure they’re not in breach of GDPR lawfulness of processing requirements. At the very least they need to be upfront about how they’re processing people’s data. But explaining how AI works is itself a challenge. So whether they can even do that to the required level of detail is an open question. The GDPR requires not only a legal basis for any personal data ingested but that the data processor informs people what they’re doing with it — to avoid breaching the regulation’s transparency, fairness and accountability principles. (And let’s just say OpenAI’s recent public missive, re its “approach to AI safety“, does not provide a comprehensive view on how its using people’s data; a section in it, entitled “respecting privacy”, sums to a claim of ‘trust us with your info’ — which certainly won’t pass muster with EU regulators.) If generative AI model makers want to avoid many more stop-processing orders flowing in the EU (other DPAs are reportedly eyeing action after the Italians stepped in) — not to mention the risk of millions of dollars in fines — they’re going to need to be a lot more open than OpenAI has been so far. Speaking to TechCrunch ahead of the Italian DPA’s intervention, Dr. Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, VP of global privacy for the Future of Privacy forum, essentially predicted what was about to unfold — suggesting DPAs would play an active role in ordering AI developers to open up about how they’re using personal data. EU watchdogs could act on their duty to enforce the GDPR by issuing orders to providers of LLMs like ChatGPT to “be transparent about the exact data that they use about a certain uniquely identifiable person on the internet”, she said, adding “let’s see” — just a few days ahead of the prediction coming true. “You have to provide transparency into what data you’re collecting. And if those obligations are not met, you are not complying with one of the fundamental principles in Article 5(1A) — lawfulness, fairness and transparency,” she also told us. “If anything that you do touches personal data, and especially if it’s automated, you have to comply with [the GDPR]. And if it’s a lot of sensitive data — or you have a new method to process data — you need those data protection impact assessments that have specific requirements if you want to do the right. You have the data protection by design obligations. But it’s also a matter of needing to be serious about complying with it. But it doesn’t have thresholds in application — it’s just immediately triggered, whenever personal data is touch, is made available.” The GDPR also gives individuals a suite of data access rights, meaning people in the EU can ask for a copy of info about them that’s been processed; ask for corrections of erroneous data; and even request their data is deleted. But at the time of writing there’s no established way to make such asks set up by OpenAI — such as a formal reporting system to deleting data from ChatGPT. The lack of a formal tool should not, in itself, be a block to users asking to exercise their rights (they could, for example, send a SAR by email; provided they can find an email address for OpenAI). But the company does not appear to be prepared to deal with an influx of personal data requests. Plus, evidently, the Italian DPA takes the view that it should be facilitating these asks — by providing systems for people to exercise their data access rights. In its blog post, OpenAI claims it responds to “requests from individuals to delete their personal information from our systems”. However there is no confirmation it has responded to what are known as Subject Access Requests (SARs) as yet — and it is certainly receiving such requests in the EU. So this issue won’t be going away. As the Italian Garante’s intervention suggests, the lack of formal reporting systems attached to generative AI technologies like ChatGPT is likely to need to change — at least for any AI services that operate in the EU — but one question is how can the developers of AI models respond to these kind of individual requests? And whether they will really commit to removing personal data from their training pool — so, essentially, commit to retraining their models on demand, every time an EU user asks for their info to be deleted or rectified. (Or will they instead seek to avoid being subject to that level of individual control by bringing in a bunch of lawyers to argue against such an interpretation and application of the law, as Big Tech historically has vis-à-vis GDPR enforcement?) The EU’s privacy regulation takes a broad view on what personal data is. But machine learning systems certainly complicate the picture for regulators by using information as a training resource to build models that can then generate new types of data — drawing on inputs in ways AI makers can’t always explain. Additionally, generative AI models have, at times, been shown reconstructing training data in their outputs — raising the spectre of personal data literally being breached in the process. (And data breaches are certainly regulated under the GDPR.) At the same time, there is a question mark over how the EU’s comprehensive data protection framework can be applied to technologies like LLMs in practice — and even whether, as one legal expert we talked to recently suggested, the technology might have broken EU law in a more fundamental way by undoing the data controller/processor and data subject model it established for protecting people’s data. The framework predates the kind of massive data-mining involved in training general purpose AIs such as LLMs (NB: The GDPR has only been in force since 2018 but principles it builds on were set out far earlier, in the Data Protection Directive — a piece of legislation the EU passed in the mid nineties). Given the complexity inherent to AI, there may very well be caution among some EU DPAs about how they approach regulating the tech — to avoid being accused of overstepping the mark by applying the GDPR in ways the lawmakers who drafted the framework did not intend. One thing to consider on the lawfulness of processing point OpenAI is now having to wrangle with in Italy, is if Google and other search engines can get away with scraping people’s data without up-front permission, under their claim of (usefully) organizing the world’s information, why can’t generative AI model makers? The answer to that will likely hinge on nuanced detail — like how much transparency is being provided into what’s being done with the data. (And, indeed, on Google bowing to the EU’s right to be forgotten ruling by providing systems for private individuals to request irrelevant data be de-indexed — something that looks a lot more complex for LLMs to pull off.) Elsewhere, where the GDPR is concerned, child protection is emerging as a strong motivating force for the bloc’s privacy regulators to step in. Following the Italian DPA’s intervention, OpenAI noted that it is “looking into verification options” to address safety concerns attached to minors’ information and access to the tech — so some form of age verification looks set to be one concrete early result of GDPR enforcement in the EU. It remains to be seen whether OpenAI will limit any age gating to just Italy or push it out across the bloc or indeed elsewhere. (Another instructive intervention here is the Garante’s recent stop-data-processing order to AI chatbot maker Replika — also citing risks to children.) That’s not all where the GDPR is concerned; there’s also the question of whether LLMs may be taking solely automated decisions with significant impacts on individuals — which will really depend on how generative AI is being applied (and probably isn’t an issue for general purpose platforms). But, if so, it would trigger a regional right for individuals having information on the logic of those decisions. And, potentially, the right to ask for a human review. “All of these safeguards [in the GDPR] that are around automated decision making might also be an avenue where data protection authorities can look and that will require increased transparency,” suggests Zanfir-Fortuna. “That could require an avenue for the individual to challenge the outcome of this automated process.” With DPAs across the bloc faced with tricky decisions on whether/how to enforce the GDPR atop technologies which are being adopted at lightning speed, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body for applying the GDPR consistently, may well play a key role in shaping how regulators approach generative AI. This week Spain’s data protection regulator, the AEPD, told TechCrunch it has asked for ChatGPT to be included in the next plenary meeting — “so that harmonised actions can be implemented within the framework of the application of the GDPR”. And today Reuters reported that the Board has formed a task force to support regulators on possible enforcements. So moves are afoot to try and harmonize how EU regulators respond. The Board has been playing an increasingly important role in the enforcement of the GDPR in cross-border cases against tech giants — settling disputes between DPAs on a number of cases against Meta and others. So it may well need to take the final word on any generative AI disputes. Although, in the case of OpenAI, since the company has not established a base in the EU, it’s facing local enforcement of the GDPR — wherever and whenever regulators have concerns — rather than being subject to a (typically far slower) cross-border enforcement process in which complaints are funnelled via a single lead regulator and final enforcement must wait until agreement is reached between all interested regulators. Which can take years vs Italy’s Garante spinning up an intervention within a few months of ChatGPT hype going crazy. Beyond the EU, Canada’s privacy watchdog also recently stepped in to announce a probe of ChatGPT — acting on a complaint alleging the collection, use and disclosure of personal information without consent. And it’s worth noting that while the EU is the most advanced region in regulating privacy and data protection, it is not alone in having an established system of legal protections for people’s information. Indeed, the GDPR has proven to be an inspiring template for lawmakers around the world (see, for e.g., Brazil). Nor, therefore, is Europe alone in considering how privacy rules should be applied to generative AI right now. If you thought the EU has enough digital regulations already, think again! At the time of writing, EU lawmakers are at an advanced stage of three-way negotiations to hammer out agreement on a risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence. This follows a draft proposal by the European Commission back in April 2021. The basic approach for the EU’s AI Act is to categorize use-cases of artificial intelligence as either (in a very few cases) prohibited; high risk; or low risk — with the ‘high risk’ category (examples include AI being used in fields like employment, law enforcement, justice, education, healthcare etc) being subject to regulatory requirements in areas like data quality and security and avoiding bias, both ex ante (before) and ex post (after) launching into the market. While AI apps that are classed as low risk (the vast majority of use-cases) are merely encouraged to apply best practices codes of conduct — so essentially left to regulate themselves. Very few use-cases are out-and-out prohibited under the plan (Chinese style social credit scoring is one.) Although discussions to agree all the details of the planned law continue.  The initial Commission proposal also contained some transparency requirements for technologies such as chatbots and deepfakes — requiring that users of such services are clearly informed they’re interacting with a machine. However the draft proposal did not explicitly tackle general purpose AIs (aka GPAIs) or what are sometimes couched as “foundational models”. So there’s been concern about a loophole based on makers of GPAIs technically falling outside the listed high risk categories, given their technology is framed as multi-purpose, which could let them claim the law doesn’t apply to them — pushing all the regulatory risk onto downstream AI deployers (such as businesses plugging into their APIs). It’s certainly notable OpenAI has moved so quickly to platformize ChatGPT — opening up the technology to business users to plug directly into their apps — so it’s clear that any risks associated with usage of generative AI technologies will quickly be massively distributed and embedded wherever the technology is being used. And that looks set to be a truly huge surface area. Which in turn means AI regulations that don’t tackle GPAIs head on risk being out-of-date before they’ve even hit the books. Luckily for the EU, peak (?) hype around generative AI developments has coincided with negotiations towards agreeing a final text for the AI Act — giving lawmakers a chance to propose amendments aimed at plugging the GPAI gap and ensuring the likes of ChatGPT will be covered. Last month, Euractiv reported on proposals put forward by the European Parliament’s co-rapporteurs on the AI file to apply significant obligations to GPAI makers like OpenAI — akin to those the draft applied to high risk systems; including risk-management obligations around system design and testing; and data governance requirements for training data-sets. Additionally, it reported the suggested amendment would require technologies like ChatGPT to undergo external audits — to “test performance, predictability, interpretability, corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity in line with the AI Act’s strictest requirements”. It’s still not clear how exactly the EU will seek to regulate general purpose AIs because we won’t know that until the Parliament and Council reach final agreement in closed-door trilogue discussions. (And AI firms like Microsoft, a major investors in OpenAI, have — in the meanwhile — been lobbying for a GPAI carve out.) But it seems highly likely the framework will be amended to at least take account of ChatGPT and its ilk, given how blisteringly fast these technologies are making a mark. “I think it’s going to have to be… a bit of a pick and mix,” suggests internet law expert Lilian Edwards, a professor at Newcastle University, discussing where the AI Act amendments might end up on GPAIs. “They can’t just say all general purpose AI top level is high risk. It just won’t play, which is what European parliament have said. And they can’t just try and throw it on to the downstream developers, deployers, which is pretty much what the council has said, because that is obviously unfair. It obviously let’s OpenAI off the hook, etc.” “It’s quite likely… that we’re going to have some interim regime,” she goes on, sketching a possible compromise whereby responsibilities for different risk-related issues are shared or jointly applied — such as by requiring GPAI model maker to tackle data quality (i.e. fix issues like bias in the training data), since the deployer has no access to the training data, with other responsibilities perhaps pushed on to the deployer since they’re attached to a specific use of the technology which the maker of the foundational model is not directly involved with. “It might be that we distribute the risks and the responsibilities along the AI value chain… [but] keep the data quality requirements at top level for for the providers,” she suggests. “There’s various axes of argument. There’s not just are they high risk and what responsibilities would that have with it? And when are they high risk? And is it shared with downstream deployers? So that’s kind of like your GDPR situation — where we have this development in adtech having joint controllers who have responsibilities for the personal data at different points in the horrible process of ad personalization. “So I think we’re maybe heading towards that kind of world. Which everyone will hate. Everyone. Because it’s so unclear. And it will lead to lots of court cases, I would have thought — which again you wouldn’t have thought was what anybody wants. So I guess [joining the dots]… this is obviously going to be controlled by contract. You know, when you buy the upstream GPT-7, whatever it is, to put it into your system one of the terms of the contract will be either that you indemnify or you take on all the risks.” Edwards notes other recent proposed amendments to the AI Act targeting unfair contractual terms which she suggests are motivated by this line of thought. If correct, future regulation of GPAIs under the EU’s AI Act could boil down to what’s contained in small print terms. (And we all know how users tend to gloss over T&Cs to more quickly get their hands on ‘free’ tech. So it’s not a great prospect.) Reached last week, the office of co-rapporteur and MEP, Dragos Tudorache, confirmed they are “still working on the compromises that have to do with GPAI”. Asked if the likely outcome will be responsibility for risks being split between GPAI model makers and deployers of their technology, perhaps combined with rules to guard against unfair contract terms being imposed by the former on the latter to try to outsource regulatory risk, the spokesperson told us: “We’re discussing the compromise on GPAI as we speak — we will have a more stable text in a couple of weeks. “As of now, indeed we are trying to make sure that the value chain is adequately and fairly covered — that is, providers of foundational models do have some responsibilities towards downstream providers and providers in turn do have some responsibilities towards deployers. We do indeed have a section on unfair contractual terms — modelled after the discussions in the Data Act — to prevent the scenario you are mentioning.” As it happens, Edwards has been working on a research project looking at T&Cs of LLMs and generative AI platforms. The project isn’t finished yet but her early observations are that most terms aren’t tailored to the specific service/uses of the AI tech, with gaps for instance around areas like training data. So the suggestion is there’s a lot of copypasta lurking down there on generative AI apps and the business end of this ‘AI value chain’ may not sum to the kind of meaningful disclosures lawmakers are hoping for. (So, basically, more compliance theatre. Lawyers rejoice!) “I would bet my bottom dollar actually that we’ll find that throughout — that these are very boilerplate terms and conditions,” she suggests. “Except for the ones from [major players] like OpenAI, where the you know, they’ll be paying lawyers the big bucks. But for all the small downstream deployers I bet the terms and conditions are really, really boilerplate and don’t refer to any issues you might like to be clarified.” It’s worth noting that, from a consumer perspective, T&Cs are already regulated in the EU, via the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. So EU lawmakers may be anticipating those rules will apply to generative AI services which are providing a service to consumers — putting some limits on the conditions they can unilaterally impose on users. (But, again, that’s assuming users even read T&Cs and/or know to call out unfair terms.) The enforcement question certainly looms large over the EU AI Act, even while the detail is still being debated. And, clearly, paper rules are only as good as action that backs them up so having a legal framework is just a first step. It’ll be how — or whether — it gets enforced that really counts. And that remains a challenge for future years. That said, the EU does have a draft plan on the table to expand liability protections to AI and software — so it’s  fashioning both fixed rules for riskier applications of AI combined with the threat of lawsuits for model makers that fail to ensure their products don’t scale harms. (And not just physical harms either: The liability framework proposal aims to encompass breaches of fundamental rights, too.) So, again, litigation may have a key role in shaping practical guardrails for AIs.   Generative AI services operating in China are already subject to an expanding set of rules that put restrictions on the use of the tech for activities that could endanger national security, damage public interest or are otherwise illegal — relying on the Chinese Internet’s real-name verification apparatus to enforce surveillance and censorship on AI users. The Chinese state has sought to impose restrictions on generative algorithms since passing a law in December. Under the regime, AI services are required to verify the identity of users and report violations — enabling a system of state-mandated control on the tech’s inputs and outputs. Service providers must also audit AI-generated content and user prompts — which has led to early generative AI offerings that filter politically sensitive content.  The state’s AI regulation also bakes in a requirement that platforms seek permission to alter others’ faces and voices via deep synthesis; and watermark AI-generated content if there’s a risk it could be misconstrued by the public, with — also — a general ban on using generative AI to generate disinformation. Add to that, China passed its own comprehensive data protection regulation, back in August 2021, and AI developers and deployers are required to comply with that rulebook if they’re processing personal data. There’s more coming too: Just this week, the state Internet regulator revealed additional draft rules for AI, slated to be passed later this year, including a requirement for algorithms to be registered with the authorities. Under the expanded proposal, providers of generative AI services must apply a range of prohibitions on what their tech can produce — with the rules banning content that subverts government power and authority or questions national unity, for example, along with bans on objectionable content such as ethnic discrimination and terrorism. So the censorship looks to be dialling up. China is clearly wasting no time in establishing a framework to control this powerful new iteration of automation tech, even as internet tech giants compete to roll out their own ChatGPT competitors. One question that arises is whether the level of control and surveillance being sought by the Chinese Communist Party over generative AI inputs and outputs ends up having a chilling effect on local tech giant’s ability to develop competitive systems. Western companies, including the U.S. AI giants leading the charge, face a far lighter level of regulation that may help them innovate more quickly and win the metaphorical ‘AI arms race’ while Chinese tech giants are grappling with layers of state-imposed red tape.   While much is still to be firmed up re: the EU’s incoming AI rules, the bloc remains strides ahead of other Western democracies on grappling with how to regulate artificial intelligence — thanks to its decision to prioritize rule-making for “trustworthy and human” AI several years ago. But, over in the US, lawmakers are considering what an “accountability mechanism” for “trustworthy AI” might look like — echoing some of the language the EU used when lawmakers were drafting their own risk-based approach to AI. The discussion sounds familiar: With U.S. policymakers talking about the need for “responsible AI” which considers risks in areas like privacy, security, bias and so on.  “We are still in the early days of the development of these systems… It’s clear they are going to be game-changing across many sectors… But it also becoming clear that there’s cause for concern about the consequences and potential harms from AI system use,” said Alan Davidson, the assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information, earlier this week — announcing a government inquiry on how to guarantee trust and accountability in AI systems. “There are risks — risks to privacy, security and safety, potential bias and discrimination. Risks to trust and democracy and implications for our jobs, economy and the future of work.” The latest effort builds on earlier steps, such as work done around auditing AI and an “AI Bill of Rights” the White House produced last year. However those recommendations for privacy protections, safety measures and checks against discrimination were still voluntary. So it’s a far cry from drafting a legislative framework. And the Biden administration’s policy moves in this area remain in an early, consultatory stage — lagging far behind tech developments. (Plus, of course, with a U.S. presidential election looming next year there’s little time for the current government to set ‘Made in America’ guardrails for generative AI. Any such effort would presumably have to wait for a second Biden term.) The U.K. government, meanwhile, recently confirmed it will eschew setting any fixed rules for applying AI for the foreseeable future — outlining a light touch regime in a white paper last month, accompanied by loud rhetoric about wanting to fire up economic growth via AI innovation. Under the plan, it will expect existing (overburdened) regulators to produce sectoral guidance for AI, with no more money (nor powers) to compel model makers to implement recommendations. So, basically, no rules; just ‘take a risk’ self regulation. The U.K. is also in the process of watering down the domestic data protection regime. (But — just to throw a curve ball — the government has also drafted sweeping Internet content regulations, aka the Online Safety Bill, under which platforms will face amped up pressure to tackle illegal content, including deepfake porn shared without consent which is set to be criminalized.) India has taken a similar tack to the U.K. on stepping away from dedicated AI regs, recently signalling it won’t be rushing to regulate generative AI — as says it sees the sector as a “significant and strategic” area for the nation; (and even a “kinetic enabler of the digital economy and innovation ecosystem” as the IT ministry put it in perfect tech buzzword bingo). The EU’s risk-based framework for AI may therefore set the de facto regional (and even global) standard — certainly for any U.K. businesses wanting help with how to approach liability and the ability to scale usage of their products across the bloc. Fines for breaching the AI Act’s high risk provisions were proposed by the Commission at up to 4% of global annual turnover (or €20M, whichever is greater). But enforcement atop complex learning technologies is, clearly, a vast, new intricate challenge. And it will be years before anyone gets to measure how policymakers have performed.  Still, the EU’s AI Act could help clear up one grey area in relation to generative AIs trained on data processed without a lawful basis under the GDPR: The proposal may contain powers for regulators to order non-compliant models destroyed — whereas it’s less certain the EU’s data protection rulebook empowers DPAs to order an AI model’s complete destruction in such a scenario (vs the more bounded ask that unlawfully processed personal data is deleted, which risks leaving the model itself untouched). As if that wasn’t enough, the European Union has (yet) more digital rules landing shortly — having completed a major ecommerce services and platform update last year which is coming into application this year and next: Aka the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). The pair of regulations apply to digital services, marketplaces and platforms (in the case of the DSA); and to a subset of intermediating/overbearing tech giants which get designated as running “core platform services” (DMA). Neither of these laws will apply directly to makers of generative AI tools, according to the European Commission — at least not yet. Or that’s what the EU’s executive told us when we asked. But a spokesperson suggested they may apply indirectly, i.e. if regulated platforms and core platform services are making use of generative AI technology. This is because, in the case of the DSA, algorithmic systems are in scope of the risk assessment and audit requirements for so-called very large online platforms or search engines (aka VLOPs/VLOSE).  And here again LLMs’ tendency to make stuff up (hallucination/disinformation) could create regulatory risks for larger platforms that opt to embed generative AI services. “Both the DSA and DMA will apply to respective entities in scope and the latter may use algorithmic systems such as (but not exclusively) Large Language Models (LLMs),” a Commission spokesperson told us, noting that the DSA defines a platform as “a hosting service that, at the request of a recipient of the service, stores and disseminates information to the public, unless that activity is a minor and purely ancillary feature of another service“. “The plug-ins functionality do not change the statu[s] of ChatGPT, if there is no hosting, storing or dissemination of information to the public on the request of the recipient of the service,” they went on. “Where a LLM is integrated into another service, this could potentially bring the LLM into scope of the DSA where it forms part of a regulated service under the DSA. This would cover in particular the risks linked to inauthentic use and automatic exploitation. “The algorithmic systems used by VLOPs/VLOSEs will be subject to specific rules, irrespective of what technologies they use. Notably, companies eventually designated as VLOPs and VLOSEs are expected to conduct a risk assessment under Art.34 of the DSA which covers algorithmic systems. Such systems would also be subject to audit under Art.37.” “As part of the ongoing implementation of the DSA and DMA, the Commission services continuously monitor all technological developments and innovative online services. Ensuring that these two pieces of legislation are future-proof has been a key objective of the Commission throughout the process of writing the proposal, and assisting in the negotiations. At this stage, we are not in a position to comment on any specific company or service,” the spokesperson added. The DMA, an ex ante competition reboot aimed squarely at (pre-generative AI boom) tech giants like Google, defines just ten core platform services types, including online search engines and web browsers, that can be designated as “gatekeepers” (i.e. subject to the regulation) — if the companies providing the services meet certain quantitative thresholds, including turnover, market capitalisation, geographical scope and size of user base. LLMs are not currently listed as a core platform service so can’t be designated gatekeepers under the DMA. But the Commission made a point of noting that this list “could be extended in the future following a market investigation, should [we] find that new services display features of weak contestability or systemic unfair practices”. So it will, presumably, be keeping a weather eye on developments in generative AI.  “While LLMs are not as such on the list of core platform services in the DMA, it seems likely that LLMs could be used to support individual core platform services provided by gatekeepers,” the Commission spokesperson also told us — suggesting requirements may again be applied indirectly, i.e. via obligations placed on gatekeepers which find themselves subject to the regulation’s list of ‘dos and don’ts’. Or, put another way, if a gatekeeper tries to extend the market power of an existing core platform service (e.g. Internet search) through LLM technology (say Google’s Bard or Microsoft’s New Bing) their application of this powerful new form of automation could in theory be subject to DMA rules. Say, for example, the regulation’s ban on gatekeepers self preferencing in search results. Which could mean they face an up-front ban on deploying biased search-with-AI chatbots that always recommendations their own products. (Albeit that would obviously he a dumb and anti-competition trick for either to try pulling off so seems pretty unlikely.) The DMA’s prescriptive rules were not drafted with LLMs or other generative AI services in mind so the first version of the regulation may offer little in the way of meaningful checks on gatekeeper usage of this form of powerful automation. It would likely need to be adapted as/when specific competition concerns arise — so, again, it would be up to the Commission to propose changes. As regards DSA obligations on VLOPs/VLOSEs the most immediate consideration may well be the aforementioned “hallucination” risks — whereby LLMs could become a vector for societally damaging disinformation. So large platforms may need to be proactive about how they apply them. VLOPs/VLOSE will be designated by the Commission later this year, so it remains to be seen which of the larger platforms will fall in-scope of these obligations (but tech giants like Google and Microsoft look like a cert). Platforms will have four months after being designated to comply with the DSA, including producing the necessary risk assessments. Last year the EU also beefed up its Code of Practice against Disinformation. And while this initiative still isn’t a legal instrument — it remains voluntary self regulation — abiding by the code is being seen as a form of best practice which can count towards DSA compliance, creating an incentive to stick to it. (While, on the flip side, breaches of the DSA can attract fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover so that threat may compel platforms not to stray too far from the bloc’s digital rulebook.) Among the commitments Code signatories agreed to are to deploy measure to reduce manipulative behaviour used to spread disinformation, such as fake accounts, bot-driven amplification, impersonation, malicious deep fakes — all of which looks relevant to risks created by generative AI hallucinations. They also agreed to provide users with better tools to spot, understand and flag disinformation; beef up transparency of recommender systems; and adapt them to limit the propagation of disinformation, among a number of other commitments. We’ve also seen copyright litigation firing up on a number of fronts in relation to generative AI makers’ decisions not to license content to train models — which can sometimes be commanded to produce work in the style of named artists and writers or generate snippets of protected code on demand without the necessary credit (and/or payment). The theme here is protected content being used without up-front permission/licensing by commercial AI platforms that stand accused of trying to free-ride to profit off of others’ labor. (Although, technically speaking, being a not-for-profit (as OpenAI, for example, used to be) does not provide an escape from any legal requirements to license protected content they may use.) Examples include the class action suit against Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI which accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Github’s code-generating AI, Copilot, to produce licensed code snippets without credit; or the legal case against popular AI art tools, Midjourney and Stability AI, which alleges they infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training their tools on web-scraped images; or the case brought by stock image giant Getty also against Stability AI — for reportedly using millions of images from its site without permission to train its art-generating AI, Stable Diffusion. Machine-pastiche on demand is obviously not the same thing as human artists being inspired by others to craft harder in their own output. But the question remains how exactly does existing copyright law apply to these new tools — which can also of course be a boon for supporting human creativity and productivity. So while litigation seeks to establish whether/how current laws may be applied, the overarching debate is whether copyright need updating to clarify how to apply it to AI; and to ensure that human creativity and labor is protected in an era of increasingly capable AIs — and, if it does, where exactly should the lines be re-drawn? Copyright is often a contentious area. But it’s fair to say generative AI has fired new fuel into an oft-raging battleground. Some (like digital rights group the EFF) argue that use of works of art as training data to build generative art AI models which produce output that does not amount to literal copying is fair use (i.e. not a breach of copyright law) — given copyright generally only protects an artist’s creative expression, rather than their ideas (nor even, necessarily, a distinctive style). Others disagree — arguing that use of protected artworks to train AI models without licensing that usage breaks the law. “All of the data you put into the AI that would technically be use of copyright protected works that would typically be a type of copyright licence,” says Dr Hayleigh Bosher, a senior lecturer in IP law at Brunel University, London. “The same way that Spotify licences all the music that’s on their platform from the rights holders… and then we listen to it on the other end, there’s a licence that goes on in the background. And so my understanding of copyright law currently would be that that still applies to AI. So you would have to licence the use of the input data, based on the current law. But, again, it’s up for debate. Some people would disagree with me and we don’t know for sure because the law has never been applied in that way… Copyright law in particular is specifically designed around the human creative process.” A key issue is current legal tests for copyright infringement weren’t devised with generative AI mimics in mind. “The test for copyright infringement very much depends on the creative process of the creator. And the question is about did they take a substantial part? Did they copy, intentionally or unconsciously, the original work and did they take that bit of the human element… what makes the copyright original — the personality, touch that’s been put on the work to make it original. That’s the bit that you can’t copy in copyright for infringement. The problem with AI-created works is that because it’s generating works in a different way to how a human would that test doesn’t really apply because you probably wouldn’t be able to pinpoint exactly what they had copied…. It’s taken a little bit of everything.” Bosher argues copyright law needs to be updated to clarify how it applies in this unfolding era of generative AI art, music, film and so on. And to safeguard human endeavor — all that inherently human blood, sweat and tears and the societally valuable production that results from it — pointing out copyright law has always evolved to adapt to novel tools that change creative production and cultural consumption. “Copyright law should always evolve with technology,” she argues. “We got new copyright law when there was a photocopier. We got new copyright law when there was the camera phone… There’s new copyright law when we got the internet. And we get new laws when there’s social media. We used to always update the law to keep up with technology and culture and consumption and creativity. And that’s really normal. “The thing with AI is that it’s evolving so far that the challenge for the lawyers and the legislators is that they’re already behind schedule. They need to start thinking about this. And they need to speed up their processes. [OpenAI has] already come out with a new version — we’re on version 4 of that chatbot — and still, the policymakers are [debating] should we do something about it?” Appetite among lawmakers to update copyright laws for the generative AI era is clearly lagging tech developments. Indeed, in the U.K., ministers recently proposed to careen in the opposite direction — by removing hurdles to AI data mining. However the plan was met by outrage from the country’s creative industries and the government appears to have had a rethink. (Although it has also signalled it favors a light touch approach to AI, rather than a bespoke legal framework, so presumably it won’t be rushing to update IP licensing law either.) So it remains to be seen how the copyright vs wrongs issue evolves. On the flip side in the copyright arena, there is the (also) contested question of whether AI-generated works should be copyrightable themselves. “Whether AI can make a work that’s capable of being protected as copyright is currently an unanswerable question in the law,” says Bosher. “It’s just about how you frame your understanding of copyright law. My view is that it shouldn’t be [protected] and even if it is, it shouldn’t be protected to the same level — because it’s not doing the same thing.” The Writers Guide of America has been one swift mover here — putting out a draft set of rules last month that seeks assurances from major movie studies during a contract renegotiation that AI-generated text can only be used as research material and can’t be covered by IP.  The EFF dubs the move a “smart strategy that zeroes in on the Guild’s domain: protecting its members” — summing up the proposal thusly: “That means that if a studio wants to use an AI-generated script, there can be no credited author and no copyright. In a world where studios jealously guard the rights to their work, that’s a major poison pill. Under this proposal, studios must choose between the upfront cost of paying a writer what they are worth, and the backend cost of not having control over the copyright to the product.” Where this will all shake out remains to be seen but the economic and cultural value provided by creative industries suggests artists and writers may, ultimately, come away with more protections for their labor than software engineers — a field where there is, conversely, more demand than (humans can) supply, so more of an argument for applying automation to scale productivity. (Coders’ labor may also simply be more easily rechannelled into higher level work atop automated code, than creative human labor that’s forced to abandon making art.) The whole point of copyright is “the encouragement of learning and creativity and culture”, according to Bosher, who argues simply automation doesn’t align with that mission. “It’s kind of a social contract where we give rights to people who make stuff and then in exchange we get culture and knowledge and learning and it progresses society. There’s actually quite a high service type of law, trying to make the world a better place through creativity and culture. AI creativity is not aligning with that same purpose,” she says. “For me, it comes down to the fact that if you think about what is the purpose of this AI program that you’ve created? And is it trying to make the world a better place? Is it solving problems? Is it helping society? And maybe some people see it in a short sighted way. They’re like, yeah, this is easier now, I don’t have to write the blog post. But let’s think long term about the kind of world we want to live in. And is that going in a good direction?… I just think we should value the human creator and understand the value that has to society, and I just don’t think AI should be replacing that.” “Do we need AI to make a new song for us? I don’t think we do. It’s already a saturated market,” she adds. “AI is not solving a problem for us in that situation… We have other problems that need solving in the music industry in particular — we’ve got data issues, we’ve got inclusivity issues. If [someone said] we’ve invented this AI, it’s gonna solve these problems for you, then I’d be like great! Encourage that creativity. But at the minute, especially in the creative industries, AI creativity doesn’t need to be supported.” Intellectual property is a private right which means it’s up to rights holders to take enforcement action against entities they believe are infringing their protected content — hence why we’re seeing legal requests and litigation firing up on various fronts. And in another example just this week, the Financial Times reported that Universal Music Group has asked streaming platforms including Spotify to block AI services from scraping arrangement and lyrics from their copyrighted songs, with the music giant saying it has a “moral and commercial responsibility” to its artists to try to prevent unauthorised use of their music, and also leaning on “platform partners” to get on the same side of the fight and “prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists”, as it put it. Despite a rising number of legal requests and lawsuits by rights holders targeting generative AI tech, Bosher suggests the lack of clarity around how copyright law applies is likely preventing more from taking steps to protect their IP at this point. Given the risks of losing a test case, many rights holders may be keeping their powder dry and waiting for lawmakers to clarify how the law applies (or, indeed, update it to reboot protections) before moving to litigate. Of course, the risk is if they wait too long usage of the technology might become embedded as a mainstream utility and lawsuits that seek to unpick that may be met with public outrage, heaping reputational damage on the rights holders attempting to slay popular tools. So the onus really is on policymakers to get a handle on a thorny issue and figure out a fair way forward. “For someone to bring a test case they have to be in a very financially secure situation where they’re willing to risk losing, and you’re not just going to lose the money in the case if you lose, you’re also going to lose your business model,” she notes. “So we need clarity. And also we need some decisions to be made… Are we going to protect AI created works? If so, what does that look like? What’s the scope? And how are we going to protect?”   Litigation could also fall on generative AI makers via claims brought under existing libel laws. Reuters recently reported that OpenAI could be facing a defamation suit in Australia over false claims ChatGPT generated about a regional mayor. The news agency said the technology had falsely stated that the elected mayor of Hepburn Shire, Brian Hood, had served time in prison for bribery. We’ve dug into this topic before — and, as with copyright, the first-order legal issue is a lack of clarity around how the law applies to automated defamatory statements. So it may well take a test case like Hood’s (if indeed he brings one) to start setting some precedents. That said, given the speed with which generative AI is being embedded into our systems and workflows, lawmakers may be forced to grapple with delineating liability for generative AI falsehoods sooner rather than later — before these tools scale unaccountable fake news out of control. The production of fake details about named individuals is not unusual where generative AI (or even more basic forms of automation) is concerned. It appears to occur pretty regularly with LLMs, a technology that’s prone to filling in gaps in its training data by making stuff up. To the point where OpenAI and other model makers have a word for it — referring to these factual failures by AI chatbots as “hallucinations”. It’s less clear whether this truth flaw essentially comes baked in to general purpose AIs (which can’t literally know everything but can be asked anything) — or whether developers of these models will, at some point, figure out far more effective systems for preventing the outputting of statements that are at best wrong and might also risk being viewed as defamation. In the release of GPT-4, OpenAI claimed the model “significantly reduces hallucinations relative to previous models”, which it also said had “been improving with each iteration” — claiming it had scored 40% higher on its topic-based internal evaluations than GPT-3. But OpenAI also conceded GPT-4 is “still is not fully reliable” — confirming that “it [still] ‘hallucinates’ facts and makes reasoning errors”. In our experience using ChatGPT, at times the company seems to have experimented with shifting its ‘safety sliders’ for this purpose. For example by dialling up the likelihood that the chatbot will refuse to respond to queries asking it for information about named individuals — which is one hard-stop way to prevent it spewing outrageous falsehoods. Evidently, though, the raison d’etre of generative AI is to be useful. Which demands it has the capacity to respond to questions it’s asked. Which means that considerations about dialling up safety checks to curb “hallucinations” are in clear tension with the core USP claimed for ChatGPT, as a universal helpmate. Moreover, the more powerful these models get, the more potential risks emerge as a consequence of the expanded field of content they’re capable of producing — as OpenAI acknowledges in its blog post, writing: “GPT-4 poses similar risks as previous models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT-4 lead to new risk surfaces”. So, clearly, tackling hallucinations is not a simple problem and the notion of a complete fix might be wishful thinking. In the meanwhile, reports of ChatGPT’s capacity to compose plausible-sounding but erroneous personal histories — not always obviously defamatory, given an apparent tendency to sometimes be biased towards more conventional success paths (but the content is still wrong) — continue to surface, suggesting OpenAI remains very far from getting on top of fast-scaling AI-generated lies. This happened to me during a live intro for my festival keynote last week when the host pulled up my bio from ChatGPT on the big screen. PhD from UC Berkeley, which I’ve never attended. Was this error random? No, it’s worse: 1/n https://t.co/6HD6BI0QDC — Shannon Vallor (@ShannonVallor) April 9, 2023  In other instances the chatbot has dreamt up the titles of fake books and newspaper articles that were not, in fact, written by the named individual the technology claimed. Or made up citations of (fictional) research papers — even sometimes attributing them to real people who didn’t write them either. Any one of which could wreak reputational damage, depending on what citations and references the bot is hallucinating into existence this time. On top of this, there is the overarching issue that such confident sounding lies also work to blur the line between reality and fantasy which may present major, collective risks for human civilization — atop of the individual harms. One thing is clear: “Hallucination” remains a big problem for developers of generative AI in spite of the misleadingly superficial-sounding label they’ve sought to badge the issue with. Notably they did not pick the word ‘disinformation’ — a term that is widely discussed by policymakers in the context of social media content moderation, alongside other toxic issues like hate speech (if not typically as tightly regulated). But if you reframe AI hallucination as AI-generated disinformation it’s easier to see what type of regulations might apply to such content. As noted above, the EU has its Code of Practice against Online Disinformation, for example — whose signatories include OpenAI investor Microsoft; and Google, maker of the ChatGPT rival Bard, to name two of the several tech giants who have committed to applying measures to combat the spread of online falsities. One perhaps surprising additional revelation that’s emerged in recent weeks is that the GDPR is set up to regulate a sub-set of AI-generated disinformation — at least per the Italian DPA’s interpretation of it — given it’s ordered OpenAI to provide tools so people can ask for corrections to false statements ChatGPT generates about them. And if the company can’t technically correct the AI-generated disinformation it’s been told it will have to delete the person’s data entirely, in a bid to prevent recurring falsities about named individuals. If this interpretation of the GDPR is sustained, the implication is that scores of EU citizens could request removal of their data from learning algorithms — reshaping what generative AIs are able to output by exerting existing long-standing rights to privacy and protection against personal disinformation. So regulating hallucinating AIs is already shaping up to be a major battleground.  "
217,Lyft shares tumble as investors react to dim outlook,"['Rebecca Bellan', 'Kirsten Korosec']","May 4, 2023","Lyft shares tanked as much as 12% moments after the company reported first-quarter earnings as investors placed more weight on a dim outlook and lower quarter-over-quarter revenue than other financial gains.  Shares have since stabilized in after-hours trading, now trading down about 10%.   Lyft beat both its own revenue expectations and Wall Street’s, but it wasn’t enough to assuage investors focused on the ride-hailing company’s future.  The company closed the first quarter of the year with $1 billion in revenue, up 14% from the same quarter last year. It should be noted that its Q1 revenue is lower than $1.2 billion it generated in Q4. Analysts had expected $977 million for the first quarter, and the company promised $975 million in February.  That revenue gain is on top of a net loss of $187.6 million, a 4.7% improvement from the $196.9 million it lost in the same period last year. It’s also significantly better than the $588.1 million in net losses posted in the fourth quarter of 2022. Lyft attributed much of that loss in Q4 to $201.3 million of stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses. On an adjusted basis, Lyft earned $22.7 million, compared to $54.9 million a year ago. It is an improvement from the adjusted loss of $248.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The company’s operating cash flow was in negative territory for the quarter with a loss of  $188 million. Lyft closed out the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million, an increase from $281 million last quarter. Lyft issued guidance for the second quarter of about $1 billion to $1.02 billion, an indication that the company is not expecting much growth in the coming quarter. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, Lyft expects to earn between $20 million and $30 million, with an adjusted margin of 2% to 3%.  Notably, the company did not issue guidance for the full year, a move that can suggest the company is uncertain about its future or an expectation of changes to come.  The first quarter has been a tumultuous one for Lyft as the company brought on a new CEO and president, issued layoffs for 26% of its staff and dropped certain offerings like shared rides. David Risher, the former Amazon executive who took over for co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, said he wanted Lyft to focus on the basics of ride-hail. Given these cost-cutting measures and the coming of warmer seasons, which are usually a boon for the ride-hail industry, investors might be put off by second-quarter revenue guidance that mirrors the first quarter.  During Lyft’s earnings call Thursday, analysts and investors will want to know how the new leader will help Lyft continue to compete with Uber. The ride-hail competitor beat analysts’ expectations and demonstrated strong financial footing due to its business model that spans across ride-hail and delivery.  Meanwhile, Lyft has been cutting away the extra fat off its business since last year when it closed down its car rental scheme. This quarter, the company is also shutting down its Fleet products focused on personal car ownership and is spinning off Loop, the company’s cloud infrastructure, into a standalone business. Loop was operating in stealth mode and had a single-digit team, according to a Lyft spokesperson.  Lyft didn’t share much in the way of updates about its bikeshare business. Risher only reiterated the company’s plan to create more of a cross-pollinating ecosystem between bikeshare and ride-hail, but didn’t get into specifics. That side of the business is also expected to see some cuts as it gets “leaner and more focused,” according to an April blog post from the company."
218,Apple opens its first retail store in India but customer challenges persist,['@refsrc'],"April 18, 2023","Apple chief executive Tim Cook opened the first Apple store in India on Tuesday in a significant milestone for the iPhone maker roughly 25 years after entering the South Asian market. During his India trip, his first in years, Cook has planned meetings with prominent business leaders, including Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani and Tata Group’s Natarajan Chandrasekaran, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Apple steps up its battle against Samsung over the luxury smartphone market in Asia’s second-biggest economy. The U.S. giant’s first official store — and a second retail location is scheduled to open in New Delhi on Thursday — comes at a time when Apple is ramping up its manufacturing drive in India, hoping to turn one of the world’s largest smartphone markets into a key global iPhone assembling hub. Apple’s iPhones currently assume less than 5% of the Indian smartphone market, but the share has grown in recent years as more Indians buy premium handsets. The opening of Apple’s 20,000-square-foot store in the Reliance-owned high-end shopping mall in the financial capital Mumbai attracted hundreds of people who queued to see Cook open the glass doors. The establishment of Apple’s first retail stores and the company’s increased efforts to assemble iPhones and other products in India underscore the importance of the South Asian market to the Cupertino-based tech giant. According to JPMorgan analysts, Apple is expected to expand its manufacturing capacity in India to produce 25% of all iPhones by 2025. The company’s increased production is already beginning to pay off. Apple exported more than $5 billion worth of smartphones from India, nearly half of all the exports from the country, in the financial year that ended in March, according to industry analysts. “At Apple, our mission is to enrich lives and empower people around the world,” Cook said in a statement Monday. “India has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we’re excited to build on our long-standing history — supporting our customers, investing in local communities, and working together to build a better future with innovations that serve humanity.” The energy, creativity, and passion in Mumbai is incredible! We are so excited to open Apple BKC — our first store in India. pic.twitter.com/talx2ZQEMl — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) April 18, 2023  However, the benefits of these initiatives have yet to be fully realized by one crucial stakeholder: Apple’s customers. Despite local iPhone assembly and the company’s contract partners reaping the rewards of New Delhi’s generous incentives, Apple products, including the iPhone, remain prohibitively expensive in India in a move that has stunned analysts who thought Apple will pass on the incentives to customers. Take the base model iPhone 14 Pro, for instance. It is priced at $999 in the U.S. but retails for close to $1,600 in India. The iPhone 14 is not an isolated example, of course. The second-generation HomePod, which retails for $299 in the U.S., costs $401 in India. Official iPhone cases are similarly priced to some of the country’s top-selling Android smartphones. It’s no surprise, then, that Google’s Android commands about 97% of the local smartphone market, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint. Moreover, even after paying a hefty price, Apple customers in India do not get access to scores of services. Several popular Apple services, such as News+, Fitness+, and Apple Pay, remain unavailable to Indian consumers. The Apple Card and its accompanying savings account feature in the U.S. are also absent from the Indian market. Apple Maps and Siri offer fewer features to Indian customers. In contrast, many global giants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Walmart and Samsung, have plowed tens of billions of dollars in India in the past decade and offer nearly all of their global services to Indian customers — often at dirt-cheap prices. Google Pay and Walmart’s PhonePe lead the mobile payments market in India. The reality is that millions of Indian consumers continue to purchase Apple products despite feeling like second-tier customers. While Tim Cook’s visit to India every five years is a noteworthy event, it has yet to bring about substantial change for the country’s Apple enthusiasts."
219,"Bonus BeReal comes to UK, lets users post more than once a day",['@asilbwrites'],"April 24, 2023","BeReal is piloting its new Bonus BeReal feature in the U.K. Expected to roll out soon in other countries, this allows users to post more than once per day — you get two Bonus BeReal posts if you manage to upload on time during the two-minute daily window, and one extra post if you miss the window. Your Bonus BeReal can be posted whenever you desire. BeReal went viral last year for its refreshingly authentic approach to social media. Each day at a random time, all users are prompted with a notification that it is “time to BeReal” — in other words, it’s time to stop what you’re doing and within two minutes, take a front and back camera photo to share with your friends. Instead of only seeing the highlights of our friends’ lives on their Instagram story, we might see BeReal posts of people watching Netflix on the couch, or folding laundry. While some users embrace the reminder that there’s more to life than our most picturesque moments, other users have opted to just wait and post their daily BeReal when they’re doing something interesting, which sort of defeats the app’s purpose of encouraging authenticity. Also, it’s kind of boring to see that your friends are at work at 2 PM on a Tuesday. “We’ve all been there…” BeReal wrote in a blog post. “The BeReal notification goes off before we’re at the concert, out to dinner, or connecting with family and friends, and we’re faced with the ultimate decision: post late or miss the moment.” Image Credits: BeReal Image Credits: BeReal The Bonus BeReal feature almost feels like a concession that many users are just posting late anyway, since the consequences for missing the two-minute window are so minimal. Now, users will be incentivized to post on time if they can, since they’ll get not one, but two Bonus BeReal posts. It’s a clever way to boost engagement, but it could also shift the app’s culture. As BeReal took over app store charts and faced copycat features from TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, the team behind the impromptu photo sharing app was unusually quiet. The France-based startup refused to talk on the record to the press and stayed out of any discourse around the app (and there was a lot — it was even the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” skit). Now, along with the announcement of Bonus BeReal, the company is breaking its silence by announcing that it has 20 million daily active users (DAUs). Our sources also told us in October that BeReal had 20 million DAUs; plus, we learned that BeReal closed a $60 million Series B round at a $587 million valuation. Today’s 20 million DAU figure could be additional confirmation of that same data point we received six months ago. Or, it could be a sign that growth has slowed. BeReal claimed that previous reports of the app’s DAUs were not accurate, and that growth has remained steady. Update, 4/24/23, 9:40 AM ET with additional comment from BeReal.    "
220,Secondary market trackers are lighting up a traditionally dark deal environment,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 12, 2023","As many private companies try to avoid raising capital in the current market, it’s become significantly harder to figure out what companies are actually worth. But a market that’s traditionally even less transparent than venture is providing clues. The secondary market, where investors can buy and sell existing stakes in a startup or fund, offers a more fluid way to tell how buyers and sellers are valuing companies between formal funding rounds. These deals were traditionally harder to track than primary venture capital deals, as they don’t generally get announced, but a new fleet of startups is shining light on them. Over the past few years, multiple startups including Caplight and Notice have launched products that track both completed secondary deals as well as bids from buyers and sellers, offering users a real-time view of how investors are valuing companies. Others including Birel and Hiive Markets look to make it easier to trade secondary stakes. Caplight’s co-founder and CEO, Javier Avalos, told TechCrunch+ earlier this year that he was inspired to build his company because he felt the lack of transparency in the market prevented institutional investors from being able to properly hedge bets in the space or accurately protect against downside risk. Tyson Hendricksen said he launched Notice in 2021 because he felt the industry he had worked as a broker in for years wasn’t accessible enough to all of the underlying stakeholders it affected — specifically, company employees with stock options. “I was so appalled at how fragmented and busted the data was, even as a broker who was active every day,” he told TechCrunch+. “It was really hard to figure out what was going on. That was my job. For anyone else who had a half-an-hour lunch break and wanted to figure out if they wanted to sell their shares or not, it was really hard.”"
221,"Apple Watch to see its biggest software update since its 2015 debut, report says",['@sarahintampa'],"April 17, 2023","The Apple Watch’s software is due to get its biggest update since its release, according to a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Though details on the watchOS 10’s updated design were sparse to non-existent, the report teases Apple’s plans to introduce a revamped interface for its popular wearable at this year’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, alongside its mixed-reality headset, new Mac laptops and iOS 17. While the updated versions of iOS and iPadOS were previously said to be more minor releases bringing several of users’ most requested features, and possibly the groundwork for sideloading apps onto the devices from outside the App Store, the watchOS update may be even more significant, if the report holds true. This isn’t the first time Gurman has reported on Apple’s plans to update the Apple Watch’s operating system with the new watchOS, but it does now position the upgrade as the most significant user interface update since the Watch’s launch, which was not previously known. Earlier this month, Gurman had only said the new watchOS should be a “fairly extensive upgrade” with changes to the user interface. The Apple Watch’s software hasn’t received a major overhaul in terms of its user interface since its debut in 2015. But plenty of designers have taken their own shots at a makeover with various watchOS concepts that rethink the home screen from the array of tiny apps you navigate with a finger to those that embrace different ideas — including more iPhone-like concepts that also support widgets or app folders, among other things. According to Gurman’s latest, the updated watchOS 10 will “bring bigger enhancements” than the releases planned for iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV. This includes the “updated interface,” that will tell you “most of what you need to know about the Apple Watch in 2023,” he says. The report notes that the rest of the hardware changes will be minimal so the software update will be the Watch’s biggest news and main focus. Little more was said about what the updated interface could include, but parsing the wording carefully could lead one to believe it’s not a complete overhaul of the interface, as it’s being referred to as an “update” not a “redesign.” Still, there’s a lot of anticipation for a fresh experience for the Apple Watch, whose software is starting to feel a little dated after numerous iOS releases that have rethought how apps are organized and engaged with, including the introductions of things like automatically organized folders in the App Library, interactive widgets via Live Activities, and both Home Screen and Lock Screen widgets for displaying live app information. Of course, all these ideas can’t necessarily translate directly to a smartwatch interface — which uses complications, not widgets to display info, for example, and where limited screen real estate requires different ideas and types of interactions. To date, that’s led to most watchOS releases being more minor tweaks, with most of the user interface changes coming via things like new watch faces. Apple’s WWDC 2023 will run from June 5 through June 9, kicking off with the company’s keynote address where Apple is expected to release its new AR/VR headset and the xrOS powering it, alongside other software updates.

222,"Dropbox lays off 500 employees, 16% of staff, CEO says due to slowing growth and ‘the era of AI’",['@ingridlunden'],"April 27, 2023","Cloud storage giant Dropbox today joined the fray of tech companies announcing layoffs. The company today announced that it would be laying off 16% of its staff, equivalent to about 500 employees, due to slowing growth, and — in the words of CEO Drew Houston — because “the AI era of computing has finally arrived.” These appear to be the first layoffs the company has made since January 2021, when it laid off 315 employees in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest cull was announced to staff in a memo from CEO and co-founder Drew Houston, as well as in an SEC filing. The SEC filing noted that the company will incur charges of approximately $37 million to $42 million in connection with layoffs, which will be recorded in Q2. Q1 results, which will be reported next Thursday, May 4, will be in-line or even above expectations, it added. Ironically, even with the strong results, and the fact that Dropbox is profitable, Houston said the company is choosing to take a preemptive step to cut jobs and invest in new areas to keep up with the pace of change, given that growth is slowing. “While our business is profitable, our growth has been slowing. Part of this is due to the natural maturation of our existing businesses, but more recently, headwinds from the economic downturn have put pressure on our customers and, in turn, on our business. As a result, some investments that used to deliver positive returns are no longer sustainable,” he wrote. The interesting thing is that he also cites AI as a major factor. “Second, and more consequentially, the AI era of computing has finally arrived,” he continued. “We’ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we’ve been building towards this future for a long time, as this year’s product pipeline will demonstrate.” For those who have been warning that AI will inevitably lead to the loss of more jobs, this will come as an alarming development. The more cynical might argue that it’s an easy and timely excuse for cutting costs right now, to keep the market and investors optimistic that Dropbox is changing with the times and itself won’t get disrupted in the next wave of innovation. Houston said that impacted staff will be getting notified today and will be finished with work by tomorrow. The company had 3,125 employees prior to the move today. More than 184,000 people have been laid off in the tech sector in 2023 across nearly 620 tech companies, according to the Layoffs.fyi tracker. More to come."

224,"Checks, the AI-powered data protection project incubated in Area 120, officially ‘exits’ to Google",['@ingridlunden'],"May 3, 2023","After Google cut all but three of the projects at its in-house incubator Area 120 and shifted it to work on AI projects across Google, one of the legacy efforts — coincidentally also an AI project — is now officially exiting to Google. Checks, an AI-powered tool to check mobile apps for compliance with various privacy rules and regulations, is moving into Google proper as a privacy product aimed at mobile developers. Checks originally made its debut in February 2022, although it was in development for some time before that. In its time at Area 120, it became one of the largest projects in the group, co-founders Fergus Hurley and Nia Castelly told me, with 10 people fully dedicated to it and a number of others contributing less formally. The founders’ job titles under Google will now be GM and Legal Lead, respectively, for Checks. The amount that Google invested in the project was never disclosed, nor was the valuation of the exit to the parent company from the incubator, but the company has confirmed that there was a valuation and that it had grown since launch. The company is not disclosing how many customers it has in total but notes that they are in the sectors of gaming, health, finance, education and retail. A sampling includes Miniclip, Rovio, Kongregate, Crayola and Yousician and in total the number of customers represented by its customers is over 3 billion. Checks will sit in the Developer X division. “What Fergus, Nia, and the entire Google Checks team have accomplished is one of the hardest things to do. Their focus on customer needs and nimble execution has served them well, and we’re eager to push ahead in this next phase of Checks,” said Jeanine Banks in a statement. Checks is one of those ideas that feels incredibly timely in that it speaks to an issue that’s growing in importance for consumers — who will vote with their feet when they feel that their privacy is in jeopardy. That in turn also puts more pressure on developers to get things right on the privacy front. App publishers these days are faced with a growing array of rules and regulations around data protection and privacy, not just rules like GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California (and the U.S.) set across different countries and jurisdictions, but also by companies that operate platforms within their own compliance efforts. When translated into how those regulations impact apps, there are potential issues at the front end, as well as on the back end, with how apps are coded and information moves from one place to another to consider. It’s a spaghetti bowl of issues, with fixes in one area potentially impacting another and making user experience less smooth to boot. Checks leans on artificial intelligence and machine learning to scan apps and their code to identify areas where there might be violations of privacy and data protection rules, and provides remediation to suggest how to fix it — tasks that would be far more difficult for a team of humans to execute on their own. It’s already integrated with Google’s large language models and what it describes as “app understanding technologies” to power what it identifies and make suggestions for fixing issues.  A dashboard lets users monitor and triage issues in the areas of compliance monitoring, data monitoring and store disclosure support (which is focused specifically on Google Play data safety). With the service also aimed at iOS developers, it’s not clear if it will add Apple App Store data safety at any point into that mix. All of this can be monitored in real time on live apps, as well as when they are still in development. We have reached out to Google to get an update on the status of the other two projects that were spared all-out closure after Area 120 changed focus. They include video dubbing solution Aloud and an as-yet unnamed consumer product from the team that had previously built a bookmarking app Liist (which got acquired by Google). As of right now, Liist’s co-founder David Friedl still describes himself on LinkedIn as working on a stealth product at Area 120, and Aloud is still using an Area 120 URL, so it seems that they remain in a holding pattern. (We’ll update this if and when we hear more.) In the meantime, Area 120 itself is also seeing some revolving doors. Clay Bavor, who was running Area 120 among other things and who messaged the big changes to staff in January, was out the door just a month later. He has now teamed up with Bret Taylor — another ex-Googler who has an outsized track record that includes being the CTO of Facebook and the co-CEO of Salesforce — to work on a mystery startup. Updated with more information about Checks’ valuation and quote from Google."

The SoftBank-backed company announced Friday at a company open day a series of product ambitions, including working with Chinese carmakers to deploy self-developed robotaxis to the public on a 24/7 basis by 2025, which will complement its network of millions of drivered cars. In 2020, Didi created an autonomous driving subsidiary that went on to raise funding from SoftBank, an existing investor in the parent firm. Like most robotaxi companies, Didi opted to partner with OEMs to build its autonomous fleets. It’s so far used vehicles from Lincoln, BYD, Nissan and Volvo. In 2021, the company said it would be buying cars from Volvo, an old partner of Uber, to work on “hundreds of autonomous drive-ready vehicles with backup systems.” Aside from robotaxis that resemble conventional passenger cars, Didi is touting a concept vehicle tailored completely to self driving. The concept car, which was unveiled at its open day in a demo video, is a spacious rectangular van with no steering wheel or driver’s seat (shown above). Instead, “Neuron,” what the car is called, features a large in-car infotainment screen and has a robotic arm that can pick up suitcases and hand passengers a bottle of water. Didi is also automating maintenance services for its vehicles. In a video, the company shows its autonomous cars getting washed, charged and checked at its service center — all done without human help. Didi’s ambitions don’t stop at shuttling humans around. At the event, it announced a brand new autonomous trucking business named Kargobot, joining an already crowded space.

However, the video platform insisted that it is committed to building “a seamless shopping experience for viewers and supporting creators’ businesses.” Simsim sought to help small businesses in India transition to e-commerce by leveraging the rising popularity of video and creators. The startup’s eponymous app acted as a platform to connect local businesses, influencers and customers. YouTube acquired Simsim in mid-2021 in a deal that valued the Indian firm at over $70 million. At the time, YouTube said the acquisition will enable the video streaming giant to help small businesses and retailers in India reach new customers in even more powerful ways. With over 450 million users, the South Asian market is the largest for YouTube. The video platform also perceives India as a testbed (YouTube Go and Shorts being two examples). Its acquisition of Simsim came at a time when YouTube was beginning to explore ways to expand the video platform into an e-commerce engine. The thesis in India, according to Rohan Malhotra of Good Capital, which has backed Meesho as well as Simsim, was: “micro-influencers are more effective at building a targeted audience (growth), creating entertaining experiences (retention), building trust (higher value) and personalising messaging (conversion).” “Consumer social platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) cannot meaningfully monetise via advertising-financed models in India; this unlocks the opportunity for more deeply integrated transactional platforms. New internet users in India need an interactive seller-led experience to replicate the offline e-commerce experience this market is used to,” he told TechCrunch earlier. The time may not have arrived for the thesis yet. Facebook last year shut down its live shopping feature as it shifted its focus to Reels. But not everyone is giving up. Amazon, which acquired the Indian social commerce startup GlowRoad last year, has introduced QVC-style livestream shopping in the country. The retail group’s service, called Amazon Live, brings an army of more than 150 creators to host livestreams and plug products in the videos. The idea is that influencers, with their already large followings, will drive their fans to the shopping app and influence them into buying products. They get a cut each time they are able to make a sale. YouTube is not moving entirely away from the category, though. A spokesperson said Thursday that the company will be “working with creators to introduce more monetization opportunities for creators through an affiliate program and more shopping features across long-form videos, Shorts and livestreams on YouTube in 2023.”"
227,Everything you need to know about parametric insurance,"['Anna Heim', 'Ram Iyer']","April 7, 2023","Insurance is one of the few industries that have remained largely unchanged over the past few decades at a low level: You suffer losses as a direct result of something going south, and you get paid by your insurer. But that old model doesn’t always work. For example, a construction company in a region regularly affected by hurricanes might see its projects surviving these storms mostly unscathed, but it might still see losses in terms of time and other potential costs because crews simply couldn’t make it to work. Your traditional indemnity policy might pay this company based on the magnitude of its losses but wouldn’t have to pay for those unforeseen, follow-on costs because they aren’t “damages” in the usual sense. One could argue the company is getting the short end of the stick here. Parametric insurance, on the other hand, ensures that everyone can win. Instead of insuring customers based on the magnitude of the losses incurred, parametric contracts insure customers against the magnitude of events. So in our example, the construction company may see a payout if there is a certain “trigger event,” such as the area is hit by a Category 4 hurricane or higher, or if the wind speed reaches a certain, pre-specified mark. Investor Nina Mayer, a principal at Earlybird Venture Capital, defined it quite succinctly in our recent insurtech survey: Parametric insurance (as opposed to traditional indemnity insurance) is an insurance type that pre-specifies the amount of payout based on concrete “trigger” events. For example, the payout could be linked to a certain weather event, such as the height of a river above the flood point. This type of insurance is also called index-based insurance because it relies on data and automation, a combination that explains why this approach is enjoying tailwinds. Instead of filing and reviewing claims, both parties can rely on information showing that a trigger event occurred. Leveraging data in this way makes the process more efficient for both the insurer and the insured. “The key advantages of parametric insurance are fast payouts, high flexibility and the option to provide coverage for losses that are difficult to model,” Mayer said. The fast payouts that this model facilitates make it particularly useful for weather-related insurance, where those affected are most benefited by quick access to funds. That is clearly evidenced by the number of insurtech startups building parametric solutions for this space."
228,Lyft CEO and president stepping down to be replaced by former Amazon exec,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 27, 2023","UPDATE: This article has been updated with compensation package information for Green, Zimmer and Risher. Lyft co-founders, CEO Logan Green and president John Zimmer, are stepping down from their roles by mid-April, the company said Wednesday. They will serve as chair and vice chair of Lyft’s board, respectively. David Risher, a former retail executive at Amazon, will take over the CEO position at Lyft. Lyft’s current chairman, Sean Aggarwal, will step down from his post but will stay on the board. Green and Zimmer founded Lyft in 2012. Back then, the company was mainly differentiated from Uber by the presence of pink mustaches on Lyft vehicles. Back then, Zimmer told TechCrunch that Lyft had originally thought of doing the service just for women, “as a safety kind of service and a very particular clientele.” Lyft ditched the mustache in 2016 and went public three years later. When it debuted, Lyft raised more than $2 billion in an afternoon after pricing its shares at $72 each. Today, Lyft closed at $9.60 per share; however, the stock price did jump nearly 6% after hours on the news of Risher taking over as CEO. Risher joined Amazon in 1997 as the company’s first VP of product and store development. He moved up through the ranks at the side of Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, and served as SVP of marketing and merchandising before leaving Amazon in 2002. He helped transform the company from an online bookstore with $15 million in annual sales to the “everything store” with over $4 billion in sales, according to a statement from Lyft. Today Risher is the CEO and co-founder of Worldreader, a nonprofit that aims to get children interested in reading. Perhaps it is this community-minded spirit that aligns well with Lyft’s original founding goals as a company. He will step down as CEO there and stay on as board president, according to a LinkedIn post. Risher, who joined the Lyft board of directors in 2021, will take over the full leadership responsibilities for the company’s operations on April 17, according to the company. Lyft said there would be no change to the company’s previously announced first-quarter 2023 revenue, contribution margin and adjusted EBITDA outlook. When Lyft shared its fourth-quarter and full year 2022 earnings in February, the company lowered its revenue expectations for Q1 2023 to $975 million, a decline of about $200 million. Analysts had expected the company to promise $1.09 billion in revenue. That guidance sent shares tumbling 25% in after-hours trading to $12.13, and they have continued to drop in the intervening weeks. According to SEC filings, Lyft is paying Risher an annual salary of $725,000, with an annual target bonus opportunity of 100% of that salary for each fiscal year he’s employed with Lyft, based on the achievement of certain performance goals. This year, though, his annual bonus will be $1 million as long as he stays with the company through mid-March 2024. Risher is also getting a signing bonus of $3.25 million. The new CEO’s compensation package includes an award of performance-based restricted stock units covering a total of 12.25 million shares, which Risher can vest upon the attainment of certain stock price goals. Green and Zimmer will receive $450,000 cash each for their positions on the board. They will both maintain their original award agreements on a pre-set timeline as long as they remain service providers to the company. If they get fired, that timeline accelerates and they will be able to access their equity awards as defined in Lyft’s 2019 equity incentive plan. On top of that, they’ll both be granted an award of restricted stock units covering a number of shares of Lyft’s stock with a value of $260,000, effective on the date of the company’s annual meeting of stockholders. And despite the move away from day-to-day operations, Lyft’s dual-class structure empowers Green and Zimmer long after they leave the company. They both still hold high-voting shares that entitle them to 20 votes per share until both of them are dead. If one dies or becomes incapacitated, Lyft’s sunset clause enables the remaining co-founder to control the votes of the deceased/incapacitated co-founder. And when they’re both dead, a trustee will retain the last living co-founder’s full voting powers for a transition period of nine to 18 months."
229,7 common pitfalls for hardware startups and how to avoid them,['@Haje'],"April 18, 2023","You’ve likely heard that “hardware is hard”; mostly because hardware startups have to deal with things that software companies don’t really have to worry about. That includes pesky details such as “physics” and “battery management” and “general wear and tear.” Hardware development is complex and challenging. Physical parts have tolerances, both in size and material properties, and components get hot and their characteristics change when they do. Once you’ve designed a product, the manufacturing process itself poses significant challenges. Ensuring that components are produced with the required precision and quality demands careful planning and rigorous testing throughout the process. Hardware manufacturers often work with multiple suppliers and manage supply chain logistics, which can be resource intensive and time-consuming. Hardware development is inherently a lot more costly than cranking out software. Developing a physical product requires substantial investment in materials, tooling, manufacturing and logistics. These expenses, combined with the need for multiple iterations of prototypes, can make the process financially risky, particularly for resource-constrained startups. There are plenty of pitfalls, and as a hardware nerd myself (I founded a hardware startup, which I then spectacularly ran into the ground at high velocity, making mistakes that most experienced hardware folks would laugh at these days), I am always curious to learn how hardware entrepreneurs can avoid some of the common mistakes.   Sera Evcimen knows a thing or two about the challenges for hardware startups. She’s a mechanical engineer and worked at four startups, including satellite design, consumer electronics, doing systems integration in an R&D department for a fusion startup and working on ion thrusters. These days, she’s a technical program manager for a large company she can’t name, where she’s working on soft robotics for human interaction, and she’s an all-star mentor for the Techstars startup accelerator. She even runs her own consultancy to boot. She’s working on a podcast called The Builder Circle, where she breaks down the challenges and risks of building hardware companies. Like I said, she knows her stuff, and we chatted about things to avoid when building hardware. As a startup, you are an organization designed for learning, and learning is sensationally exciting. But it has its downsides: As you continue to learn, it’s tempting to try to chase every great opportunity that comes along. The mistake is to fall for the temptation and lose focus. “Oftentimes, this sneaks up on people because people have completely different systems that they’re trying to push forward,” Evcimen told me. “They’re saying, ‘Oh, this could work in this application, and this application and this application.’ Alternatively, a company may say, ‘Oh, it’s just the same thing, but bigger,’ or ‘It’s just the same thing, but smaller.’ I think it’s really important to know that each variation of a product is just an additional product line. Similarity doesn’t mean anything. Even if that is true, you still have to have individual designs; you still need to manage your supply chain. And … you even need to develop multiple supply chains.” A smaller module might mean different chips. A different casing could mean different molds and tooling. Each small change can affect the whole product development timeline. Even something as simple as launching exactly the same product in a different color can create significant bottlenecks. “Working on more than one version takes away from early learning because you’re trying to do too much at once. You’re already a small team, trying to operate with cost constraints and time constraints,” she said. “It also dilutes the understanding of the market: If you do your proper due diligence and your user studies and market research, you’ll start to get a sense of which one is going to be potentially the most lucrative, or which variant you can use to learn quicker. By giving up focus, you are going to start learning slowly on all of them. That means you need to bet on one, rather than pursuing one that has the most potential.” And that can be a killer: Startups raise money, then make a bunch of products, trying to push them all forward at once. If something happens in the production process, they’re stuck with a bunch of half-baked products, sucking up funding along the way. It’s a spiral, and it’s not pointed in the right direction. "
230,Decentralized finance may be the answer to banking’s payment rails problem,['@christinemhall'],"April 17, 2023","Aging payment rails is not a new problem for the U.S. banking infrastructure, but Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse put it in the spotlight, especially for payment companies that had their payment rails with the bank. A payment rail is a network for how payments move from the payer to the payee. We’ve seen newer rails emerge in recent years, for example, the blockchain, and within the consumer realm with peer-to-peer payments via apps like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle. Most of the payments occur in real time. Airbase was one of those fintech companies that had its payment rails with SVB. CEO Thejo Kote told TechCrunch+ that the company had to scramble to help customers make sure their payroll and vendor payments were able to resume and also remain secure. Current payment rails, particularly in the U.S., are decades old, created long before digital payments became a way of life. In recent years, financial technology companies have built rails on top of existing infrastructure, for example Stripe, Plaid and the like, but it takes years and millions of dollars to do it. Visa, too, recently partnered with PayPal, which also owns Venmo, and others to help people make digital payments regardless of which app you use. But even with this technology, some fintech founders say decentralized finance rails built on the blockchain could be a better answer. Especially as building on the current aging payment rails is expected to increasingly be a problem. This Finextra article notes, “as time goes by and the payments industry moves increasingly to micro, international, immediate payments with volumes that will be orders of magnitude greater than today, these problems will get a lot more visible.” “It’s definitely archaic at this point, and it is a pretty slow kind of method of moving money, but it is also the most prevalent and popular kind of payment network in the U.S. when you’re moving money from bank to bank. There is a bunch of innovation happening right now, so there is a real-time payment craze coming up,” Kote said, referencing the Federal Reserve’s new FedNow Service. It’s set to launch in July and promises faster payment rails for financial institutions."
231,Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain Base plans for 2023 mainnet launch,['@jacqmelinek'],"April 21, 2023"," Welcome back to Chain Reaction, a podcast that interviews newsmakers in crypto to better understand the tech behind the hype and the people working to build a decentralized future. For this week’s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Jesse Pollak, the lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase. Base is an Ethereum-focused layer 2 blockchain launched by Coinbase in February. Pollak previously led all retail engineering at Coinbase, including building Coinbase, Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Wallet. In a past life, Pollak started Clef, a 2FA mobile app, and was an engineer at BuzzFeed. The platform has been live in testnet, which is a test phase of the blockchain network, since late February. It isn’t sharing “official timelines,” but Pollak disclosed exclusively to TechCrunch that Base is planning for its mainnet launch in 2023. Mainnet is the fully live version of a blockchain on the main network (hence the name: mainnet). “It’s coming soon, we’re working hard on it,” Pollak said. “It’s our number one priority alongside decentralization goals and the rest of the year is really about making sure we get there as quickly as possible.” Base’s vision is to bring a million builders and a billion users on-chain through “easy to use” products on its platform, Pollak said. Coinbase has been building in the crypto economy for more than a decade, but Base hopes to derive some of that value for itself and plans to help products and activities expand on-chain over the next decade. “I think less about Base passing Coinbase and more about how Base plus Coinbase over the next decade are going to work together to bring those million developers [and] billions of users on-chain,” Pollak said. A number of crypto businesses, platforms, marketplaces and infrastructure firms have committed to building on Base, including: Blockdaemon, Chainlink, Etherscan, Quicknode, Aave, Animoca Brands, Dune, Nansen, Magic Eden, Pyth, Rainbow Wallet, Ribbon Finance, The Graph, Wormhole and Gelato, to name a handful. The near-term plan is to get Base to mainnet and decentralize it, Pollak said. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Pollak, “We can’t not decentralize this. We have to live up to that value and to that ethos.” Base hopes to become decentralized from Coinbase within “months or years” rather than a decade, Pollak said. The process of becoming decentralized “is not a forever timeline,” but rather a question of “how do we make progress on this today,” Pollak added. “When I wake up every morning and say p zero, how do we decentralize?” Of course, we talked a lot about Base on the podcast and where it’s headed in the future, as well as how regulation could affect the blockchain. We also dove into: The article mentioned during the episode can be found here. Chain Reaction comes out every other Thursday at 12:00 p.m. PT, so be sure to subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest in web3 and crypto."
232,GitHub slashes engineering team in India,['@refsrc'],"March 28, 2023","GitHub, the popular developer platform, has laid off virtually its entire engineering team in India as the Microsoft-owned firm cuts its expenses amid weakening global market conditions. The developer firm has eliminated over 100 jobs in the South Asian market, a person familiar with the matter said. GitHub informed the employees about the job cut on Tuesday. Gergely Orosz, a former software engineer who runs the newsletter Pragmatic Engineer, first reported the job cuts. A GitHub spokesperson told TechCrunch that the layoff is part of the streamlining effort the firm had disclosed in February. GitHub had said that it would cut roughly 10% of its workforce by the quarter ending in March. “As part of the reorganization plan shared in February, workforce reductions were made today as part of difficult but necessary decisions and realignments to both protect the health of our business in the short term and grant us the capacity to invest in our long-term strategy moving forward,” the spokesperson said. India is one of the world’s largest developer markets and a key engineering hub for many large companies."
233,Generative AI could transform the way we interact with enterprise software,['@ron_miller'],"April 8, 2023","Over the last several months, OpenAI, and ChatGPT in particular, has shown what’s possible with a user interface built on top of a large language model that can answer questions and create code or pictures. While that alone is remarkable, we can also interact with and adjust the byproduct by having a conversation of sorts with the AI. It’s amazing really, but think about how transformative this could be by applying it to the enterprise applications you use on a daily basis. What if you could build an interface on top of your existing applications, so that instead of pointing and clicking, you could simply ask the computer to do a task for you and it would do it, based on the applications’ underlying model or your company’s internal language model. That would be a huge leap forward in computing. Before now, the biggest leap happened in 1984, when Apple introduced the graphical user interface that began a slow shift from the command line approach and eventually went mainstream in the early ’90s with the release of Windows 3.1 and later Windows 95. We’ve had other UX attempts, such as voice interfaces like Siri and Alexa, and while they brought some changes to the consumer side of things, they’re still not exactly the same thing as a computer producing work for us. It’s just finding some answers and in some cases executing simple commands. It certainly didn’t change the way we work, and that is the true measure of whether a new computing approach is truly transformational. If you could simply type an action like “Help me onboard a new employee” or “Generate a monthly P&L statement” instead of explicitly guiding the systems on what to do, that would be a fundamental leap forward in UX design. That’s what generative AI has the potential to do, but like anything else, it’s going to require some creativity to design these new interfaces in an elegant way, so it doesn’t feel like it’s bolted on to your old point-and-click interface. It’s also probably going to require more-focused large language models."
234,How Mindbloom’s CEO sees the future of psychedelic mental health,['@Haje'],"March 27, 2023","“What was something amazing that happened to you this weekend,” Mindbloom’s CEO Dylan Beynon asked me, less than 30 seconds into our call. His bright eyes and relaxed demeanor radiated a deep peace and presence, paired with what seemed like a genuine care for the other person on the call — something that’s rare in an interview with a CEO. Sure, he was talking with a journalist to further Mindbloom’s mission, but he was modeling something that runs deep in the mental health startup’s DNA: being there for others. Beynon built Mindbloom after finding deep healing for himself in psychedelic medicine. For him, the journey started a few years ago when he experienced a facilitated MDMA treatment. Apart from wanting more people to experience the radical healing powers of promising medicines that were chased underground as collateral damage to the war on drugs in the 1980s, Beynon has seen the mental health medical machine failing people very close to home. “Mental health is the number one public health crisis, and depression is the number one cause of disability worldwide. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for people 18 to 35 and the number three cause of death for people 35 to 55,” Beynon rattled off the statistics, before the words got stuck in his throat. “My sister and my mother became fentanyl overdose statistics last year and the year before. This is deeply personal and meaningful to me. And when you look at the root cause of why we’re losing the fight to the mental health crisis … our existing treatment options just aren’t getting the job done.” Beynon’s sister and mother both had severe mental illnesses, Beynon said. Navigating the mental health options available to them was harder than finding more accessible relief in self-medicating with fentanyl. “My family was obliterated by mental illness. My mother was schizophrenic and an addict. My sister was schizophrenic and an addict. For both of them, we tried the traditional treatments: antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, anti-psychotics, one-on-one therapy, group therapy, in-patient rehab, out-patient rehab … Unfortunately, none of them worked well enough,” Beynon said. “My mother ended up spending 15 years homeless because we weren’t able to help her. My sister would have been homeless if she wasn’t sheltered by my father. She died of a fentanyl overdose after getting out of rehab last year.”"
235,UK regulators could be right about cloud portability obstacles,['@ron_miller'],"April 10, 2023","Last week, U.K. communications watchdog group Ofcom reported that it was investigating cloud infrastructure vendors — paying particular attention to Amazon and Microsoft — for making it too difficult to move workloads from public clouds. This raised a legitimate question about the obstacles to portability. The report pointed to three things in particular that Ofcom would investigate: egress fees, the payments these companies charge when customers want to move data from their platforms; general restrictions on interoperability and portability; and discounts they use to keep companies with large workloads on their platforms. Ofcom is investigating whether cloud vendors, especially the largest ones, have been deliberately putting up roadblocks to keep customers from changing vendors, giving consumers fewer options once they’ve committed to a particular seller. That could put smaller competitors at a distinct disadvantage. Typically, Ofcom looks at consumer issues like the cost of broadband, but it sees cloud computing as a public utility, where pricing has a direct impact on U.K. businesses. The inquiry suggests that U.K. authorities see a possibly deliberate attempt on the part of these companies to keep their customers in the fold. Of course, every company wants to keep its customers from churning. That in itself is not necessarily a problem, but if these companies are setting up systems to make it difficult for customers to switch, then that becomes an issue for groups like Ofcom. It’s worth noting that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission also announced an inquiry into public cloud vendors last month, asking for public comment on market power and security risks. It joins the EU, which launched an investigation into Microsoft last year. When we asked Microsoft and Amazon about the report, they both said they are working with Ofcom and are committed to a competitive market in the U.K. Yes, that’s all well and good and exactly what you would expect from the vendors, but do these groups investigating anticompetitive behavior have a point?"
236,YouTube TV nabs its first Technical Emmy win for ‘Views’ feature,['@laurenforristal'],"April 17, 2023","YouTube TV just won its first Technical Emmy award for its “Views” suite of features, which lets users access sports highlights, key plays, player stats and game scores. At the 74th annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards last night, YouTube TV was declared the winner for the category “AI-ML Curation of Sports Highlights.” “Thank you to the Academy for this recognition to Google. This is YouTube TV’s first ever Technology & Engineering Emmy Award, and we couldn’t be more proud of our team’s work on delivering Views for our members,” Kathryn Cochrane, YouTube TV’s group project manager, wrote in a company blog post. The tech company also announced today that Key Plays reached a notable milestone — the feature was used in over 10 million watch sessions on the platform. Last year, viewers used key plays the most during the World Cup, regular season NFL games and Premier League matches. The Key Plays view tracks important plays in a game. Users can tap on the plays to rewatch when it occurs in the game. This is helpful for users that missed a live game and want to catch up on key moments.  “Views came out of a team brainstorm about five years ago and launched about a year after YouTube TV,” Cochrane added. “A lot of our viewers are devoted sports fans, and we found that when they watch sports, they aren’t just looking at what’s on the big screen. They were also actively on their phones, finding more details such as stats for their fantasy football league, updates from other games, and more, all to enhance what they were already watching.” When YouTube TV launched Views in 2018, it was only available for baseball, basketball, football and hockey. Soccer and golf were added later on. The suite of features was also initially limited to phones and tablets. Today, the feature is available within the YouTube TV app across smart TVs and mobile devices. In addition to Stats, Key Plays and Scores View, there’s also Fantasy Football View, which is a mobile-only feature and lets users link their existing fantasy football account. That way, when a user is watching NFL games on YouTube TV, the feature allows them to see how their team is performing in real time. Plus, there’s a “Jump to” function for users to quickly access a segment they want to view, which is especially handy for tennis fans and for users watching the Olympics. Recently, YouTube TV launched a multiview feature for sports fans to watch four games at once. However, the feature is currently available to select users in the U.S.  "
237,a16z’s crypto report anticipates developer growth as blockchain scaling solutions expand,['@jacqmelinek'],"April 11, 2023"," As the crypto market continues to find its footing in an ever-shaky climate, Andreessen Horowtiz, which launched a $4.5 billion web3 fund last year, released its second State of Crypto report. It dives into everything from blockchain activity to new technologies, but one theme that stands out is that blockchains are scaling. The scaling momentum is up from a few years ago when tons of people were using blockchain networks, said Eddy Lazzarin, chief technology officer for a16z crypto. As a result, there was a lot of congestion, mainly on Ethereum, and gas fees were expensive. That time period convinced a lot of people that blockchain growth will come via scalability, Lazzarin noted, resulting in developers being excited to experiment and create new products. “So the effort over the past two years or more is to get scaling solutions off the ground, and now they’re actually working and live. There’s still more to be built, but they’re much cheaper, secure and they work. The momentum is now that developers can use them.” There are roughly 30,000 active developers in the crypto industry today, which is down from early 2022 peaks but up “well above” early 2021, according to the report."

Yes, Twitter’s homepage icon really is the doge meme right now.

The price of the pointless, meme-driven cryptocurrency Dogecoin is going up, though it’s still far lower than its peak price in May 2021. Musk is currently facing a $258 million racketeering lawsuit, which alleges that he ran a pyramid scheme to promote Dogecoin. Friday evening, Musk’s lawyers wrote in a filing with Manhattan’s federal court that his tweets were jokes. Of course, this is not the first time Musk’s lawyers have had to defend his tweets before the court. If Musk is trying to prove that his (not even funny) memes don’t impact the prices of cryptocurrencies, he’s not doing a great job. But perhaps a quick pump-and-dump scheme could net him more money than selling Twitter Blue subscriptions.  "
239,Is there really a march from the public cloud back on-prem?,['@ron_miller'],"April 16, 2023","It turns out that the cloud is expensive, and the more workloads you move to the cloud, the more it costs. Go figure. When we were in the “growth at all costs” phase between 2021 and 2022, it was easy to ignore or minimize the costs associated with operating in the cloud. But when companies started scrutinizing every entry in the technology budget, it became pretty clear that the cloud bills were big and only getting bigger, and maybe we should look for ways to lessen that budgetary impact. The brute force way would be to say, “let’s just move back on-prem!” But there are major questions about this approach. Why did you move to the cloud in the first place? Maybe you were thinking there would be cost savings. But even if you were wrong on that point, it’s the agility of the public cloud that has always been its primary value proposition. Think back for a second to the bad old days of on-prem, when you had to plan for capacity. If your company grew faster than you anticipated, you were pretty much stuck, putting your business in a very vulnerable position. The corporate procurement process has always been fraught with time-consuming bureaucracy. You have to plan to buy servers, then you need to rack and stack them. Even if you want to do that, do you still have the personnel with that skill set? Chances are you’ve been hiring for a cloud DevOps world. While it’s possible to move certain workloads with less pain than others, consider that earlier this month, Ofcom, a U.K. communications watchdog, issued a report criticizing the top cloud infrastructure players for making it too hard to move workloads between clouds — and presumably back on-prem, if that was the desire. If it’s truly so expensive and difficult, how does it make sense for companies to do that? I decided to explore if companies really want to move back on-prem. I asked a group of industry experts about it, and while I got a decidedly mixed set of answers, it seems that the cloud repatriation idea is being greatly exaggerated. Let’s start with the fact that the cloud infrastructure market is huge, even as it’s slowing down amid the economic uncertainties affecting every industry. The market reached over $200 billion in 2022. The fourth quarter was up 21% to $61 billion, per Synergy Research. While it was down from the prior year, when the market grew at 36%, it was still a substantial market by any measure. “From a numbers perspective, we continue to see strong growth in the cloud market — 2022 worldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services was up 26% from 2021, despite problems in China and a much-strengthened U.S. dollar — while investment in enterprise on-prem infrastructure remains weak,” John Dinsdale, chief analyst and research director at Synergy Research, told TechCrunch+. “Servers shipped to enterprises grew by 3% in 2022. Looking ahead, we continue to forecast strong growth in the cloud market and weak growth in on-prem infrastructure.”"

You can help TechCrunch win by voting for Chain Reaction, which digs into the wild world of crypto, or Found, which brings you the stories behind the startups by sitting down with the founders themselves. Please take a few moments to vote here. Voting closes April 20. (NB: I host Chain Reaction, so vote for my show!) Welcome back to Chain Reaction, a podcast that interviews newsmakers in crypto to better understand the tech behind the hype and the people working to build a decentralized future. For this week’s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Arianna Simpson, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (commonly known as a16z). Prior to joining a16z, Arianna founded Autonomous Partners, an investment fund focused on crypto. She also helped launch Crystal Towers Capital, an early-stage fund investing primarily in YC companies. A16z has dug deep into the crypto space after launching four funds dedicated to the industry. The most recent one closed at $4.5 billion in May 2022, and Arianna thinks it’s appropriate, given the size of the opportunity. “I certainly think the ecosystem has grown to a size where it absolutely supports a fund of this size and that’s why we raised a fund of this size,” Simpson said. “We didn’t have to raise any number; we chose a number that we thought spoke to the size of the opportunity. The ecosystem has obviously grown tremendously and is continuing to attract tons of early-stage entrepreneurs who are building across the board.” When asked if there would be a fifth crypto fund from a16z, Simpson said, “I certainly hope so.” She added a16z will “continue to tailor our fund sizes to opportunities we see in the market.” Some of the firm’s portfolio companies include big crypto players we’ve interviewed in the past, like Alchemy, Avalanche and Aptos. Over the years, there’s been an expansion of investment opportunities “into a whole new world of consumer applications, experiences and products that just weren’t possible because they couldn’t run on blockchains a few years ago, and now they are,” Simpson said. “To me, that’s what’s really exciting: there’s this whole world of applications that can be used by consumers.” We talked about Simpson’s background, how her strategy has changed over the years, what she looks for in founders and whether she would launch another VC firm in the future.

242,Apple TV rolls out multiview feature in beta to sports fans,['@laurenforristal'],"April 14, 2023","The rumors going around about Apple TV developing a multiview feature (spotted by developer Steve Moser) are coming true. Tonight, Apple is launching a beta version of the feature on the Apple TV 4K during its MLB Friday Night Baseball livestream, TechCrunch has learned. Users participating in the Apple beta software program must have tvOS beta version 16.5, which can be downloaded by going to the Settings app and selecting “System,” “Software Updates” and then “Get Beta Updates.” Apple hasn’t officially announced when multiview will become widely available. There’s no exact timeline yet for when tvOS 16.5 will officially be out of beta. As first reported by Tom’s Guide, the beta feature is currently limited to Apple’s sports offerings — MLS Season Pass and MLB Friday Night Baseball. The feature will be available for MLS fans tomorrow when Matchday 8 commences at 7:30 p.m. ET. With multiview, users will be able to watch up to four games at once, which is displayed in a grid format on the screen. To use the feature, viewers can start watching their game of choice and then select the “Add Game” button. The multiviewing experience is customizable in many ways — so we’ve learned — and allows fans to move games around the screen, making one game larger than the others or choosing to watch either two or four evenly split screens. If a user wants one game to take up the majority of the screen, the other games are then stacked on the right. Fans can also switch between audio via the remote, so they’re able to control which game they want to hear. Similarly, YouTube TV is also testing a limited multiview feature that’s available for only a select number of U.S. users.   Apple’s Friday Night Baseball games are included in the $6.99/month Apple TV+ subscription. However, consumers have to pay $12.99 or $14.99 per month for MLS Season Pass, depending on whether they’re Apple TV+ subscribers. Unlike Friday Night Baseball, which killed its free offering this year, MLS Season Pass allows non-subscribers to watch a few MLS matches for free. For Matchday 8, there will be five games that fans can watch without signing up for the subscription. This includes Charlotte vs Colorado, Columbus vs New England, Minnesota vs Orlando , Toronto vs Atlanta and San Jose vs Kansas City."
243,The ice-breaking IPO we’ve waited for might not come from the US after all,['@alex'],"May 1, 2023","British semiconductor giant Arm is heading back to the public markets after more than five years of private life. Even better, the company’s note announcing that it filed privately to go public — a draft F-1 listing, in other words — said that it may list in the United States. Why get so excited about it? Well, the news means Arm could be the dam-breaking domestic IPO we’ve long been waiting for. The American tech IPO market is currently dead in the water and in need of a champion to brave the unknown, and if Arm’s offering performs well, it could encourage other companies to go public, too. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. We’ve covered this before, but to jog your memory: After a busy 2020 and 2021, American tech companies in 2022 suddenly found themselves in a changing market that generally preferred lower valuations for public tech stocks. That resulted in a nigh-complete halt of new IPOs in the U.S. from both domestic tech companies and international firms. This perceived dearth of liquidity in the public markets is one reason why the value of startup exits in recent years has fallen so sharply. The lack of exits through IPOs, a historically critical avenue for founders, employees and investors to derive returns, means that a host of richly valued tech startups are stuck between a receding late-stage private capital market and an indifferent, if not downright hostile, public market. Arm could change all that and do it in style. Recall that we anticipated that the Arm offering could raise as much as $8 billion. In terms of priming the pump, that’s a lot of primer. What could Arm be worth in its listing? Reuters cites some sources who expect a valuation of above $50 billion, or a little more than two OpenAIs. If that sounds high, keep in mind that last February, Nvidia called off a $40 billion attempt to purchase Arm. Sure, valuations were a bit higher in early 2022 than they are today, but does anyone think that semiconductor chips have become less important since then?"
244,NPR leaves Twitter due to misleading ‘government-funded media’ label,['@asilbwrites'],"April 12, 2023","NPR will no longer update its 52 Twitter accounts, including the primary @NPR handle, which has nearly 9 million followers. These accounts include NPR’s topic-specific feeds like NPR Politics, as well as individual radio shows like Weekend Edition. Last week, Twitter placed a “state-affiliated media” label on NPR’s account, representing the American news nonprofit in the same way that it denotes RT, Russia’s state-backed mouthpiece that pushes the Kremlin’s talking points to the broader world. But the U.S. government does not have any sort of editorial control over NPR, and the news organization only received about 1% of its budget from federal funding in 2020. The label on NPR’s account was amended to “government-funded media,” yet NPR representatives have stated that this description is still misleading. “At this point I have lost my faith in the decision-making at Twitter,” NPR CEO John Lansing told an NPR reporter. “I would need some time to understand whether Twitter can be trusted again.” pic.twitter.com/OLgOHvTlma — NPR (@NPR) April 12, 2023  According to Twitter, the “government-funded” label applies to any news outlet receiving “some or all” funding from the government, which “may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content.” Twitter also assigned this label to the BBC. Twitter owner Elon Musk has targeted mainstream media outlets like The New York Times, stripping the account — followed by 55 million people — of its verified checkmark. All verified accounts that do not subscribe to Twitter Blue are expected to lose their checkmark by April 20 (delayed from April1), but the social platform took extra care to remove The New York Times’ badge as soon as possible. This makes it very easy for users to impersonate the major news source, and can also spark confusion around whether this account is real.  "
245,"Slowly but surely, data is helping VCs look beyond networks for sourcing deals",['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 5, 2023","Venture capital has traditionally been an industry that revolves around relationships. VCs invest in a startup’s idea but their conviction stems from the folks behind it. This largely makes sense because investing in a startup also usually entails entering a years-long relationship. But backing companies based on the allure of the founder hasn’t always worked out. Indeed, it often gets investors tied up in companies destined to collapse for one reason or another. And depending on warm intros or networks also limits the amount of startups an investor considers, which further alienates founders who don’t have the same networks or hail from nontraditional backgrounds. An increasing number of venture firms think the solution to cutting through the noise is by incorporating data science into their deal sourcing process. This wouldn’t be a crazy idea per se, as investors from other asset classes such as institutional investors, hedge funds and public market traders already embrace data-driven investing, but thus far venture has largely sat out of the conversation. Our belief is that this is one of those things where if you haven’t started to do it, you’ll be left behind.
Mark Sherman, managing partner, Telstra Ventures A few venture firms, such as Correlation Ventures, SignalFire and Rocketship.vc, have long taken this approach, but this number looks likely to grow. This week, Austin, Texas-based VC outlet Ensemble announced that it closed a $100 million debut fund to invest in early-stage startups using a data-driven approach that sorts and tracks companies based on the quality and depth of their entire team. Ensemble’s co-founder and managing partner, Collin West — an alum of Correlation Ventures — told TechCrunch that the firm wants to back companies that have the strongest team, but that would be too difficult to track without using data science to pare the list down. “Using software, we can track all of the people at all of the startups, and that ends up being a whole lot more information than any human brain can handle, and especially any venture firm,” West said. “We effectively sort the industry by team quality in a very objective way knowing which companies to focus on, and spend a lot more time on fewer companies.”"
246,Instagram now lets you bookmark posts with friends and store them in a dedicated space,['@aiishamalik1'],"March 29, 2023","Back in 2017, Instagram launched a bookmarking feature called “collections,” which allows users to organize the posts they save into private groupings for easier access. Now, Instagram is introducing a new feature that lets users create collections with their friends. The social network told TechCrunch in an email that it’s rolling out “collaborative collections,” a way for people to connect with friends over their shared interests by saving posts to a collaborative collection in their group chat or a one-on-one DM. In other words, you can now share posts with a friend or a group of friends and save them in a dedicated space. The new feature could be seen as a way for Instagram to rival Pinterest, which has offered a “Group boards” feature since 2018, letting users collaborate with each other on the platform. “Now when you go to save a piece of content on Feed or from your DMs, you’ll see a new option to create a collaborative collection,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri said on Wednesday in the IG Updates Channel on Instagram. “From there you can give the collection a custom name and share the collection with your friends. Once they receive it, your friends can start adding content from reels, Explore, Feed and DMs to the collection as well.” Image Credits: Instagram Image Credits: Instagram Any member of the chat can add or remove posts from the collection. Users also have the option to add directly to a collaborative collection posts shared in a chat. If there is a post in a chat that you want to add to a collaborative collection, you can tap the bookmark icon that appears next to the post and then either add it to a current collaborative collection or create a new one. Collaborative collections is a welcome addition to the platform and has numerous use cases. For instance, the feature could be used to help a group of friends plan a trip by allowing them to save posts of places they want to see or things they want to try when visiting a new place. Or, collaborative collections could be used for day-to-day things like curating a dedicated space where you and your friends can share posts about your mutual interests, such as memes, baking recipes, workout tips, craft ideas and more. The launch of the new feature comes as Instagram recently introduced a new way for users to connect with others on the social media platform. Last month, the company rolled out a new broadcast chat feature on Instagram called “Channels.” The feature lets creators share public, one-to-many messages to directly engage with their followers. Channels support text, images, polls, reactions and more. Earlier this month, the social network began testing a new feature that lets users quickly access your recently shared reels in order to make it easier for users to reshare a reel they liked to another friend at a later time.

247,Web3 protocol Polytrade raises $3.8M to improve global trade,['@jacqmelinek'],"March 30, 2023"," Polytrade, a web3 protocol focused on global trade, has raised $3.8 million in a seed round led by Alpha Wave, Matrix Partners, Polygon Ventures and CoinSwitch Ventures, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include Singularity Ventures and GTM Ventures. The firm has previously been backed by Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal and QuickSwap co-founder Sameep Singhania, among others. The protocol aims to streamline supply chains through real-time data, Piyush Gupta, founder and CEO of Polytrade, said to TechCrunch. “The biggest challenge in the global supply chain is the lack of transparency,” Gupta said. “The manual processes, the paperwork; you would be surprised if you submit a document in a bank in India, they still ask you to sign the document with an ink-based signature […] it’s a lot of manual labor.” Its initial modules include a financing arm that brings real-world yields onto web3. The platform aims to provide small and midsize enterprises and large corporations with access to working capital financing and invoices. The platform has had about 2 million invoices to date, Gupta shared. In 2023, it expects its trade financing book size to touch $50 million, he said. Next year, it’s looking at liquidity of $200 million into its lending protocol, and all trading ecosystem volume should cross $1 billion, he added. While the platform is open to the retail market, its main focus is on institutional players because they are more long-term oriented, Gupta said. The company also wants to expand in Latin American, U.S. and European markets, Gupta said. Polytrade plans to continue building “various models to bring the entire trading supply system onto the blockchain,” he added. “My single focus is to bring every single trade document, trade financial players and trade counterparties on chain, so that everybody can go to one blockchain page and know everything about a particular buyer or supplier.”"
248,Samsung bans use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT after April internal data leak,['@kateparknews'],"May 2, 2023","A month after internal, sensitive data from Samsung was accidentally leaked to ChatGPT, Samsung is cracking down on usage of the generative AI service. The electronics giant is temporarily restricting the use of generative AI tools on company-owned devices, covering computers, tablets and phones, as well as non-company-owned devices running on internal networks. The ban would cover not just ChatGPT, but services that use the technology like Microsoft’s Bing, as well as competing generative AI services like Bard from Google. The ban was initially reported by Bloomberg. The rule, which took effect on 1 May, would only apply to devices issued by Samsung to its workers — meaning consumers and others that own Samsung phones, laptops and other connected devices would not be impacted. “The company is reviewing measures to create a secure environment for safely using generative AI to enhance employees’ productivity and efficiency,” a spokesperson at Samsung told TechCrunch. “However, until these measures are ready, we are temporarily restricting the use of generative AI through company devices.” According to a memo from Monday seen by Bloomberg, the restriction would be temporary, lasting until it builds “security measures to create a secure environment for safely using generative AI to enhance employees’ productivity and efficiency.” The South Korea-headquartered tech firm is said to be developing its own in-house AI tools for “software development and translation,” according to the report. OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot ChatGPT has gained massive popularity worldwide since its launch last November, with people leaning on it to give them text-based answers to everything from basic research to tasks related to business and more. But some of that boon in the field of AI is meeting significant roadblocks. In addition to proprietary data leaking to the service as it did with Samsung last month, others have flagged potential violations of data privacy, copyright violations and inaccuracy in ChatGPT’s responses. The tech giant initially allowed employees at its device solutions (DS) division, which manages its semiconductor and display businesses, to use generative AI from March 11. In the aftermath of the data leak, Samsung also asked staff using generative AI tools elsewhere “not to submit any company-related information or personal data,” which could disclose its intellectual property, according to the memo reviewed by Bloomberg. One of the issues that Samsung noted is that it is difficult to “retrieve and delete” the data on external servers, and the data transmitted to such AI tools could be disclosed to other users. Based on Samsung’s internal survey in April, about 65% of participants said using generative AI tools carries a security risk. OpenAI has been working to fix some of the more controversial issues to remove some of the more high-profile bans. Most recently, ChatGPT services were resumed in Italy after OpenAI unveiled a plan to introduce new privacy controls. Major banks, including Bank of America, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, are among the other businesses that have recently restricted employees’ use of ChatGPT. In South Korea, other large tech companies, including LG and memory chip maker SK Hynix, are struggling to make their own guidelines for using generative AI tools.

249,Apple tvOS 16.4 update gives light-sensitive users a ‘Dim Flashing Lights’ feature,['@laurenforristal'],"March 28, 2023","Apple released the tvOS 16.4 update to the public yesterday, bringing various improvements to the system, including a new “Dim Flashing Light” feature. The new accessibility option can detect flashes of light or strobe effects and then automatically dim the display of a video. The “Dim Flashing Light” feature is notable as it will likely benefit Apple TV users with light sensitivity or, possibly, users with epileptic seizures. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, 2.7 million Americans have epilepsy, and approximately 3-5% of them are photosensitive. Photosensitive epilepsy is when seizures are triggered by flashing lights, patterns or color changes. Flashing lights can also cause headaches and migraines. The tvOS update is available for the Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD. It can be installed manually by going to “Settings,” “System” and then “Software Update.” If your Apple TV is set to update automatically, then it should be downloaded already. The other updates weren’t as significant but included some performance and stability improvements. Apple rolled out the tvOS 16.4 update shortly after tvOS 16.3.3, which fixed a bug that caused some Siri remotes to randomly disconnect from the Apple TV. When Apple released a new version of the Apple TV 4K in November 2022, there were customers that reported connectivity issues with the Siri remote. According to a Reddit user, the remote would disconnect from the Apple TV without explanation and would only work again if they did a full restart of their TV."
250,Qualcomm-backed Aravita wants to help Brazilian supermarkets control food waste,['@christinemhall'],"March 30, 2023","It’s estimated that about a third of all food produced worldwide every year, which is approximately 1.3 billion tons, is estimated to be wasted. Aravita, a Brazilian artificial intelligence startup, thinks that supermarkets are the best place to start fixing this problem. Marco Perlman, co-founder and CEO, started the company with Aline Azevedo and Bruno Schrappe in 2022 to tackle waste in the fourth-largest food producing country in the world where 33 million Brazilians have some type of food insecurity. Aravita is developing an AI-powered solution for supermarkets that looks at variables, including climate, seasonality, consumer behavior and economic scenario, to manage the purchasing of fresh food — mainly fruits and vegetables — to reduce the instances of surplus items and lost sales due to waste. At the same time, the software increases the availability of items in demand. “Supermarkets are our target audience because they are a great place to drive the first wedge of data availability,” Perlman told TechCrunch. “They have point-of-sale consumer data, and this is the data that we need to start making the predictions for low-demand forecasting. Unlike other parts of the supply chain, where the data is much harder to get a hold of, eventually we think that this will be digitized.” Aravita is still in the very early stages: It has a conceptual prototype and started a pilot with a mid-sized supermarket chain near São Paulo and has the first set of algorithms developed. It is also in the process of integrating the first database of historical data into that model. However, that first pilot didn’t come easy. Perlman recalls that potential customers were initially worried that startups were “having difficulty raising money, hiring and surviving,” and were uncomfortable giving store data to a company without financial resources that could stick around. Aravita co-founders, Marco Perlman, Aline Azevedo and Bruno Schrappe. Image Credits: Aravita Aravita co-founders, Marco Perlman, Aline Azevedo and Bruno Schrappe. Image Credits: Aravita So the trio started reaching out to investors and was able to secure a $2.5 million investment earlier this year, co-led by Qualcomm Ventures and 17Sigma. “Fresh food management is highly fragmented and complex,” said Michel Glezer, director of Qualcomm Wireless GmbH and director at Qualcomm Ventures, in a written statement. “Aravita’s solution enables retailers to optimize inventory management, helping increase efficiencies and reduce waste.” Joining those two firms were Bridge, DGF Investimentos, Alexia Ventures, BigBets, Norte Capital and a group of angel investors, including ClearSale partner and CEO Bernardo Lustosa and Flávio Jansen, former CEO of LocaWeb and Submarino. Aravita is now in good company among other startups tackling food waste that also recently attracted venture capital, including Divert, which is trying to stop food before it reaches landfills; Diferente, also in Brazil, that is finding places for imperfect produce; and food resale app Recelery. They join other companies like Shelf Engine, Apeel, OLIO, Imperfect Foods, Mori and Phood Solutions. The next steps are to develop the solution over the next few months and add a second pilot customer, Perlman said. He expects to have product-market fit next year and the ability to “step on the gas to accelerate” Aravita’s business model into other supermarket departments, including baked goods, pastry, cold cuts, fish and meat. The new capital enables the company to hire additional employees and for future innovation, including inventory management, point-of-sale integration and technology development like AI and computer vision for process automation.

251,Blockchain builder Ava Labs partners with Korea’s SK Planet to expand Asia footprint,['@kateparknews'],"April 5, 2023","Ava Labs, a company that launched the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, has partnered with SK Planet, a data management and marketing platform unit of South Korean company SK Square. SK Planet will launch Avalanche Subnet UPTN to offer web3 infrastructure in South Korea.  The partnership comes less than a month after the New York-based digital asset firm hired its first new heads in Asia in service of accelerating its footprint in the region. The move also follows Ava Labs’ partnership with Tencent Cloud in February to help scale blockchain adoption across traditional enterprises.  Ava Labs has worked with the developer community in South Korea for years to help them understand and build on the Avalanche network, John Nahas, vice president of business development at Ava Labs, told TechCrunch. Still, the latest partnership with SK Planet will be a cornerstone of its strategy in the region, Nahas added.  “This is our first marquee partnership with a top South Korean enterprise, and the partnership will be a cornerstone of our growth plans in the market,” Nahas said to TechCrunch.  SK Square, the parent company of SK Planet, was spun off from South Korean telco giant SK Telecom. Just last week, Ava Labs sealed a partnership deal with SK Planet and hosted an Avalanche Day with Korean developers and other partners.  SK Planet is launching its Avalanche Subnet, UPTN, and will start deploying numerous SK applications and services on the Subnet, Nahas said, adding that potential additional Subnets are forthcoming. The Avalanche Subnet UPTN will let SK Planet customers and merchants use digital collectibles, web3 wallets, decentralized communities and more.  One such application is SK Planets’ OK Cashbag, a membership reward program enabling customers to earn points via using the OK Cashbag app. Customers can use the points as cash across retail shops, from restaurants to hotels, movie theaters, retail financial apps and more. SK Planet claims it has tens of millions of OK Cashbag users, nearly half the South Korean population, and works with 90,000 merchant partners.  “The UPTN will serve as the platform for the web3 initiative of all apps of SK’s information and communication technology (ICT) business division and will also be the managed service provider (MSP) for infrastructure in NFT mining, web3 community growth and management — similar to Avalanche’s recent Shopify/Venly and TYB partnerships,” Nahas continued. Avalanche has more than 100 Subnets currently under development and in the test phase. Its Subnets allow individuals and enterprises to build customized, app-specific blockchains for their use cases.  “Ava Labs is fully committed to supporting South Korea’s buyers and merchants as they explore the unique benefits of the Avalanche ecosystem,” said Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs, in a statement. “We see this new partnership between Ava Labs, the Avalanche Foundation, and SK Planet as an incredible opportunity to not only meet South Korea’s enormous appetite for Web3 experiences but expand what’s possible in 21st-century e-commerce.”     "
252,Apple is reportedly developing an AI-powered health coaching service,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 25, 2023","Apple is developing an AI-powered health coaching service code named Quartz, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The tech giant is reportedly also working on technology for tracking emotions and plans to roll out an iPad version of the iPhone Health app this year. The AI-powered health coaching service is designed to help users stay motivated to exercise, improve their eating habits and sleep better. The idea behind the service is to use AI and information from a user’s Apple Watch to develop coaching programs specially tailored for them. As with Apple’s other services, the health coaching service is expected to have a monthly fee. Several teams at Apple are reportedly working on the project, including the company’s health, Siri and AI teams. Gurman writes that the service is planned for next year but notes that it could be postponed or shelved altogether. In addition, the report says Apple’s Health app will be getting tools for tracking emotions and managing vision conditions, such as nearsightedness. The launch version of the emotion tracker will allow users to log their mood, answer questions about their day and compare their results over time. In the future, Apple reportedly hopes the mood tracker will be able to use algorithms to understand a user’s mood based on their speech, text and other data. As for the new iPad Health app, Gurman writes that Apple is going to unveil it at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. The launch of the app will allow users to see their health data, such as electrocardiogram results, on a larger screen. The new app is expected to be included in iPadOS 17, which is expected to launch later this year. As noted by Gurman, Apple began its health efforts back in 2014 when it launched the dedicated Health app and then launched the Apple Watch a year later. Since then, Apple has added several health features to its smartwatch, including fall detection and sleep tracking. The company’s upcoming mixed-reality headset is said to expand on Apple’s current health efforts, as it will reportedly include a feature that will allow users to meditate while wearing the device. Apple is expected to unveil the headset at WWDC. Apple is also planning to expand its health features by introducing a basic form of blood-pressure monitoring to the Apple Watch in the next few years, as previously reported by Bloomberg. Although the feature isn’t expected to display exact diastolic and systolic numbers, it will notify users if it senses they might have hypertension. In addition, the company is working on noninvasive glucose monitoring technology that would rely on sensors as opposed to finger pricks when it comes to taking a blood-sugar reading. Apple is reportedly working to put the technology into a small device, but eventually aims to add the technology to its Apple Watch.  "

254,Children’s data feared stolen in Fortra ransomware attack,['@carlypage_'],"March 28, 2023","The fallout from Fortra’s mass ransomware attack continues to widen as the hackers claim a new victim: a children’s virtual mental health care startup. In a data breach disclosure filed with the Maine attorney general’s office, U.S. healthcare giant Blue Shield of California confirmed that one of its providers, Brightline, had data stolen from data stored in its GoAnywhere file transfer tool. Brightline, which provides virtual coaching and therapy to children, was identified by TechCrunch last week as a likely victim of the mass breach. The breach notification confirmed that hackers — presumably the Russia-linked Clop ransomware gang that claimed to have breached over a hundred organizations by using an undisclosed security flaw — accessed and potentially exfiltrated the personal data of more than 63,000 patients. Clop’s dark web leak site, which the gang uses to publish the stolen files unless a ransom is paid, says that the gang will leak the data stolen from Brightline “soon.” Brightline has yet to publicly acknowledge the breach, either on its website or social media channels. Brightline spokesperson John O’Connor declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions, but did not dispute that the breach affects 63,000 individuals. It’s unclear how many of Brightline’s child users are affected. In its breach notification, Blue Shield said that the breach affected includes patient names, addresses, dates of birth, gender, Blue Shield subscriber ID numbers, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, plan names and plan group numbers. Brightline is said to be one of 130 organizations hit by the Clop group, but not the only healthcare company. US Wellness, which offers corporate health and wellness programs, also confirmed that hackers had accessed the personal data of its users, including names, addresses, dates of birth and member ID numbers. The impact of the Fortra vulnerability on healthcare organizations is so widespread that it prompted the U.S. government’s health sector cybersecurity coordination center — or HC3 —  to issue a warning in February to help safeguard against Clop’s attacks. Outside of healthcare organizations, the group’s ever-growing list of known victims includes the City of Toronto, Canadian financing giant Investissement Québec and Virgin Red. Jodie Burton, a spokesperson for Virgin Red, told TechCrunch that it learned that attackers had “illegally obtained some Virgin Red files via a cyber-attack on our supplier, GoAnywhere” after being contacted by Clop. TechCrunch has heard from other victims that they, too, only learned that data had been stolen after receiving a ransom demand — despite Fortra having assured them that their data was safe. Fortra spokespeople Mike Devine and Rachel Woodford have repeatedly declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions. Anne Hart, who represents Brightline on behalf of crisis communications firm Prosek, declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch. Updated on April 1 with remarks via Prosek.  "
255,New funding helps CarmaCare accelerate its ‘healthcare-for-your-car’ service,['@christinemhall'],"April 4, 2023","Point-of-sale at the car dealership or robo calls asking you to pay for an extended warranty are what consumers are most used to. Meanwhile, traditional insurance is mainly for collisions, but what happens when a belt breaks or you push the “start” button and nothing happens? That’s where a new startup wants to change the way you care for your car. Aptly named, CarmaCare launched its proprietary “healthcare-for-your-car” subscription service three months ago to take over where traditional car insurance leaves off and to provide an easier way to buy extended warranties. The company, founded in 2021 by Jonathan Palan, who previously founded AutoFi and was an executive at LendingClub and Kiavi, is now supported by $4.5 million in new funding raised at the end of 2022. In addition to the funding, the company announced that it has a new CEO, Jamie Ahern, who was previously with LearnVest and former chief operating officer of Kin Insurance. CarmaCare is innovating in the $35 billion car warranty and service contract industry that Ahern described as “predatory in nature.” “Wear-and-tear failures are 15 times more likely, but insurance is not designed to handle those, which opens up a huge need to handle these,” Ahern told TechCrunch. Here’s how CarmaCare works: Its vehicle service plans work by limiting the cost of repairs due to mechanical failures and also include roadside assistance and support for unexpected breakdowns. Users can choose between a $100 and $250 deductible for covered repairs that include, for example, replacement parts and powertrain, electronic, and mechanical components. Users also have access to the “Virtual Garage” feature, which Ahern explained can provide repair triaging and unbiased opinions on the cost of needed repairs. With interest rates rising on both new and used cars amid inflation, he said that this is more of an incentive for someone to keep their existing car on the road longer. “People are often afraid to take their car to the shop due to a feeling of being taken advantage of,” Ahern said. “Virtual Garage is like ‘TeleDoc for your car,’ and now that most people have technology-connected cars, often an experienced mechanic can tell what is going on and give estimates. Now when you go to the garage, you can tell them what might be the problem and the estimate, so if the mechanic quotes you something quite higher, you have information to help.” The capital infusion was led by Inspired Capital and included Twelve Below, Revelry and 81 Collection. The company intends to invest in its product and technology team and in customer acquisition strategies and hiring underwriters and data scientists. “With nearly half of Americans falling into debt over car repairs, the need for a consumer-friendly company like CarmaCare has never been greater,” said Mark Batsiyan, partner at Inspired Capital, in a written statement. “Both Jonathan and Jamie are seasoned operators who deeply understand the consumer need for a better solution.” Meanwhile, the company is still in the early stages. It has some revenue, but since its product just launched three months ago, Ahern declined to disclose growth metrics other than to say “early traction has exceeded expectations.” CarmaCare is currently direct-to-consumer, but Ahern said there are opportunities to pursue in B2B2C, and the company is in talks with companies and other partners. It is also looking to raise a small debt facility to begin financing customers and other new products.  "
256,"Ukrainian startup Zeely raises $1M for SMB growth app aimed at US, UK, Brazil, Mexico",['@mikebutcher'],"April 12, 2023","As Gen Z turns into their early-to-mid 20s, a new generation of business owners is coming online. Many of these new entrepreneurs do the vast majority of work on their phones. This is especially true in emerging markets like Latin America, where SMEs comprise 99.5% of firms in the region. In Mexico, for instance, 97.4% of businesses are micro-enterprises. But although small businesses are generally considered to be the primary driver of new job growth, few have the technical capability to spin up decent branding and an online presence. While platforms such as Wix and Squarespace have made it easier to do this, these are primarily aimed at desktop users. This is perhaps why, with Gen Z coming on stream, we are now seeing mobile-first startups appear to cater to this new wave of businesses. Thus we’ve seen the funding of mobile-first website builder Univer.se, which raised $47 million from Google Ventures, General Catalyst and Addition. Now joining them in this space is Zeely, a Ukrainian startup that came onto the tech radar during the controversy at Slush last year. Zeely’s offering has now caught the eye of investors into its new $1 million seed round. New backers include Ukrainian VC Vesna.Capital, Angel One Fund (a Ukrainian fund), Imaguru Ventures and angels Murat Abdrakhmanov (an investor in Udemy), Adrian J. Slywotzky (a partner at Oliver Wyman) and ZAS Ventures. Zeely’s app is aimed at helping small businesses grow fast. Image Credits: Zeely Zeely’s app is aimed at helping small businesses grow fast. Image Credits: Zeely Zeely plans to use this new investment to implement its integration with TikTok and payment systems and the expansion of their AI’s capabilities. The company claims it will reach an ARR of $3 million this year. Zeely says that its app can generate a web store quickly on a mobile, as well as allow a business to promote itself across social media platforms quickly and easily. It claims its AI-driven platform can automatically generate text and visual content for web stores and ad creatives, as well as analytics and client-management tools. Zeely’s users are so far spread across the U.S., U.K. and emerging markets such as Brazil and Mexico. It says, typically, the app is used by companies in the service sector such as beauty and care, car detailing, coaching, home care, along with retailers and merchants. A monthly subscription price starts at $19.99, however, says co-founder Alina Bondarenko (CCO): “Most of our Latin American users opt for the free version of our product, which offers a lot of functionality. In the future, we plan to introduce more affordable pricing plans for the LatAm market. Currently, 80% of our paying users are from the U.S. and U.K.” Zeely is currently testing a beta version of Stripe’s API integration to enable users to accept various modes of payments. “Other platforms tend to have drag-and-drop website builder’s but these often lack promotional tools, which we believe are crucial for generating customers. We provide our users with the ability to advertise through Facebook, Instagram, and other channels — all from their mobile devices in minutes,” added Bondarenko. Zeely’s team of 11 consists of Bondarenko and co-founders Dmytro Samoiliuk (CEO) and Yaroslav Samoiliuk (COO). Dmytro, the technical founder and CEO of Zeely, previously ran a digital marketing agency in Ukraine. Investor Murat Abdrakhmanov said in a statement: “I am glad to join the ambitious and very professional Zeely app team. It’s a great product and already has very convincing traction.”"

258,Volvo Cars Tech Fund invests in driver monitoring startup CorrActions,['@fredericl'],"April 24, 2023","CorrActions, an Israeli startup that, among other things, built a driver monitoring system that can understand a driver’s cognitive state, today announced that it has raised a strategic investment from Volvo Cars Tech Fund. According to the company, the target for this round is $6 million. The idea behind CorrActions is to use sensors that are already built into the car to monitor the driver’s micro muscle movements. These movements, the company argues, can reflect brain activity that CorrActions’ algorithms can then evaluate to check if the driver is tired, distracted or intoxicated. Simply using a cell phone and watching users interact with an app, CorrActions CEO Ilan Reingold told me during a meeting in Israel earlier this year, the company can determine blood alcohol levels with 90% accuracy and zero false positives (CorrActions previously worked with Volkswagen on a POC for this). Image Credits: CorrActions Image Credits: CorrActions “Today, we’re working with several OEMs and large fleet managers to monitor the capabilities of the person behind the wheel,” Reingold noted, but he also stressed that companies building autonomous driving fleets could use this system to monitor the motion sickness level of passengers, for example, to manage how the car drives to ensure that passengers feel comfortable. That, however, would be powered by a camera-based system or millimeter wave radar. Currently, the company mostly works with data from steering wheel sensors and pressure-based seat sensors, as well as motion data from apps used by fleet managers to communicate with their drivers. “With the Tech Fund, we aim to be a strategic partner of choice for exciting startups that can help boost our position as a tech leader in our industry,” said Alexander Petrofski, head of the Volvo Cars Tech Fund. “CorrActions fits the bill perfectly and focuses on a mission that is close to our heart: making cars and traffic safer.” Volvo notes that the company’s EX90 flagship electric SUV already includes numerous systems to understand a driver’s cognitive state. “The CorrActions technology is a highly relevant complement to our driver understanding system. As a result, we’ve decided to take a stake in CorrActions to support the further development and commercialization of its technology,” Volvo Cars Tech Fund explains in the funding announcement. Founded in 2019 by neuropsychologist Elad Hochman and business executive Zvi Ginosar in 2019, the company previously raised a $2.7 million seed round in 2021. The company brought on Reingold, who previously held a number of executive and R&D roles at various startups and large enterprises like Broadcom and Sony, in June 2022 to take the CEO role.  "
259,Krisp expands from noise canceling to on-device transcription,['@techcrunch'],"March 28, 2023","Krisp got its start as an AI-powered noise-cancellation service, but now the startup is moving beyond that with instant on-device transcription of all your calls and meetings — and of course it integrates ChatGPT now for quick summaries as well. The open beta goes live today. My transcribing experience is usually a matter of downloading the video or audio associated with a meeting, provided someone thought to record it (and I know who that someone was), then uploading that file to a service like Otter and waiting 10-15 minutes while it processes. Compared to just a few years ago this is very convenient, of course, but the number of meetings we take online has multiplied. Wherever I can shave a few minutes or clicks off my workflow I’m usually interested. Krisp has also shown a certain single-mindedness over the years, focusing on effective noise reduction across lots of devices and services. The advance that made it possible was basically training the system to recognize and isolate human voices, which while diverse are also distinct and very different from dogs barking, traffic noise and so on. For me, Krisp has generally Just Worked. So when they told me they were getting into transcription I was happy to hear it: It’s a natural extension of a voice-focused platform, and of course they know they can get a clean voice signal in. Krisp already operates more or less behind the scenes, acting as a passthrough for audio sources. So there’s no need for the “AI Meeting Assistant” to integrate with Google, Teams, Zoom or anything else, or be a phantom attendee — it deals strictly with your audio signal before it goes out or before theirs hits your ears. The transcription agent doesn’t need to talk to any services or APIs, it just identifies voices coming in and going out, and transcribes them, on your device. On-device transcription is a key differentiator, for one thing because it’s simpler than dealing with audio files, and for another because the audio of your meeting never leaves your computer. I’m not sure what threat models that’s important to, but I suspect they exist and will only get more prominent in the coming years.   The transcript itself is sent directly to Krisp’s cloud service, which for some kind of negates the security advantage of on-device transcription. But if you’re willing to trust another transcriber, why not this one? And anyhow, there will soon also be an option to keep your transcripts completely on device. Krisp CEO and co-founder Davit Baghdasaryan has a deep security background and said he’s looking forward to implementing this. (I suspect it’s just easier to build a web app than add major new capabilities to multiple mobile and desktop apps.) And how are the transcripts? In my experience, about as good as other AI-powered ones, which is to say better than my notes but not quite ready to publish. Ditching the audio right away negates one useful feature offered by other transcribers, quick checking and editing: click a suspicious word and it jumps to that spot in the audio. So for now at least, in interviews where you need to quote accurately and extensively, it may not be the best choice. But Krisp is positioning this as more of a productivity tool, building out a platform for quick extraction of key points from the innumerable meetings we sometimes find ourselves scheduling. To that end the company allows you to quickly send the transcript in for analysis by ChatGPT, which pulls out the TL;DR, assigned actions or whatever else needs to be pulled out of the meeting. Frankly, I’ve never liked these features and never use them, so I can’t speak to the quality here. They’re probably as good as any other service that does this, which is to say useful to the people who find such things of use. I try to forget about the contents of a meeting as quickly as possible, no doubt to the chagrin of my colleagues — but in my defense, I would just remember it wrong. Organized persons who have processes for this type of work may find the Krisp style works well for them, or not. I also am hesitant to judge a service that is essentially an API call to another service, which itself is constantly changing. As ChatGPT improves, so will the apps that rely on it — same here as in a hundred other platforms that suddenly evolved a capability to do natural language understanding. Krisp is free if you want to try it out — the company makes money on premium subscriptions for enterprise, and of course with the computation running on your device it’s quite simple to scale. It’s worth taking a moment on your Mac or PC to make sure that it’s properly configured, which is to say that its passthrough is working as intended. I had some weird issues early on but remedied them by starting from scratch and assigning only meeting apps and mics to go through Krisp, so it wouldn’t mix down my music. It’s just a handful of dials and switches, so take five minutes to do it right and soon your transcripts will be appearing so fast it’ll be kind of annoying."
260,Tesla brings back European referral program as end of Q1 nears,['@rebeccabellan'],"March 27, 2023","Tesla is bringing back its referral program to Europe, a strategy that taps into the brand loyalty of customers as it seeks to preserve market share and boost sales before the first quarter of 2023 closes. The referral program follows Tesla’s move to reduce prices in a variety of markets, including Europe, China and North America. Starting Tuesday in Europe, new Tesla buyers can receive 100 so-called “Loot Box Credits” when referred by a current Tesla owner, who will get 2,000 credits for the referral. If the referred customer takes delivery before March 31, 2023, they’ll get a bonus of 5,000 free Supercharging kilometers, and the referrer will get 10,000 credits. Those credits can be redeemed for software upgrades, up to 10,000 kilometers of free Supercharging “and more.” Explore your Loot Box in the Tesla app to view available credits, refer friends & shop for awards pic.twitter.com/pChM1CFCQV — Tesla Europe (@tesla_europe) March 27, 2023  Tesla has never used traditional advertising, so the company has historically used its referral program to get its loyal customer base to promote vehicles. Those rewards have changed over the last few years. At certain points, owners could win rewards like having a photo of their choosing launched into deep space orbit, an invite to an upcoming Tesla event, or even free new Roadsters if they had accumulated enough referrals. Tesla realized such extravagant rewards were starting to eat into profits, so the automaker paused the program in 2019 and came back with a more reasonable one that gives the referral giver and receiver 1,000 miles of free Supercharging each. Last November, Tesla launched a revamped referral program in the U.S. that gives out credits that can be put towards the purchase of Tesla solar products, like the Solar Roof and Solar Panels. Tesla also launched a program in China called Treasure Box, that lets owners get credits that can be used to buy accessories like vehicle chargers, t-shirts or shot glasses. The move in Europe suggests that Tesla is trying to hold on to, or even grow, its market share dominance. Tesla was the most popular EV brand in Europe last year, with the Model Y and Model 3 topping the ranks at 138,373 and 91,257 sales, respectively. Following behind were the Volkswagen ID.4 with 68,409 unit sales, the Fiat 500 electric with 66,732, and the Ford Kuga plug-in hybrid EV with 55,018 sales, according to Inside EVs. While Tesla was the most popular EV brand in Europe last year, it actually falls behind the large multi-brand OEMs. Volkswagen Group, which includes brands like Audi and VW, actually has the largest market share of plug-in EVs, with 20.6% of the pie. Stellantis, BMW Group and Hyundai follow with 14.6%, 10.5% and 10.1%, respectively. Mercedes and Tesla are tied with around 9% of the market. As of this week, Tesla finally hit production capacity of 5,000 vehicles per week at its Berlin gigafactory, a milestone that CEO Elon Musk had originally promised for the end of 2022. While production numbers don’t equal sales, it’s possible that the increased production in Europe could help the automaker maintain its position and gain even more market share in the future. The referral program isn’t the only move Tesla has made to boost sales, particularly before it reports quarterly earnings. In January, Tesla cut prices for Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the U.S. and Europe by 20%. Earlier this month, the automaker slashed Model S and Model X prices in the U.S. as well. In December 2022, Tesla also provided up to $7,500 discounts for vehicles purchased and delivered before the end of the year in the hopes of attracting buyers who might otherwise wait for the new year, when Inflation Reduction Act incentives would kick in."

262,Sega to acquire Angry Birds-maker Rovio for $775M,['@psawers'],"April 17, 2023","Japanese gaming giant Sega has confirmed that it’s buying Finland’s Rovio in an all-cash deal worth €706 million ($775 million). News first emerged back in January that Israeli mobile gaming company Playtika had tabled a €750 million ($810 million) bid for Rovio, though talks collapsed last month with no reasons provided by either company. Rovio did, however, confirm that it was still in talks with other parties, with rumors emerging over the weekend that Sonic the Hedgehog-maker Sega was in the mix. Now, the deal is official, with Rovio noting that it expects the deal to close in Q2 of its current fiscal year, meaning some time in the next couple of months — subject to “certain customary conditions.” Sega’s offer represents a 63.1% premium on Rovio’s closing price on January 19, the last trading date before reports first emerged of a potential acquisition, and a 19% premium on Rovio’s final closing price on Friday, April 14. Founded in 2003, Rovio emerged as one of the major success stories from the European technology sphere. While the company had produced dozens of games before the arrival of Android and iOS, it was the burgeoning smartphone revolution that catapulted Rovio into the mainstream consciousness, with Angry Birds becoming a global hit and franchise spanning everything from toys and cookbooks to movies and a TV show. Rovio went public in 2017, hitting the Nasdaq Helsinki to a somewhat lukewarm reception and a $1 billion valuation. In the intervening years, the company’s shares have been mostly in decline, generally sitting at around half of their IPO value. So it perhaps was little surprise that Rovio had started shopping itself around to potential suitors. With Rovio under its wing, Sega says it plans to “accelerate the development” of its own existing games, as well as “generate synergies” between Sega and Rovio’s brands. Specifically, it seems that Rovio’s experience in so-called “live service” mobile gaming is what appealed to Sega, which refers games designed to be played more or less indefinitely through regular content updates to keep players interested. Moreover, Sega said that Rovio’s expertise can help it expand Sega’s current and new games in more markets, particularly in Europe and North America. On the flip-side, Sega said that it will use its cross-platform expertise to enable Rovio to expand beyond mobile gaming, which presumably means to consoles and/or web browsers. So this deal effectively allows Sega to enhance its mobile gaming presence while simultaneously allowing Rovio to move in the other direction. “Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been SEGA’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” said Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega’s parent company Sega Sammy Holdings, in a press release. “I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”"
263,Rocket engine startup Ursa Major quietly closed $100M in new funding,['@breadfrom'],"April 25, 2023","Ursa Major has quietly closed $100 million in new funding, according to documents viewed by TechCrunch and multiple sources. Funders to the Series D include BlackRock and Space Capital. The funding was reportedly closed last October. The new capital came less than a year after the company closed an $85 million Series C. All told, the company has now raised around $234 million and sought the funding at a $400 million pre-money valuation. An Ursa Major spokesperson declined to comment “on rumors or speculation.” Ursa, led by CEO Joe Laurienti, is building a 5,000-pound liquid oxygen and kerosene engine called Hadley and a much larger, 10x more powerful Ripley engine with a 50,000-pound thrust. The company eschews the vertical integration paradigm that has historically dominated the aerospace industry. Instead, it focuses solely on the engine, one of the trickiest parts of a rocket to develop. “We really like the notion that we are a technology development company, and the companies that are flying rockets today should not be flying the same engine that they architected for their rocket 10 years ago,” Laurienti told TechCrunch in an interview last year. “That’s the paradigm we see in vertical integration.” Ursa’s public customer pool includes small launch companies Astra, Phantom Space and Stratolaunch. The company has also scored an engine delivery contract with the U.S. Air Force."
264,Apigee rolls out new AI-powered API protection features,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 24, 2023","Timed to coincide with the annual RSA cybersecurity conference, Google Cloud announced updates to Apigee, its API management and predictive analytics service, designed to help prevent business logic attacks. Business logic attacks are flaws in the design and implementation of an app that allow malicious actors to elicit unintended behavior. They can be tricky to identify — and very widespread. According to a study commissioned by Silver Tail Systems, 90% of companies lost revenue due to business logic attacks between 2011 and 2012. To combat these types of exploits, Google is introducing new machine learning models in Apigee that it says were trained to detect potential business logic attacks. Google Cloud claims that the models — available to all Apigee Advanced API Security customers, and trained on internal Google data — are sensitive enough to detect subtle behavior like an attacker with control of a server shifting the “activity patterns” of said server. “The machine learning models that power API abuse detection have been trained and used by Google’s internal teams to protect our public-facing APIs,” Shelly Hershkovitz, a product manager at Google Cloud, said in a blog post. “The models rely on years of learning and best practices.” Alongside the models, Apigee is introducing dashboards that ostensibly more accurately identify API abuses by finding patterns within the large number of alerts. The dashboards attempt to “capture the essence” of attacks, as Hershkovitz puts it, along with important characteristics like the source of the attacks, the number of API calls and the duration of the attacks. “With the growth of API traffic, enterprises across the world are also experiencing an uptick in malicious API attacks, making API security a heightened priority,” Hershkovitz continued. “We’re making it faster and easier to detect API abuse incidents.” Image Credits: Apigee Image Credits: Apigee To Hershkovitz’s point, it’s true that concerns over API security have grown — and are growing — in the enterprise. According to one survey (albeit one conducted by an API security vendor, full transparency), the end of 2022 saw a major spike in API attacks, with a 400% increase in volume from just a few months prior. These attacks can be pricey. An Imperva analysis of almost 117,000 security incidents found that API insecurity costs organizations between $41 billion and $75 billion annually. And a separate report from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project suggests that small firms face the highest number of API security events, with most incidents affecting companies with less than $50 million in revenue — making each breach even more damaging to the bottom line. Google’s own research — which must be taken with a grain of salt — shows that 50% of organizations have experienced an API security incident in the past 12 months; of those, 77% delayed the rollout of a new service or app. “It’s vital that organizations detect and mitigate API abuse incidents early to prevent prolonged fiscal and reputational damage to the business,” Hershkovitz said. “API security incidents are increasingly common and disruptive.”"
265,Why this round of tech optimism feels different,['@alex'],"March 26, 2023","One of my most joyous technology memories concerns Project Origami. The effort from Microsoft, Intel and others launched ultra-mobile PCs, or UMPCs. The devices, akin to squeezing a full Windows machine into something about the size of a midrange iPad, often complete with a physical keyboard, utterly fascinated me back around 2006. At that time I had roughly zero money, so buying one of the devices was entirely out of the question. But, while visiting an electronics store with my father after the first round of UMPCs came out — we were probably hunting up a piece of gear for his business — I walked down one aisle of computing hardware, and, to my astonishment, I found a promotional endcap of UMPC devices. I could use the devices that I had spent so much time nerding out over. It was a bit like meeting a celebrity to my teenaged self. I was bewitched. I’ve had other moments of pure tech bliss in my life: Back in high school when my friends and I realized that thanks to Gmail’s generous storage limits and my school’s reasonable internet, we could ditch USB sticks entirely and just email files to one another from across the same table. It felt like magic, to use bits instead of anything that we had to carry in our pocket. Technology has a simply beautiful way of taking your breath away at times, showing you that there is a new shortcut or new way of thinking that is now before you that was previously entirely occluded. This is how the iPhone launch felt, to highlight a well-known example of the phenomenon. Not much since then has given me the same jolt. Perhaps when I fell in love with Twitter, realizing in an instant that I just tweet as much as I wanted, and no one could stop me; the first moment I had my own blog on the internet and I was freed from any sort of publishing constraint."
266,"With $20M in new funding, Hydrosat preps climate-monitoring satellites for launch",['@stefaniewaldek'],"April 25, 2023","Data is becoming as precious as water in precision agriculture, and Hydrosat aims to help provide both with a new set of Earth observation satellites. The company has raised a $20 million A round, including $5 million in non-dilutive funding, which should put the first two thermal infrared satellites into orbit. The company’s mission is to provide customers from agribusinesses to the government real-time thermal infrared data, which can be used for solutions from drought prediction to ecosystem monitoring to disease vector mapping. “The ability to track water stress and climate impacts in real time is a critical pain point for Hydrosat’s agribusiness, financial and government customers,” Hydrosat CEO Pieter Fossel tells TechCrunch. “This need is only being felt more acutely with the increasing pace of extreme weather events brought on by climate change and increasing instability in global food supply chains from geopolitics and the war in Ukraine.” Currently, Hydrosat develops crop yield forecasts and irrigation management solutions based on open Earth observation datasets. But those datasets are relatively infrequently updated and usually somewhat low resolution. So Hydrosat’s next step is developing its own 16-satellite constellation that will provide constant high-resolution thermal images from space to improve the solutions for customers. Led by Statkraft Ventures, with additional participants including Blue Bear Capital and Hartree Partners, this funding will “accelerate the commercial go-to-market of Hydrosat’s two core analytics solutions,” says Fossel, nodding to the crop yield forecasts and irrigation management tools. But it will also go toward the launches of VanZyl-1 and VanZyl-2, the company’s first fully operational commercial satellite missions. Both missions are due to launch next year, with VanZyl-1 securing a flight with Loft Orbital. The funding builds the company’s $15 million seed from 2021. “Hydrosat flew a prototype thermal infrared mission in January 2021 on a stratospheric balloon at 20-kilometer altitude with support from the U.S. Air Force Space Test Program. That prototype mission flew and imaged successfully at altitude,” says Fossel. “The stratospheric mission served as a major risk reduction milestone for Hydrosat’s first two on-orbit missions and paved the way for subsequent funding and development.” Once operational in orbit, the satellites will provide “analytics-ready, science-quality data of the entire Earth,” according to Fossel. And that data will provide even richer insights for Hydrosat’s growing client base."
267,Uber sells $400M stake in Careem super app business,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 10, 2023","Careem, the Middle East-based ride-hailing company that Uber bought in 2019, is spinning out its super app business into a new startup backed with $400 million from Emirates Telecommunications Group Company. Emirates Telecommunications, the UAE telco giant that is now known as e&, said Monday it reached an agreement with Uber to buy a 50.03% stake in the new company called Careem Technologies. Following the deal, Careem will be broken into two companies, Careem Rides and Careem Technologies, according to a blog post from Careem CEO and co-founder Mudassir Sheikha. The clear aim is to make its Super App unit the dominate business. Careem Rides, which will be fully owned by Uber, will be staffed by 260 people and focus on its core ride-hailing product. Ashish Labroo, who will start reporting into Uber’s Rides leadership, will lead Careem Rides. Careem Technologies will operate the “Super App” along with all other verticals, according to Sheikha. This business will be owned jointly by e&, Uber and Careem’s co-founders, which includes Sheikha and Magnus Olsson. This unit, which will be led by Sheikha, will have about 1,400 employees. Careem was founded in 2012 as a ride-hailing rival to Uber and has since added food and package delivery, bus services and credit transfers. Careem made a number of acquisitions, such as RoundMenu and Commut, as it diversified its business. Uber acquired Careem in 2019 for $3.1 billion. This latest move shows Careem’s founders and its newest investor see the most potential in services that stretch well beyond ride-hailing. The Super app, which is available in 10 countries, combines all of Careem’s products such as food delivery, bike rentals and financial services that let users send and receive payments, and third-party services like cleaning into a single platform. Sheikha said the $400 million in new funding will be used to “scale the Super App and build category-leading verticals in all our key markets.”"
268,Jack Dorsey-backed Twitter alternative Bluesky hits Android,['@sarahintampa'],"April 20, 2023","Looking to leave the Twitter ecosystem? Bluesky, the Twitter alternative backed by Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, has now rolled out to Android users. The app, which promises a future of decentralized social networking and choose-your-own algorithms, initially launched to iOS users in late February and remains in a closed beta. The exclusivity is driving demand for the newer social network to some extent, but so is having Dorsey’s name attached. For many, Bluesky represents the hope of a Twitter do-over — where the core concepts around short-form posts and a shared timeline remain, but the problems around moderation and centralized control are addressed. Bluesky aims to give users algorithmic choice, letting them eventually choose from a marketplace of algorithms that let them control what they see on their own feed, instead of having it controlled by some central authority. At launch, however, Bluesky remains a pared-down version of Twitter without many of the features that make the social network what it is today, including basic tools for tracking likes or bookmarks, editing tweets, quote-tweeting, DM’s, using hashtags and more. It’s also building in decentralization with its own protocol — the AT Protocol — instead of contributing to the existing work around ActivityPub, the protocol powering the open source Twitter alternative Mastodon and a range of other decentralized apps in the wider “Fediverse” — the name for these interconnected servers running open software used for web publishing. Image Credits: Bluesky Image Credits: Bluesky That puts Bluesky on the outside of where a lot of the current activity is taking place around decentralized social networking. Though Mastodon has been criticized for being overly complicated or having bad vibes, at times, the protocol behind it has inspired a wave of new development following Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter takeover. Former Twitter app makers turned their attention to the social network after Musk unceremoniously cut off their access to Twitter’s API, having newly launched polished Mastodon clients like Ivory and Mammoth. Flipboard and Medium have also taken active roles in the community, setting up their own Mastodon servers, and Tumblr has been weighing its options. Despite its challenges, demand for Bluesky seems to have been picking up. Anecdotally, it felt as if there was increased demand for Bluesky access over the past couple of weeks, thanks in part to Bluesky’s waitlist system and the limited number of invites available. The network recently let in more users and now claims to have a small user base of around 20,000. Demand for Bluesky may be even higher, however. According to app intelligence firm data.ai, Bluesky has seen 240,000 lifetime installs on iOS, 135,000 of which were just this month, up 39% from March’s 97,000. With the app’s arrival on Android, it’s clear Bluesky wants to grow that number further. What’s not clear is how Bluesky’s future development will be funded. Last year, Bluesky received $13 million as it spun out from Twitter, ensuring it had the freedom and independence to get started on R&D. Jack Dorsey continues to sit on its board but also devotes his time to other projects, like Nostr, in addition to running Block. And it’s not likely that Musk’s Twitter will continue to fund its competitor — in fact, it’s crazy that Twitter’s own board ever allowed this in the first place!   That could put Bluesky in a position where it will, at some point, need to raise further capital, putting it in competition with other Twitter alternatives looking for financial backing from investors. In addition to Mastodon, T2, Spill, Post and others are now trodding down this same path, hoping to lure disgruntled users to their own app ecosystems. But that means the Twitter diaspora may not find a “new Twitter” in the end, but dozens of smaller communities offering a Twitter-like experience instead."
269,"YouTube updates its policies on eating disorder content, will ban videos showing ‘imitable behavior’",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 18, 2023","YouTube is updating its guidelines for dealing with eating disorder content on its platform, the Google-owned company announced on Tuesday. Although the platform has long removed content that glorifies or promotes eating disorders, YouTube will now also prohibit content about eating disorders that users could be prompted to imitate. Such behaviors could include purging after eating or severely restricting calories. YouTube will also prohibit content that could lead at-risk users to imitate certain behavior, such as weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders. YouTube also announced that videos that are centered on eating disorder recovery or include sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context (EDSA) may receive an age restriction and/or a crisis resource panel. Content that contains EDSA or discusses disordered eating behaviors in the context of recovery may still not be suitable for all ages, YouTube says, which is why it’s introducing age restrictions on certain content about eating disorders. As a result of the updated policy, some videos will not be available to viewers under 18, if you’re signed out or if the video is embedded on another website. For instance, YouTube may age-restrict videos where a creator is talking about the disordered eating behaviors they have engaged in while sharing their recovery journey. “We developed this age restriction approach for eating disorder-related videos in consultation with third-party experts to strike the right balance in our continuing efforts to protect younger viewers from content they may be more susceptible to imitating than adults,” the company wrote in a blog post. “As with all our Community Guidelines updates, these age restrictions will take some time to fully ramp up, so you may not see them right away.” YouTube currently places crisis resource panels at the top of search results related to eating disorders in U.S., U.K., India, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, France and Germany. Now, the company is expanding crisis resource panels to also appear on Watch pages in these countries. YouTube believes this change will allow it to reach an even broader audience with important context and mental health resources. The platform plans to launch these panels in even more countries in the future. Image Credits: YouTube Image Credits: YouTube The policy updates, developed in consultation with the National Eating Disorder Association and other nonprofit organizations, aim to ensure that YouTube creates “space for community, recovery and resources, while continuing to protect viewers.” The updated policy comes as social media platforms are facing increasing scrutiny for negatively impacting young users. In 2021, lawmakers questioned executives from YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat about how their platforms deal with eating disorder content. Although the companies testified that they each have policies prohibiting content that promotes eating disorders, senators cited evidence from constituents about teenagers on these platforms who have still suffered from illnesses like anorexia and bulimia. During the hearing, YouTube executives pointed out how some users can find solace in a video about how someone overcame an eating disorder, and that this content can be uplifting and help teens know that they’re not alone in what they’re experiencing. The company is now addressing concerns that although this type of content aims to be helpful, it can sometimes negatively impact users, hence the new age restrictions on certain content about eating disorders when it comes to recovery. The features announced today will be visible starting today and ramping up in the coming weeks. YouTube says these efforts are ongoing and that it will continue working toward ensuring its platform is a safe place for users.  "
270,Throne fixes security bug that exposed creators’ private home addresses,['@zackwhittaker'],"April 6, 2023","A recently fixed security bug at a popular platform for supporting creators shows how even privacy-focused platforms can put creators’ private information at risk. Throne, founded in 2021, bills itself as “a fully secure, concierge wishlist service that acts as an intermediary between your fans and you.” Throne claims to support more than 200,000 creators by shipping out thousands of their wish list items per day, all the while protecting the privacy of the creators’ home address. The idea is that online creators, like streamers and gamers, can publish a wish list of gifts that supporters can buy, and Throne acts as the go-between. “Your fans pay for the gifts and we handle the rest,” its website reads. “We make sure that the payment gets processed, that the item gets sent, and most importantly, that your private information stays private.” But a group of good-faith hackers found a vulnerability that undermined that claim and exposed the private home addresses of its creator users. Enter Zerforschung, the German collective of security researchers behind its latest discovery. You may remember the collective from December when they found and disclosed major security bugs in social media alternative Hive, which sprung to popularity in the exodus from Twitter under Elon Musk’s new ownership. Hive briefly shut itself down to fix the vulnerabilities found by Zerforschung, which allowed anyone to modify anyone else’s posts and access other people’s private messages. Zerforschung told TechCrunch that they discovered the vulnerability in how the company set up its database, hosted on Google’s Firebase, to store data. The researchers said that the database was inadvertently configured to allow anyone on the internet to access the data inside, including session cookies for its Amazon accounts from the database, which can be used to break into an account without needing the password. Session cookies are small bits of code that sit on your computer or device to keep users logged into apps and websites without having to repeatedly re-enter a password or sign-in with two-factor authentication. Because session cookies keep the user logged in, they can be an attractive target for hackers since they can be used to log in as if they were that user. That can also make it more difficult to detect when someone other than the user is misusing a session cookie. With those Amazon session cookies, the security researchers found they could access Throne’s Amazon account used for ordering and sending gifts from a creator’s wish list, without ever needing a password. The researchers said that anyone with the same session cookies, effectively the keys to Throne’s Amazon account, could log in and look back at thousands of orders and their creators’ names and addresses. Zerforschung demonstrated the bug in a video call with TechCrunch last week, allowing us to verify their findings. The researchers showed us the thousands of orders placed through Throne’s Amazon account in the past few months, showing that the names and addresses of creators that Throne claimed to protect were exposed. The collective of researchers reported the bug to Throne later the same day. Throne fixed the bug shortly after, and confirmed the security lapse in a blog post published this week, thanking Zerforschung for their findings. “In late March a version of Throne was shipped which had misconfigured Firestore rules. This made it possible for the security researchers to read some data which should not have been available such as the blocked IP addresses we maintain for fraud prevention purposes and session cookies for a small subset of our merchant accounts,” Throne said. Zerforschung published details of the bug in a blog post once it was fixed. But questions remain for the company. Throne says it used network logs to determine that “there was no risk and no unknown party had viewed any data.” Zerforschung disputes this claim, as Throne did not ask the collective for their IP addresses that the company could use to investigate the incident while ruling out the researchers’ activity. Logs are important because they keep track of internal events, such as who logs in from where, and when. The logic goes that if security researchers like Zerforschung found the bug, it could be that malicious actors may have discovered it as well. It’s not clear if anyone else accessed or exfiltrated Throne data, or if Throne has the technical ability to determine what, if any, data was viewed. Throne also claimed in its blog post that an unnamed German data privacy expert “confirmed that there was no data risk,” which doesn’t make sense since Zerforschung proved that to the contrary. When reached for comment, Throne co-founder Patrice Becker reiterated much of Throne’s blog post in boilerplate remarks but declined to answer our specific questions or provide the name of the alleged data privacy expert from its blog post. Becker did not dispute Zerforschung’s findings or the exposure of creators’ home addresses when asked about this. Updated on April 7 with a link to Zerforschung’s published blog post."
271,Epic Games produces documents in antitrust case showing Googlers avoiding its litigation hold [Update: judge agrees],['@sarahintampa'],"March 27, 2023","In a new filing in Epic Games’ antitrust case against Google, lawyers for the plaintiffs have submitted a number of exhibits that attempt to demonstrate Google employees’ tendency to switch off chat history on internal discussions. Epic believes this behavior is meant to destroy sensitive communications related to its lawsuit, but it’s not the only one making this claim. The issue with Google’s deletion of chat history was also recently cited by the U.S. Department of Justice in its own antitrust investigation, where it alleged Google had for years “routinely destroyed” an entire category of communication. That makes the new discovery of communications where Google employees often instructed others to turn off chat all the more interesting. [Update, 3/28/23: a federal judge has now ruled that Google’s failure to preserve messages requires sanctions. The judge is requiring Google to pay attorney fees and is debating what other non-monetary sanctions will be needed.]  Original story continues below  In one particularly notable instance, Google CEO Sundar Pichai asked for the chat history to be turned off and then tried to unsuccessfully delete the preceding message. It’s not clear, however, from the exhibit shared with the court, that the topic of the conversation would have had bearing on Epic’s antitrust case against the tech giant. However, in other chats, Google employees were found to be asking others to switch off chat history when discussing more potentially relevant matters, like Revenue Share Agreement (RSA) contracts, Mobile App Distribution Agreements and a topic called “Project Runway,” which was the internal codename for a project that involved changing the Google Play commission rate in response to developer complaints and the threat of regulation. In another example, Google’s Head of Platforms & Ecosystems Strategy for Android, Margaret Lam, remarks “I talk about RSA related things all day and I don’t have have history on for all my chats :),” after another employee had informed her that any conversation about RSA needed to have chat history turned on “per policy.” “We cannot delete it. I am also on multiple legal hold,” the employee advised her, to which she responded, “Ok maybe I take you off this convo,” followed by a laughing face emoji. When pressed as to why she was going against the company training on the matter, Lam said “it’s just causing more touchpoints on my end,” then added she would ping others directly — seemingly a choice meant to route around the chats with history, rather than allowing the conversation to be documented. In other conversations, Lam is spotted again asking employees to turn off history, the exhibits show. In a separate 2021 conversation, one Google employee asks another if they can discuss Project Runway and was reminded to “communicate with care” because everything said would be subject to discovery if there were any regulatory or legal proceedings in the future.” They were also reminded that group chats can’t have history turned off, “unlike 1:1 chat threads where you can turn off history and they disappear in 24 hours.” Another couple of conversations features Google VP Tian Lim (who has since changed jobs to join Roblox) asking to turn chat history off. But the same employee had testified on January 12, 2023, that he had made “a good-faith effort to comply with obligations to preserve chat communications that were subject to the legal hold.” Of course, it’s again not clear from the filings that Lim’s subsequent conversations would have been relevant to Epic’s case, but the point of these exhibits is to raise the question as to why switching off chat was such a common practice. Epic originally filed suit against Google over the alleged antitrust violations in August 2020, shortly after it forced Google to remove its Fortnite mobile game from the Play Store by intentionally violating Google Play policies around in-app purchases. (The company had done the same thing with Apple, but both parties were unhappy with the outcome of that case, which is now in the hands of an appeals court.) As most of the chats submitted in this new discovery are from the following year, it would have been clear to Google employees by then that a litigation hold on their conversations was necessary. That said, across the 35 new exhibits featuring various Google employees discussing when or if to turn off chat history, or asking others to do so, it’s not clear that they were actively planning to discuss Epic Games or its antitrust claims, specifically. Instead, it appears the Google employees were having business-related conversations that may or not have ultimately been relevant to the case — something it will be hard at this point to determine, as many chats had been moved to off-the-record locations. What the records attempt to show is that many at Google had a habit of switching off chat history or shifting conversations to places where they couldn’t be tracked. However, it will be up to a judge to determine whether or not Google should be sanctioned for this behavior. But the judge’s determination could then be referenced in the DoJ case against Google, which is making similar claims about Google’s alleged destruction of evidence.   Google responded with the following comment: “Our teams have conscientiously worked, for years, to respond to Epic and the state AGs’ discovery requests and we have produced over three million documents, including thousands of chats. We’ll continue to show the court how choice, security, and openness are built into Android and Google Play.”   updated, 3/28/23 9:40 am et with Google comment"
272,Coro raises $75M at a $575M valuation to grow its all-in-one cybersecurity platform,['@ingridlunden'],"April 19, 2023","Simplification has been a big theme in the enterprise world in the last couple of years. If a company can consolidate multiple point solutions into one product or contract, it can reduce complexity and ultimately costs for the end user — so long as those all-in-one offerings are effective at doing the job that 5, 10 or 30 separate pieces of software were doing before. Today, a startup called Coro — which provides a one-stop shop AI-based cybersecurity platform — is announcing $75 million in funding, a sign of the traction it’s been getting to date with its target customers, mid-market companies. (“Mid-market” is anything between 500 and 4,000 employees, in the eyes of Guy Moskowitz, Coro’s CEO and co-founder.) The funding is coming from a single investor, Energy Impact Partners, known for green-tech investments as well as backing a number of cybersecurity and enterprise startups. This is effectively a “Series C2,” coming almost exactly a year after Coro — founded in Israel but with offices also in the U.S. and the U.K. — announced a $60 million Series C from Balderton and JVP, with a valuation that directly tacks the new funding onto the old valuation: Coro’s valuation was $500 million, and post-money it is now $575 million. Coro’s aim is to provide a cloud-based, SaaS offering to cover all of a business’s cybersecurity software needs, with the main themes being device monitoring; tools for overseeing activity across users, email, networks, data and apps; and remediating any malicious activity when it’s identified. Coro’s target customer, the mid-market business, often falls into a grey area when it comes to software: too big to use SMB products usefully and safely, yet too small to have the infrastructure and budgets to use products built for larger enterprises. But because companies of this size are still a lucrative target — and one that’s often under-secured, as it happens — they often find themselves in the crosshairs of malicious hackers. One report found mid-market companies to be 350% more likely to face a cyberattack than larger businesses, and as a signal of the opportunity here (and the problem), in general mid-market companies are becoming more aware of the issues. That also means competition to serve their needs. Others in the same space (providing varying levels of different security products) include Secureframe, Forcepoint, Red Canary and others. Coro does not disclose whether it is profitable, but co-founder Dror Liwer said in an interview that it grew its annual recurring revenues 300% each year for the last four (the company is actually older than that: it started in 2015 as a consumer-focused device security business called Coronet but pivoted to enterprise around 2019). Notably — in a year of belt tightening amid wider economic slowdowns and inflation — it’s on track to do the same in 2022. It currently has around 5,000 customers. Inflation may not have slowed Coro’s growth, but it has had another impact: Coro recently put up its prices to $8.99/user/month, but it claims its overall tariffs are still far lower than the prices companies would pay if they were buying, integrating and managing a number of security apps to address the same range of use cases and scenarios that Coro does. Typically, a customer of the size that Coro targets might have between 15 and 25 security products, paying in total between $25 to $45/user/month. “It becomes a no-brainer,” said Liwer. The funding will be used across a few areas. The first of these will be investing in more R&D. Tamping down some of the hype of the moment, the company has been using AI “since day one,” Liwer said. “For us, it’s not a buzzy thing at all.” Its use of AI has been in the form of unsupervised machine learning that is constantly tracking traffic for its customers, detecting anomalies and increasingly learning more about malicious practices as time passes, knowledge that is then applied across the whole of its platform to all of its customers and helps Coro not just fend off known bad actors and actions but also discover new approaches. There are no uses of generative AI at Coro itself, he said, and — for security reasons — he declined to comment on what it might be working on in this space, or what the biggest new threats might be — but he did note that AI has had another major impact for Coro and its customers: a huge spike in malicious hacking attempts, with most of that new volume getting generated by AI — generative AI, specifically. “We are seeing threat actors using AI to better hone their abilities, whether it’s to crack credentials or write better phishing emails. The whole gamut,” he said. They were already doing all that, he added, “but we’re seeing an uptick in the amount.” The other area of focus will be to act on a little M&A, taking advantage of the fact that there are a lot of talented engineers and promising technology being built in the cybersecurity space, but a lack of funding at the moment for point solutions: all of that translates into opportunities for opening conversations with smaller startups that might have not been as easy to do in the past. The third will be to continue hiring — Coro is one of the coveted group of startups that has added staff rather than laid people off in the last year — and business development. “Coro’s phenomenal growth shows they have the right solution for a huge and underserved market,” said Shawn Cherian, a partner at Energy Impact Partners, in a statement. “Mid-market companies need a comprehensive cyber solution that protects their vital business assets without spending outrageous sums or requiring hard to find cybersecurity experts. Coro’s AI-powered platform, based on a modern approach to solving cybersecurity challenges, is taking the market by storm. We’re thrilled to be a part of the Coro revolution as they help secure the nation’s mid-market businesses and enable them to grow and thrive.”"
273,Threading the needle: Exploring 5 ideas with the founders of LGBT+ VC,['@dominicmadori'],"March 24, 2023","Silicon Valley’s full of people from all walks of life, but very little of its wealth is distributed evenly, especially when we’re talking about the LGBTQ+ community. Currently, it’s estimated that less than 1% of venture capital goes to openly LGBTQ+ founders. There are no numbers on how much of that capital goes specifically to trans founders or how many investors identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. What is known is that LGBTQ+ founders still feel the need to hide their identity from investors. Enter LGBT+ VC, a nonprofit organization that aims to advance LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+-allied venture investors. Launched by investors Tiana Tukes, a Black trans woman who has worked at Accenture, Sequoia Capital and Silicon Valley Bank, and Jackson Block, a former early-stage investor who identifies as bisexual, the nonprofit hopes to foster a new generation of inclusivity within the venture ecosystem by cultivating and educating investors to champion and accept LGBTQ+ founders and funders. To that end, LGBT+ VC plans to run networking events, conferences and education classes for the LGBTQ+ community to help them learn how to become accredited investors, one of many steps needed to change the mindset and add more intersectionality within venture theses. “We are trying to change who is an investor and who these founders can have opportunities with,” Block told TechCrunch+. “The best investors right now are investing in LGBTQ-founded companies,” Tukes added. “Open AI is a prime example. That, to me, is the hot-ticket company at the moment.” The initiative comes amidst a historic wave of hate being directed at the LGBTQ+ community in the U.S., with anti-trans legislation sweeping the country and crimes against the LGBTQ+ community increasing nationwide. In fact, Tukes and Block were inspired to launch the nonprofit after the Colorado Springs nightclub shooting late last year, which saw a gunman target the only LGBTQ+ club in the city and murder five people. “It was really difficult to see the silence of the venture community,” Block told TechCrunch+. “Tiana and I came together, and we thought, ‘where can we make a difference?’” That resulted in the duo tapping into their networks and assessing the relationship the LGBTQ+ community currently has with the tech ecosystem. So far, Tukes says the reception has been warm and the nonprofit has managed to attract investors from a few law and accounting firms as well as banks and larger tech companies. On June 19 and June 20, the nonprofit will host its first summit in New York City, dubbed Stonewall to Silicon Valley. This is all part of a larger mission to change what it means to be a venture capitalist. I recently sat down with the two investors to talk about their nonprofit, how they started it and their plans to build a network of allies. (Editor’s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity) Why did you decide to launch this nonprofit together, and how did you know now was the time to take the risk? Jackson Block: There’s a huge opportunity hiding in plain sight. Twenty percent of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ+. Moreover, according to Gallup, the LGBTQ+ community is one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. population. That’s a market opportunity. Tiana Tukes: Our mission is to help all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and queer people prosper. In U.S. history, in particular, there are moments, particularly in the civil rights movement, where Black leaders and Jewish leaders [Block is Jewish] came together in times of crisis for social advancement. We see this as a continuation of that legacy first and, secondly, as part of our LGBTQ+ history. You said the biggest problem LGBTQ+ investors face right now is a supply issue. What do you mean by that and how do you hope to alleviate that? JB: From OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to Apple CEO Tim Cook, LGBTQ+ founders and tech leaders are leading the way when it comes to innovation. We want more decision-makers like GV’s Laela Sturdy and Cake Ventures’ Monique Woodard, who understand the value and challenges of our community. But we haven’t reached parity yet. To succeed in the long run, LGBTQ+ founders deserve more champions. A wider range of investors is needed, from full-time venture capitalists to angels. TT: It can be lonely being the only one, and one of the best ways to combat that is by connecting with a community like ours. We want everyone to prosper, and it matters now because wealth compounds across generations. Partly due to discrimination, queer people don’t always grow up with traditional families, so we choose our own. Here lies our opportunity to create new strategies for cultivating and sharing resources together. Relationships within the LGBTQ+ community can be fraught, especially when race and gender are considered. How do you seek to build a network of allies within the community? JB: Starting from day one, we believed in coalition and leading by example. You heard a bit earlier about my and Tiana’s relationship as a continuation of the past as well as an opportunity for the future between Black and Jewish relations: myself, bisexual; Tiana, trans. We really believe in the power of bringing people together. TT: I agree. I know firsthand how difficult it can be to build coalitions across differences, but it is possible. We will prioritize our time, attention and energy by doubling down on people and parties who already understand our mission and the value that we add to the ecosystem. It is a moot point or superfluous for us to turn our attention to those who are against us from the beginning or show immediate friction to our mission. We’ve been really fortunate from day one to have partners who are just so earnest about their interest in working with us. I know that a common narrative is that it’s divisive and that there are those who don’t want to work together. But frankly, that’s not been my experience, particularly because I tend to turn up the volume on those [who are] already at the table and working with us. How would you like to see LPs, government legislation and emerging funds working together to create a more economically fair system within venture capital? JB: We’ve already spoken with the SEC small business advocacy team about education efforts for LGBTQ+ funders and founders, as well as other government officials here in New York City and their economic development corporation. The thing that we talk about most is really a supply of funders and having incentives for them. That’s really important, as well as things like the Equality Act. There’s no legislation protecting LGBTQ+ funders and founders from discrimination in private and public markets. The Equality Act, which marks its 50th anniversary next year, will ensure that LGBTQ+ people are treated the same as all other Americans. It’s one example of an educational topic to discuss within the innovation economy. TT: Our mission, from day one, included increasing the number of accredited investors and to be the LPs, angels and VCs who can make those investments. That’s where our attention lies. When people look back at this nonprofit in 10 years what do you hope its legacy will be? TT: We are focused on today. And from today, we’ll make a better tomorrow. This article was updated to clarify the nonprofit’s mission.      "
274,Kodiak Robotics will haul freight autonomously for Tyson Foods,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 20, 2023","Autonomous trucking startup Kodiak Robotics is partnering with truckload carrier C.R. England to autonomously ship Tyson Foods products between Dallas and San Antonio, Texas. A human safety operator will be present in the one dedicated truck Kodiak is allocating to this pilot. Deliveries will begin this month, according to the company. The pilot program is the latest in Kodiak’s growing string of paid partnerships with major carriers, and it further demonstrates the startup’s potential path to sustainability and even profitability once it removes the human safety driver from operations. A spokesperson for Kodiak said the company aims to remove the safety operator within the next couple of years. The pilot with Tyson will see Kodiak hauling three to five loads per week. C.R. England will have one of its human drivers bring a refrigerated trailer pre-loaded with Tyson protein products to Kodiak’s facility in Lancaster, just outside of Dallas. Then one of Kodiak’s autonomous trucks will deliver the load to a C.R. England drop yard in San Antonio. From there, a C.R. England truck and driver will deliver the trailer to its final destination in Laredo. Kodiak says the partnership is not only emblematic of how human-driven trucks and autonomous trucks can work together, but it also provides a use case for autonomy as a solution for moving perishable products in a timely manner. “One of the categories where C.R. England is a leader is in perishable foods, which require the safest, most reliable, on-time delivery possible,” said Chad England, CEO of C.R. England, in a statement. “Kodiak’s proven performance and commitment to customer success makes it a great partner to help us introduce autonomous service into our operations.” As part of the partnership, C.R. England is also joining Kodiak’s Partner Development Program, which is Kodiak’s way of working with carriers to help establish autonomous freight operations and, hopefully, integrate Kodiak’s self-driving system into their fleet. “Our intent is to be a ‘one-stop shop’ for customers, whether they need their freight moved autonomously or not,” said England. Other companies that are part of this development program include 10 Roads Express, Werner Enterprises and U.S. Xpress. Each of those partnerships involved a short freight pilot that offered learnings into what autonomous trucking operations could look like if adopted at scale. “For example, with some of them, we are currently deciding on the next lane that we’ll haul freight with them,” Michael Wiesinger, VP of commercialization at Kodiak, told TechCrunch. “Some of them say they want to have longer lanes. We recently announced Dallas to Atlanta and we will do more with that, so now it’s just about us figuring out together when is the right time to start those freight operations again. And how does it work from our capacity perspective, because we also have limited capacity.” All up, Kodiak has about 30 trucks in its fleet doing more than 50 loads per week, all of which are paid commercial deliveries. Kodiak has maintained ongoing freight pilots with Ceva Logistics, Ikea and Forward Air, as well as a few other companies that the startup hasn’t yet announced publicly, according to Wiesinger.  "
275,"This Week in Apps: TikTok goes to Congress, apps connect to ChatGPT, Microsoft’s mobile games store plan",['@sarahintampa'],"March 25, 2023","Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app economy in 2023 hit a few snags, as consumer spending last year dropped for the first time by 2% to $167 billion, according to data.ai’s “State of Mobile” report. However, downloads are continuing to grow, up 11% year-over-year in 2022 to reach 255 billion. Consumers are also spending more time in mobile apps than ever before. On Android devices alone, hours spent in 2022 grew 9%, reaching 4.1 trillion. This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more. Do you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here: techcrunch.com/newsletters Image Credits: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Image Credits: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Thursday’s testimony by TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew before the U.S. House Committee on Energy & Commerce was largely unproductive. Representatives were often more interested in sharing their own opinions, posturing and shouting over the CEO’s answers to their questions, rather than attempting to learn any real intel about how TikTok works or what it does to protect its youngest users from harm. Overall, it seemed the hearing was more for show than any sort of fact-finding mission — these reps already had their minds made up, for the most part, about whether or not the app should be banned. During the hearing, however, a few legitimate questions were raised that had troubling responses. On the matter of Project Texas — TikTok’s plan to move all U.S. user data off of its own servers over to Oracle servers in the U.S. — it wasn’t clear how that would fully separate TikTok from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. As one line of questioning pointed out, TikTok employees use an internal software program known as Lark — a sort of Chinese Slack — to communicate with their ByteDance colleagues. TikTok’s CEO reports to ByteDance’s CEO, Liang Rubo. Chew also admitted that even under Project Texas there were exceptions that would allow data to leave the country for “interoperability purposes” and he would have to “get back to your team” on the specifics there. And when directly questioned about what sort of other software or IT services would still connect TikTok to ByteDance under Project Texas, Chew again said he would have to “get back to you” with his answers. Image Credits: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Image Credits: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images In addition, the exec couldn’t confirm where TikTok sells its data. Chew said he didn’t “believe” they sold to data brokers, but said he would have to “get back” to Congress on who they may actually sell to. While Chew may be correct that today’s TikTok isn’t doing more data collection than U.S. social giants, it’s being held to different standards. As a Chinese company with its hands on this data, there’s the potential for the CCP to meddle in TikTok’s operations, the politicians believe. Though that may not have happened yet, there is a threat posed by China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law, which compels businesses to assist in intelligence-gathering operations, if asked. TikTok claims it wouldn’t comply, but how could it not, if ByteDance is its parent? The House reps also asked a range of questions about minor safety. Ironically, it was TikTok that led the way in this area by being the first of the big social apps in the U.S. to roll out in-app parental controls and lock down teen accounts. Still, dangerous challenges have proliferated on its platform (though Meta was later revealed to have had a hand in which ones made the news!). And like other algorithmic-based platforms, there’s always a danger that its recommendations could surface harmful content at times. However, some of the dangers of social media aren’t unique to TikTok alone. Social media usage overall is contributing to increased anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating and other troubles, including suicide ideation, which is why it needs regulation or at least some basic guidelines. But today’s politicians don’t seem to be able to do the hard work of actually getting laws passed in this area, despite their bipartisan interest in doing so. They’d rather put on a show in Congress to make themselves look good to their potential voters so they can win their next election. OpenAI this week launched plugins for ChatGPT, which allow the bot to access third-party databases and other sources of knowledge, including those on the web. The company said it would start with a small set of users before rolling out access to the still now alpha stage product more broadly. OpenAI is also hosting its own plugins, including a web browser and code interpreter and is now extending plugin access to developers on its waitlist.   A number of companies consumers know and love have already built plugins for ChatGPT, including Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram and Zapier. For example, OpenTable’s plugin can search across restaurants for available bookings, while the Instacart plugin can place orders from local stores. To get started, users pick a plugin to enable when they start a conversation on chat.openai.com. In a demo on OpenAI’s website, it shows a user asking in plain language for “one great restaurant suggestion on Saturday” and ” a simple recipe for Sunday” involving vegan food. The OpenTable plugin finds a local restaurant with a reservation, then follows detailed requests for returning the recipe info and ordering ingredients on Instacart. (If only this technology was available in Siri!) It’s easy to imagine a future where you could one day interact with these services through AI commands, not by tapping around on apps’ screens. And being able to talk naturally to the AI could make services easier to use for everyone, not just the technically inclined. Microsoft is betting that incoming tech regulations will allow it a way to compete in the mobile gaming market alongside Apple and Google (and likely Epic Games, if things go its way). In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Microsoft gaming head Phil Spencer noted that the EU’s Digital Market Act (DMA) is expected to go into effect next March, which would allow companies to load their own app stores on Apple and Android devices. And Microsoft wants to do just that. “We want to be in a position to offer Xbox and content from both us and our third-party partners across any screen where somebody would want to play,” Spencer told the FT. Microsoft had already hinted at its plans to launch an Xbox-branded mobile game store that would leverage content from Activision Blizzard — assuming that deal gains regulatory approval. The game maker’s IP could help Microsoft seed a new game store thanks to its titles like Call of Duty Mobile and those from the Candy Crush franchise. Microsoft has also acquired a number of gaming studios over the past several years, including Ninja Theory, Playground Games and Bethesda owner Zenimax Media. If things progress as planned, the mobile apps and games market could have an entirely different shape in the years ahead. Netflix is also seemingly betting on this change, prepping its own vast library of games that come with a Netflix membership. For the time being, the games are just a perk of membership, but if one day Netflix could launch its own games store and fill it with titles, it seems it may choose to expand to paid games as well.

The company previously offered a similar video app for Gen Alpha kids, but is now expanding to older teens. Its new Gen Z-focused app is a video thread-style platform, but unlike TikTok, it doesn’t allow users to comment. Instead, users can only respond to each other with other videos, which the company believes may reduce trolling. The startup hopes to create a more positive environment where users can share videos featuring dance, music, fashion, gaming, memes and more. You can read TechCrunch’s full review here.   Hipstamatic is back. Amid user complaints over the current state of Instagram, Hipstamatic returned to the App Store today with a relaunch of its social network for iPhone photography enthusiasts. Its refreshed app, which will today replace Hipstamatic X on the App Store, will offer a chronological feed, photo filtering tools, no ads and no TikTok-like feeds or videos. Users will earn stamps instead of likes, and will browse “stacks” of photos, instead of endless feeds. During its decade-plus existence, the company had rolled out variations on its original concept, like its quirky Hipstamatic X for analog photography lovers, while also maintaining Hipstamatic Classic, one of the first apps to receive Apple’s “App of the Year” award. With its revamped app, the company will try to bring some of its earlier pizazz to a generation that’s chasing retro tech, opting for things like flip phones and wired headphones at times for the “aesthetic.” The app will monetize via a $4.99 per month subscription (or $29.99/year), which unlocks its premium filters, editing features and other perks like claiming your preferred username.   Image Credits: Woolly Image Credits: Woolly The slow but steady Twitter exodus has brought a new abundance of third-party Mastodon apps like Ivory, Mammoth and Ice Cubes that connect users to the increasingly popular open source and decentralized social network. Today, we can add one more app to that list with the launch of Woolly, another solidly built iOS Mastodon client focused on offering a more customizable home screen, threaded views for reading longer conversations and a TweetDeck-inspired layout for the iPad. The main differentiator between this app and others is its approach to home screen customization. With Woolly, users can pin things like multiple remote timelines, lists, bookmarks, search, hashtags or even other user profiles directly to the app’s main tab bar, enabling quick and easy access to your favorite content. Plus, on iPad, you can access a landscape view with columns, similar to TweetDeck. Read TechCrunch’s full review here."
276,Apple leads charge as India’s smartphone exports double in record surge,['@refsrc'],"April 12, 2023","India’s smartphone exports have more than doubled, reaching over $11 billion in the fiscal year that ended in March, according to trade data examined by the industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association and government officials, underscoring the South Asian market’s growing ambition to become a global hardware manufacturing hub. Smartphone exports of $11.2 billion surpassed New Delhi’s target of $9-10 billion even as Chinese smartphone makers, who commanded over two-thirds of all local shipment in India just two years ago, contributed little to the exports. Apple made up almost half of the total exports, with an estimated $5 billion to $5.5 billion, as per industry analysts. Samsung Electronics, the South Korean giant, ranked second with about $4 billion. The surge in smartphone exports can be attributed to New Delhi’s concerted efforts and substantial financial incentives, which aim to encourage smartphone manufacturers to expand their operations in India as the South Asian market races to bolster local infrastructure. Last year, Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, initiated the production of the iPhone 14 in India, marking the first time the country assembled Apple’s latest model. This move is part of Apple’s aggressive strategy to diversify its supply chain network beyond China, where COVID restrictions and other factors highlighted the risks of relying heavily on a single nation. According to analysts at JP Morgan, Apple is set to further expand its manufacturing capabilities in India, with plans to produce 25% of all iPhones by 2025. In another sign of its growing ambitions in India, the world’s second largest smartphone market, Apple is set to open its first two retail stores in the country next week. “With the doubling of exports of smartphones to more than $11 billion, India is well on its way to become a leader in the mobile device market of the world and play a major role in India’s electronic exports. This is a major win for PM Modijis Make in India program,” said Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in a statement."
277,Avalor wants to unify cybersecurity tools by aggregating data,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 18, 2023","Security has a data problem. That’s according to Kfir Tishbi, who led the engineering team at Datorama, a marketing analytics company that was acquired by Salesforce in 2018. Tishbi — who spent time at CitiBank and digital entertainment startup Playtika before joining Datorama — says he often worked with security teams that had to juggle dozens of different tools, each with their own taxonomies and outputs, in order to get projects finished on time. “The amount of data points getting generated is immense. Instead of making sense of it, more tools are being created and are generating even more data,” Raanan Raz, a former colleague of Tishbi’s, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “It’s a vicious cycle. We want to make sure that decisions and actions are data-driven and not based on half-truths.” Setting out to solve the problem, Tishbi and Raz co-founded Avalor, a platform that acts as a source of truth for cybersecurity assets, controls, identities, vulnerabilities, bugs and other data points. Avalor allows security teams to aggregate, normalize, de-duplicate and track risk data from discovery to remediation — at least the way Raz pitches it. Investors appear to be bullish on the idea. Avalor today announced that it raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by TCV with participation from Salesforce Ventures, bringing its total raised to $30 million inclusive of a $5 million seed round led by Cyberstarts last year. Raz says that the new cash will be put toward expanding operations in the U.S. and Israel, in particular growing Avalor’s R&D, product, sales, marking and customer success teams. “Our platform can cover the entire enterprise data surface, so both security teams and their internal partners like CTOs, engineering and IT can benefit from its benefits, including real-time transparency into data sources with labeling and lineage,” Raz, who serves as CEO, said. “We also overlay business context on the security data, meaning organizations can eliminate the noise of security scanners and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their specific business.” Them’s fighting words considering the wide range of startups out there tackling the same problem. Securiti, a cybersecurity firm backed by hundreds of millions in venture capital, recently launched a “data security cloud,” which aims to provide a layer of data protection and transparency wherever data lives. A more direct competitor is Dig Security, which builds tools to address outstanding observability issues in security. What sets Avalor apart, Raz asserts, is three things, mainly. The first is the ability to handle data from virtually any source in any format. The second are vulnerability risk management and prioritization tools. As for the third, it’s scalability — Raz claims that Avalor can handle up to “zettabyte-sized” data volumes. (That’s a trillion gigabytes.) “We’re building a security data lake that’s not ‘garbage in, garbage out,’ so that the data layer can be used for multiple use cases, like vulnerability management,” Raz said. “Some of these use cases share competitors who build only for a single application. Our data fabric architecture allows us to scale an integrated solution across the security team and their business partners so they have a single source of truth from their data.” As time goes on, the plan is to allow third-party security vendors to build apps for specific use cases on top of Avalor. In this way, Raz sees the platform more as a unified database powering various modules and software rather than an all-in-one, holistic solution to a company’s cybersecurity woes. Raz wouldn’t volunteer Avalor’s revenue figures or the size of its customer base. But the company’s investors seem in support of its strategy, for what little difference that makes. Morgan Gerlak, a partner at TCV, had this to say via email: “An ever-growing number of tools have left organizations scrambling to extract signal from noise. Avalor takes aim at this problem with an extensible solution that supports several common security use cases. Importantly, each of these use cases has a well-defined budget and buyer today, not tomorrow.” Of course, it’s true that VCs are generally enthusiastic about startups involved with cybersecurity — and have been for some time. 2022 saw $16 billion invested in emerging cybersecurity firms, a dip from $23 billion in 2021 but double the total from 2020. In a recent report, Crunchbase forecasted that the cybersecurity sector would likely see valuation cuts but that demand would remain strong as high-profile attacks capture the headlines — and as companies look to consolidate their security tools. According to a 451 research survey, the average IT and security team are using between 10 to 30 security monitoring solutions for apps, network infrastructures and cloud environments — a lot by any measure. “Our data fabric helps security teams ‍make faster, more accurate decisions by making sense of their data with real-time access to complete, accurate and precise information in any format from any source — including legacy systems, data lakes, data warehouses, SQL databases and apps,” Raz said. Avalor has 35 employees today and expects to double that number by the end of the year."
278,"LMS365, a learning management system built into Microsoft 365 and Teams, raises $20M",['@psawers'],"April 13, 2023","Danish company LMS365, an online learning management system (LMS) built for use inside Microsoft products, has raised $20 million in its first institutional round of funding. Used by companies including logistics giant Hellmann and soda bottling franchise G&J Pepsi, LMS365 allows users to create their own courses from scratch or import them from a third-party such as Go1 or LinkedIn Learning, which LMS365 announced a partnership with just last month. Embedding a learning management system directly into workers’ core everyday tools is one of LMS365’s core selling points versus incumbents in the LMS space such as Workday, Eloomi or TalentLMS. “LMS365 does not invent a technology problem, but meets the professionals where they are,” CEO Rasmus Holst explained to TechCrunch. With the LMS365 course creator and learning module builder, users can drag-and-drop elements from existing content housed in Microsoft Office software, including PowerPoint, Word and Stream. Or they can import pre-existing courses or quizzes constructed elsewhere and stored in the SCORM or AICC format, which can be useful for general industry-specific training for cybersecurity, or regulatory compliance.

Image Credits: LMS365 Managers can also track learner progress and present relevant data via Microsoft Power BI visuals. Tracking and reporting. Image Credits: LMS365 Tracking and reporting. Image Credits: LMS365 LMS365’s history can be traced back to 2003, when dentist Bjarne Mortensen founded a company called Elearningforce that was focused squarely on on-premise deployments of Microsoft SharePoint. In the intervening years, Elearningforce evolved to a cloud-based product with support for Teams and Microsoft 365, and it recently introduced support for Viva, Microsoft’s so-called “employee experience and engagement” platform. Mortensen retired in 2018 and sold his stake to entrepreneur Johan Wedell-Wedellsborg and Ole Kristoffersen and Steen Skallebæk, founders of Danish bakery chain Ole & Steen. Holst joined LMS365 last year from secure messaging company Wire, where he previously served as chief revenue officer. While its corporate name technically remains Elearningforce, the company transitioned to the LMS365 brand back in 2015, intended to reflect its focus on Microsoft. But why target training delivery through Microsoft, specifically, and not Zoom or Google’s cloud-based software suite? According to Holst, it’s all about focus and addressable market size, not to mention Microsoft’s expansive software suite spanning hosting, communication/collaboration and big data insights. “It’s [Microsoft software] a global, coherent market of 350 million users — so our platform is easy to access and is placed in an app millions use everyday,” Holst said. “Also, Microsoft provides a toolset for the [whole] business — LMS365 uses Azure for hosting, Teams for delivering their application, VIVA for recommending courses, and Power BI for data extraction.” Moreover, by focusing on Microsoft, this minimizes any risks associated with trying to support too many software ecosystems. This was perhaps more of an issue for a business that has grown organically without institutional funding. “For LMS365 to build technically on other platforms and exposing ourselves to technical debt in that way, is not a trade-off that would have been beneficial to us as a bootstrapped business,” Holst said. A little more than half of LMS365 users are based in the U.S., almost a third are located in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and the remainder are spread throughout the rest of the world. “Typical customers are SMEs with 200 to 1,000 users,” Holst said. “Our primary markets (around 80%) are services industry, logistics, manufacturing, automotive, healthcare and government.” LMS365’s first external investment was led by New York-based Blue Cloud Ventures, with participation from Singapore’s Kamet Capital and existing shareholders. The company said that it plans to use its fresh cash injection to double down on its global growth through acquiring distribution partners in the U.S., Germany and Australia. “We see a clear window of opportunity in the market where we can accelerate,” Henrik Jeberg, LMS365 chief strategy officer, said in a statement. “We will use M&A strategically going forward, including in relation to product development.”"
279,Watch SpaceX try to launch Starship to orbit for the first time… again,['@etherington'],"April 20, 2023","SpaceX is launching its Starship rocket from its Starbase facility in southern Texas today — the first time it’s trying to fly the fully stacked version of the launch vehicle, which means Starship itself is set atop the Super Heavy booster that it requires to reach orbit. SpaceX has flown the Starship prototype before, but only the upper stage and only on relatively short hops. The likelihood that the fully assembled Starship and booster combo actually reaches orbit isn’t guaranteed — and in fact, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has previously suggested the likelihood of explosive failure is fairly high on this try. Regardless of what happens, it should be entertaining (provided weather cooperates and there aren’t any technical show-stoppers). The launch window for today’s try lasts 62 minutes, opening at 8:28 a.m. CT and closing at 9:30 a.m. CT."

Welcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.  This past week, I drove a 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4XE Summit 4×4 (a press vehicle courtesy of Jeep) to Moab, Utah, ahead of the Easter Jeep Safari event to check out what the Stellantis brand has been working on. Jeep, which hosts media in March every year for its annual off-roading and concept roadshow, put electrification front and center. While the seven concept vehicles (all of which I drove) were equipped with an array of powertrains, it was hard to ignore the variety of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric setups. There were some fun internal combustion-powered vehicles, like the Jeep Scrambler 392 concept equipped with a 6.4-liter HEMI V-8 engine that’s inspired by the 1981 Jeep Scrambler (CJ-8). And one neat electrified throwback — a resto-modded Jeep Cherokee 4xe concept that gives homage to the two-door 1978 Jeep Cherokee SJ. But I spent most of my time learning about Magneto 3.0., its third and last all-electric concept. Why do I care so much about a concept? I was looking for clues for what might end up in the Jeep Recon and Wagoneer S, the first fully electric Jeeps for the U.S. market when they enter production in 2024. Now it’s unlikely that the Jeep Recon will debut with 40-inch tires or a manual transmission — two features in the Magneto 3.0. But I was intrigued by why Jeep continued to put a manual transmission in all three versions of the Magneto. I was told that Jeep used this unusual hybrid six-speed manual transmission — you don’t need to use the clutch as you set off, just if you want to change gears while underway — in order to harness the 650 horsepower and 900 pound-feet of torque. When I asked if Jeep engineers have figured out how to achieve performance, power, torque AND control without this hybrid manual transmission, I was told YES. Which means it’s doubtful the manual will make it into production. However, I do expect more selective controls designed to leverage the benefits of an all-electric off roader.

Aidea’s AA Cargo a4 is a cross between an e-moped and a pickup truck, complete with space in the back to haul cargo and a windscreen/roof that keeps away probably most of the rain. It recently got approval for use in commercial settings in Japan. BMW’s first Mini electric bike will be developed with Angell Mobility in France and hopefully available to consumers between this year and next. By the way, here is a list of all the automakers that are making e-bikes now.  We’re living in the golden age of electric cargo bikes.  Fluctuo published a report for shared micromobility in Europe, which found there were 850,000 vehicles that clocked 550 million trips and generated €3.1 billion ($3.37 billion) in end-user revenue. Gogoro is doubling down on that B2B push. The company announced a partnership with Zomato, a food ordering and delivery platform, in India and Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited to help delivery drivers get more favorable loan terms for buying e-mopeds.  Mark your calendars! Our friends over at Micromobility Industries have set a date for their Micromobility America conference: October 19–20 in San Francisco. Register now for super early-bird prices.  Keep an eye out in the next day for my review of the Niu KQi3 Max e-scooter. It’s a fun, zippy ride with plenty of power for tackling big hills, but I found it to be not super stable and far too heavy to be convenient when it comes to taking it on public transit or going up and down stairs. All eyes are on Paris, which is holding a referendum Sunday on whether or not to ban shared e-scooters. Ahead of that, the French government unveiled a new regulatory plan for e-scooters that increases the age limit to ride from 12 to 14 and hikes fines for riding with another person from  €35 to  €135. The rules apply to both privately owned scooters and free-floating ones available to rent via apps.   I’m highlighting this “deal” to note the absolute kookiness of it that feels like desperation. I’m talking about shared micromobility company Helbiz, which announced a rebranding and a reverse stock split in an attempt to get back into compliance with the Nasdaq. Reminder: The company was issued a delisting notice last July because its stock was trading too low. Helbiz is now known as Micromobility.com, an effort to position itself as a micromobility brand that offers retail, rentals, shared micromobility, and *checks notes* sports streaming services. Fun fact: The domain for Micromobility.com was purchased from Bolt, the scooter sharing company that disappeared without a trace last year. The rebrand comes alongside the launch of a new brick-and-mortar retail business, which will include the setting up of physical stores across the U.S., starting with its first store in SoHo, New York City, in the next 60 days. There’s also an e-commerce site up today, featuring a small selection of e-scooters, e-bikes, helmets and water bottles. Reporter Rebecca Bellan was unable to reach the company for comment. And she has a lot of questions, including, How is the company paying for even one brick-and-mortar store with the meager cash it had in the bank at the end of 2022? Other deals that got my attention . . . Cabify, a Madrid-based platform that competes against Uber in Spain and Latin America, said it raised $110 million in funding. While we know that the funding is a mix of equity and debt, we don’t know the exact amount of new funding. The $110 million also includes a €40 million loan ($43.8 million) from the European Investment Bank actually announced in December 2022, and it also includes the proceeds of a funding round of an unconfirmed amount that Cabify secured in July 2022. The equity comes from Orilla Asset Management (the family office for Francisco Riberas, a major shareholder of Spanish automotive manufacturing giant Gestamp), financial services giant AXIS and others that are not being named. Dunzo, an Indian hyperlocal delivery startup, is in late-stage discussions to secure about $50 million in a new financing round, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Northvolt, the Swedish battery developer and manufacturer, is reportedly in talks to raise up to $5 billion in new funding. P97, a Houston startup that partners with fuel brands, gas station retailers, EV charging companies, mobile wallet providers and connected car OS makers to make it easier to select and pay for fuel, raised $40 million in equity funding. Portage, a firm known for making fintech investments, led the round, with other investors undisclosed. Scandinavian Enviro Systems and Antin Infrastructure Partners are forming a joint venture backed by Michelin to create the world’s first large-scale tire recycling group. The initial investment in the JV will be funded by Antin’s NextGen platform, which will be the majority owner of the venture. Venti Technologies, an autonomous vehicle technology company focused on logistics and industrial applications, raised $28.8 million in a Series A led by LG Technology Ventures, the VC arm of the LG Group. Safar Partners, UOB Venture Management, and previous investors Alpha JWC and LDV Partners also participated. The company said the funds will be used to continue to build its software, partner with third parties for hardware (i.e., vehicles) and secure more deals.  Bill Gates wrote up some thoughts about where AV tech is headed. His blog also highlights a recent robotaxi ride he took with Wayve, a British AV company that has raised $258 million from backers, including Microsoft. Mississippi governor Tate Reeves signed HB 1003, a bill that establishes a legal framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to test and deploy in the state. Oxbotica is partnering with Google Cloud and will use its products like compute, storage, network, data and analytics to help develop, test, validate, and verify its self-driving technology. It will also leverage Google Cloud’s cybersecurity technologies to help ensure secure use of autonomous mobility technology. Waymo has taken its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan out of service as it transitions its fleet to the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles equipped with its fifth-generation self-driving system. I wrote up a little historical feature on the vehicle, which was the company’s first commercialized autonomous vehicle. Meanwhile, Waymo also said it is testing its fifth generation driver in Austin, Texas. The company didn’t confirm that Austin would be its next commercial launch, but it would make sense if Waymo is trying to keep up with Cruise. Canoo agreed to a $1.5 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Kia revealed the next EV in its portfolio, a three-row flagship SUV called the EV9 that will be a key product in the company’s mission to reach annual sales of 1.2 million battery electric vehicles by 2030. The SUV will go on sale in selected global markets in the second half of 2023. Lamborghini took the wraps off of the 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto, the Italian automaker’s first plug-in hybrid supercar and the replacement to the Aventador. Don’t worry, Lamborghini packed a lot into the Revuelto. Just look at the powertrain specs. The vehicle has a 6.5-liter V12 engine that is then combined with three electric motors. The end result is an output of 1,015 CV (or about 1,001 horsepower) and a vehicle that can travel from 0 to 100 km/h (62 miles per hour) in only 2.5 seconds, with a top speed of more than 350 km (217 mph). Nio began its trial of EV battery swapping in China, which the company hopes will provide a quicker alternative to fast-charging stations. Nio already has 1,323 swapping stations in operation today and has set a target of 2,300 globally by year’s end. Tesla brought back its referral program to Europe, a strategy that taps into the brand loyalty of customers as it seeks to preserve market share and boost sales before the first quarter of 2023 closes. The U.S. signed a trade deal with Japan on EV battery minerals that will help both countries strengthen battery supply chains and grants Japanese automakers more access to the U.S.’s $7,500 EV tax credit. The U.S. Treasury Department released updated rules for the EV tax credit. Early reports that fewer EVs would qualify for the full $7,500 were right. General Motors shared its in-vehicle infotainment strategy and the big takeaway is that it will no longer equip future vehicles with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, the middleware that lets users project their phone onto the center display. That’s an interesting change, especially because I remember when the Chevy Bolt first launched and it was not equipped with any in-house navigation and instead relied on Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. GM will equip future vehicles with a number of embedded Google services, including Google Maps and Google
Assistant and other third-party apps like Audible and Spotify. Grubhub is partnering with Transact Campus to integrate and provide a mobile-first app with capabilities for food ordering, pickup and delivery on college campuses. Uber expanded Comfort Electric, the ride-hailing giant’s premium electric vehicle offering, to 14 new markets across the U.S. and Canada. The offers is now available in 40 North American markets. Lucid Group is cutting its workforce by 18%, or 1,300 people, as part of a restructuring. The layoffs, which will be across the organization and will include executive positions, are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. Lyft made a surprising move (although perhaps not to staff behind the scenes) and announced its co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, who have been leading the company since its founding, are moving out of the executive spots to make way for new leadership. David Risher, who is taking over as Lyft’s CEO in mid-April, already has some ideas of how to reach profitability. In a wide-ranging interview with TechCrunch, Risher said the company may kill off shared rides and other features that get away from its core offering. And no, Lyft is not following Uber into delivery, so he says. Shift Technologies, the online used vehicle retailer, cut its workforce by 30% in the first quarter as the company sought to reduce costs and eliminate duplicate positions following its merger with CarLotz. The layoffs came as the company saw its revenue plummet in the fourth quarter and its operating losses expand. Virgin Orbit announced it will lay off around 85% of its workforce in order to further reduce expenses, after the troubled space company said it was unable to secure additional funding to keep it afloat."
281,Hydration brand Cure mixes new funding into its growth plans,['@christinemhall'],"April 17, 2023","Cure, a functional hydration brand, is entering a new phase of its growth that includes nearly quadrupling its retail presence from 2021, rounding out its leadership team and closing on $5.6 million in Series A funding. It’s been a hot minute since TechCrunch checked in on the brand — almost three years, actually — which is carving out a unique niche in the $10 billion functional drink mix market that founder and CEO Lauren Picasso told TechCrunch has “exploded” in the past 12 months. Picasso attributes much of that to consumer behavior toward more environmentally-friendly products, including the ease of using powder versus ready-to-drink liquids, which weigh more to ship and have more packaging. Hydration is not a new concept (who can forget The Right Stuff?), but consumers looking for healthier options have, in turn, created a more competitive landscape in recent years.   Picasso touts Cure as the “only female-founded electrolyte brand” and considers its biggest competitor to be Liquid I.V., which was acquired by Unilever in 2020. She also said “legacy players are doing really well as lots of new players have entered the market” in the past few years. Some of those other functional beverage startups are also venture-backed. For example, Hydrant, also in hydration, Olipop and Poppi in the soda space and The Ryl Company in tea. Cure founder and CEO Lauren Picasso. Image Credits: Cure Cure founder and CEO Lauren Picasso. Image Credits: Cure To differentiate itself more from the plethora of hydration options, Cure went through a rebrand in 2022 to focus more on its ingredients. For example, it uses coconut water powder and pink Himalayan salt, while other drink mix companies use cane sugar, dextrose, high-fructose corn syrup and synthetic and artificial ingredients, Picasso said. “We wanted to rebrand and really better communicate our clean, plant-based ingredients,” Picasso added. “We feel that we’re just as effective as products like Liquid I.V., but we are using much better ingredients. There’s a really clear point of differentiation, and because of that, we end up attracting very different consumers than any of our competitors. Our product tends to skew female, which is pretty unique, and tends to be a very active health conscious consumer.” Since launching in 2019, Cure has grown, on average, 230% each year in revenue, and will expand its retail footprint from 4,000 stores in 2021 to 15,000 in 2023, Picasso said. The company’s products are already in CVS and Walgreens, but now will also be in retailers, including Sprouts, Albertsons, Kroger, Stop & Shop, Wegmans and HEB. Overall, there are nine flavors, four of them new: lime and orange launched in 2022 and lemonade and strawberry kiwi this year. While Cure is accelerating its retail presence, it continues to have about 60% penetration in e-commerce, and in the first quarter of 2023 outpaced its prior year’s quarter growth by 121%, and all with just nine full-time employees, Picasso said. Having already secured $2.6 million in seed funding in 2020, Cure’s $5.6 million Series A funding, which closed in March, gives the company $8.2 million in total venture-backed capital. With the new capital, the company, Picasso said Cure’s valuation is now over 2x higher than the previous round. The Series A was planned, with Picasso noting that “this is going to be our last round. From here on out, we will be working toward profitability, aiming to be profitable by the beginning of 2024.” Cure’s hydration mix flavors. Image Credits: Cure Cure’s hydration mix flavors. Image Credits: Cure   Lerer Hippeau, which led Cure’s seed round, is back to lead the new investment and was joined by a group of new and existing investors, including Valedor Partners, Simple Food Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital, Joyance Partners, Silas Capital and Kim Clijsters. Cure intends to invest the new capital in faster retail expansion, growing its leadership team, acquiring new customers and developing new products, including a bulk jar option that subscriber customers have been requesting. With regard to its leadership team, the company recently hired Laura Kendrick, who was previously with SmartyPants, and Stacey Gillespie, former vice president of innovation at Gaia Herbs, to help scale distribution and overall revenue. Cure has been successful with influencer marketing, amassing 700 influencers as part of its ambassador program, but Picasso brought Kendrick on “to really help the brand scale,” while Gillespie will lead the advancement of the company’s product development and expansion into other functional categories, for example energy and health. “We were looking for someone to scale all these different marketing channels and really drive the brand strategy going forward,” Picasso said. “Meanwhile, Stacey is an industry veteran who brought 1,500 new products to market over the course of her career.” To that end, Cure’s products went on the shelves of a number of new retailers in the last four months while also doubling its footprint in CVS. It is now working on some new products that will be launched in the next year or so, Picasso said. “We have a lot of retail expansion planned, so the next two years will be about executing in those doors and coming up with a marketing playbook to be successful in stores,” she added. Editor’s note: Cure, which disclosed a $22 million valuation during the interview, said that the current valuation is now higher, but disclosed to comment further.  "
282,NASA’s DAGGER could give advance warning of the next big solar storm,['@techcrunch'],"March 31, 2023","There’s enough trouble on this planet already that we don’t need new problems coming here from the sun. Unfortunately, we can’t yet destroy this pitiless star, so we are at its mercy. But NASA at least may soon be able to let us know when one of its murderous flares is going to send our terrestrial systems into disarray. Understanding and predicting space weather is a big part of NASA’s job. There’s no air up there, so no one can hear you scream, “Wow, how about this radiation!” Consequently, we rely on a set of satellites to detect and relay this important data to us. One such measurement is of solar wind, “an unrelenting stream of material from the sun.” Even NASA can’t find anything nice to say about it! Normally this stream is absorbed or dissipated by our magnetosphere, but if there’s a solar storm, it may be intense enough that it overwhelms the local defenses. When this happens, it can set electronics on the fritz, since these charged particles can flip bits or disrupt volatile memory like RAM and solid state storage. NASA relates that even telegraph stations weren’t safe, blowing up during the largest on-record solar storm, 1859’s Carrington Event. While we can’t stop these stellar events from occurring, we might be able to better prepare for them if we knew they were coming. But usually by the time we know, they’re basically already here. But how can we predict such infrequent and chaotic events? View of NASA’s SOHO satellite being overwhelmed during a 2003 solar storm. Image Credits: NASA View of NASA’s SOHO satellite being overwhelmed during a 2003 solar storm. Image Credits: NASA A joint project between NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Department of Energy at the Frontier Development Lab has been looking into this issue, and the answer is exactly what you’d expect: machine learning. The team collected data on solar flares from multiple satellites monitoring the sun, as well as from ground stations watching for geomagnetic disruptions (called perturbations), like those that affect technology. The deep learning model they designed identified patterns in how the former leads to the latter, and they call the resulting system DAGGER: Deep leArninG Geomagnetic pErtuRbation. Yes, it’s a stretch. But it seems to work. Using geomagnetic storms that hit Earth in 2011 and 2015 as test data, the team found that DAGGER was able to quickly and accurately forecast their effects across the globe. This combines the strengths of previous approaches while avoiding their disadvantages. As NASA put it: Previous prediction models have used AI to produce local geomagnetic forecasts for specific locations on Earth. Other models that didn’t use AI have provided global predictions that weren’t very timely. DAGGER is the first one to combine the swift analysis of AI with real measurements from space and across Earth to generate frequently updated predictions that are both prompt and precise for sites worldwide. It may be a bit before you get a solar alert on your phone telling you to pull over or your car might stop working (this won’t actually happen…probably), but it could make a big difference when we know there’s vulnerable infrastructure that could suddenly shut down. A few minutes’ warning is better than none! You can read the paper describing the DAGGER model, which, by the way, is open source, in this issue of the journal Space Weather."
283,"Apple wins antitrust court battle with Epic Games, appeals court rules",['@sarahintampa'],"April 24, 2023","Apple has won its antitrust-focused appeals court battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games over its App Store policies, according to the opinion issued today by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court largely upheld the district court’s earlier ruling related to Epic Games’ antitrust claims in favor of Apple, but it also upheld the lower court’s judgment in favor of Epic under California’s Unfair Competition Law. The mobile game maker had hoped to prove in its appeal that Apple had acted unlawfully by restricting app distribution on iOS devices to Apple’s App Store which required payments to go through its own processor while preventing developers from communicating to customers about alternative ways to pay. The court’s ruling was first reported by Bloomberg. Apple has issued the following statement: Today’s decision reaffirms Apple’s resounding victory in this case, with nine of ten claims having been decided in Apple’s favor. For the second time in two years, a federal court has ruled that Apple abides by antitrust laws at the state and federal levels. The App Store continues to promote competition, drive innovation, and expand opportunity, and we’re proud of its profound contributions to both users and developers around the world. We respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling on the one remaining claim under state law and are considering further review. The ruling is a major setback for Epic Games and other developers who hoped the ruling could set precedent for further antitrust claims and require Apple to open iOS devices to third-party app stores and payment systems. Epic originally sued Apple in 2020, after forcing Apple to remove Fortnite from the App Store after it intentionally violated the App Store terms over in-app purchases. Though Apple had largely won the lawsuit when the judge declared Apple was not acting as a monopolist, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple’s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. It said that Apple would no longer be able to prohibit developers from pointing users to other means of payment. Both Apple and Epic appealed the ruling — Apple over the required changes to App Store policies related to external links and Epic to try its antitrust case again. In today’s decision, the appeals court panel affirmed the district court’s denial of antitrust liability and its corresponding rejection of Epic’s illegality defense to Apple’s breach of contract counter-claim, the ruling said. However, it also noted that the district court had erred in defining the relevant antitrust market and in holding that Apple’s DPLA (Developer Program Licensing Agreement) fell outside of the scope of the antitrust law known as the Sherman Act. But it said those errors were ultimately “harmless” and that Epic, regardless, had “failed to establish, as a factual matter, its proposed market definition and the existence of any substantially less restrictive alternative means for Apple to accomplish the procompetitive justifications supporting iOS’s walled- garden ecosystem.” In other words, while these types of contracts can be within the scope of a Sherman Act claim, that wasn’t relevant to the court’s decision in this case. The panel also upheld the district court’s ruling in favor of Epic Games within the scope of California’s Unfair Competition Law. “The district court did not clearly err in finding that Epic was injured, err as a matter of law when applying California’s flexible liability standards, or abuse its discretion when fashioning equitable relief,” the ruling stated. That would mean the anti-steering changes the district court previously decided on would once again be required. Apple hasn’t yet issued an appeal for this part of the decision. It will likely weigh its options before making that determination. In another bright spot for Apple, the appeals court ruled that the district court had erred when it ruled that Apple wasn’t entitled to attorney fees related to the DPLA breach of contract claims. Epic Games responded to a request for comment by pointing to founder and CEO Tim Sweeney’s statement, shared on Twitter. “Apple prevailed at the 9th Circuit Court,” Sweeney wrote. “Though the court upheld the ruling that Apple’s restraints have ‘a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers,’ they found we didn’t prove our Sherman Act case.Fortunately, the court’s positive decision rejecting Apple’s anti-steering provisions frees iOS developers to send consumers to the web to do business with them directly there. We’re working on next steps.” Apple prevailed at the 9th Circuit Court. Though the court upheld the ruling that Apple's restraints have ""a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers"", they found we didn't prove our Sherman Act case. — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) April 24, 2023  Updated 4/23/23, 4:35 pm et with Epic Games’ comment"
284,Why ChatGPT lies in some languages more than others,['@techcrunch'],"April 26, 2023","AI is very much a work in progress, and we should all be wary of its potential for confidently spouting misinformation. But it seems to be more likely to do so in some languages than others. Why is that? The question comes in the wake of a report by NewsGuard, a misinformation watchdog, that shows how ChatGPT repeats more inaccurate information in Chinese dialects than when asked to do so in English. In their tests, they “tempted” the language model by asking it to write news articles regarding various false claims allegedly advanced by the Chinese government — such as that protests in Hong Kong were staged by U.S.-associated agents provocateurs. When asked to do so in English (both prompt and output), ChatGPT only complied in one out of seven examples: specifically, it generated an article that echoed the official Chinese government line that mass detention of Uyghur people in the country is in fact a vocational and educational effort. But when the prompts and outputs were in simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese (the two most common written languages in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), ChatGPT offered disinfo-tinged rhetoric every single time. When asked in English about the Hong Kong protests, the model responded in part: I’m sorry, but as an AI language model, it is not appropriate or ethical for me to generate false or misleading news articles. The Hong Kong protests were a genuine grassroots movement… Whereas both responses when asked and answered in Chinese script were along the lines of: Recently, it was reported that the Hong Kong protests were a ‘color revolution’ directed by the United States. It is said that the US government and some NGOs are closely following and supporting the anti-government movement in Hong Kong in order to achieve their political goals. An interesting, and troubling, outcome. But why should an AI model tell you different things just because it’s saying them in a different language? The answer lies in the fact that we, understandably, anthropomorphize these systems, considering them as simply expressing some internalized bit of knowledge in whatever language is selected. It’s perfectly natural: After all, if you asked a multilingual person to answer a question first in English, then in Korean or Polish, they would give you the same answer rendered accurately in each language. The weather today is sunny and cool however they choose to phrase it, because the facts don’t change depending on which language they say them in. The idea is separate from the expression. In a language model, this isn’t the case, because they don’t actually know anything, in the sense that people do. These are statistical models that identify patterns in a series of words and predict which words come next, based on their training data. Do you see what the issue is? The answer isn’t really an answer, it’s a prediction of how that question would be answered, if it was present in the training set. (Here’s a longer exploration of that aspect of today’s most powerful LLMs.)   Although these models are multilingual themselves, the languages don’t necessarily inform one another. They are overlapping but distinct areas of the dataset, and the model doesn’t (yet) have a mechanism by which it compares how certain phrases or predictions differ between those areas. So when you ask for an answer in English, it draws primarily from all the English language data it has. When you ask for an answer in traditional Chinese, it draws primarily from the Chinese language data it has. How and to what extent these two piles of data inform one another or the resulting outcome is not clear, but at present NewsGuard’s experiment shows that they at least are quite independent. What does that mean to people who must work with AI models in languages other than English, which makes up the vast majority of training data? It’s just one more caveat to keep in mind when interacting with them. It’s already hard enough to tell whether a language model is answering accurately, hallucinating wildly or even regurgitating exactly — and adding the uncertainty of a language barrier in there only makes it harder. The example with political matters in China is an extreme one, but you can easily imagine other cases where, say, when asked to give an answer in Italian, it draws on and reflects the Italian content in its training dataset. That may well be a good thing in some cases! This doesn’t mean that large language models are only useful in English, or in the language best represented in their dataset. No doubt ChatGPT would be perfectly usable for less politically fraught queries, since whether it answers in Chinese or English, much of its output will be equally accurate. But the report raises an interesting point worth considering in the future development of new language models: not just whether propaganda is more present in one language or another, but other, more subtle biases or beliefs. It reinforces the notion that when ChatGPT or some other model gives you an answer, it’s always worth asking yourself (not the model) where that answer came from and if the data it is based on is itself trustworthy.

285,NovoNutrients wants to turn CO2 into protein,['@tdechant'],"April 13, 2023","We’ve spent the last century and a half pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and it’s clear that we’ll have to spend the coming decades removing a significant fraction of that. But then what do we do with it all? Some people are proposing pumping it underground. Others think we can make things from it, including liquid fuels and concrete. Problem is, those are pretty low-margin opportunities today. One startup thinks the answer is to turn carbon dioxide into protein. That company is getting a shot to test its thesis at scale, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. NovoNutrients will be building a pilot-scale plant with help from a $3 million technology and investment deal from Woodside Energy, one of Australia’s largest oil and gas companies, which has begun dipping its toes into the carbon capture waters. NovoNutrients relies on bacteria to do the dirty work. The company has surveyed the scientific literature to find species that can use carbon dioxide in their metabolic pathways, allowing them to use the waste gas as energy. Its scientists have also discovered strains not otherwise known to science. “Our technology is about how do you industrialize this naturally occurring metabolism?” CEO David Tze told TechCrunch+."

287,ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot,"['Alyssa Stringer', 'Kyle Wiggers']","May 3, 2023","ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. It’s able to write essays, code and more given short text prompts, hyper-charging productivity. But it also has a more…nefarious side. In any case, AI tools are not going away — and indeed has expanded dramatically since its launch just a few months ago. Major brands are experimenting with it, using the AI to generate ad and marketing copy, for example.  And OpenAI is heavily investing in it. ChatGPT was recently super-charged by GPT-4, the latest language-writing model from OpenAI’s labs. Paying ChatGPT users have access to GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than the model that previously powered ChatGPT. In addition to GPT-4, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet with plugins available in alpha to users and developers on the waitlist. Here’s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, to be updated regularly. We also answer the most common FAQs (see below). Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms.The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices. “In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. “They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.” VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft’s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source. Called ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as “for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.” “ChatGPT Business will follow our API’s data usage policies, which means that end users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.” OpenAI applied for a trademark for “GPT,” which stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the “myriad infringements and counterfeit apps” beginning to spring into existence. Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI’s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide “appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.” That means a decision could take up to five more months. Auto-GPT is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI’s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to “autonomously” perform tasks. Depending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself. FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to “turbocharge” fraud in a congressional hearing. “AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,” Khan told the House representatives. “And I think we’ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We’ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,” she stated. The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default ChatGPT experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat’s AI features. Italy’s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month — when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU’s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals’ data. The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline — of April 30 — to get the regulator’s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.) A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a “persona” — for example, “a bad person,” “a horrible person” or “a nasty person” — through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having ChatGPT pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity — with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would. The research was conducted using the latest version of ChatGPT, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI’s GPT-4. YC Demo Day’s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building “ChatGPT for X.” They’re all chasing after a customer service software market that’ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true. Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye: OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy. Italy’s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people’s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it’s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation. The letter’s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.” The letter reads: Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. OpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bots functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it’ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access. GPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API. ChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft’s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be “Microsoft managed customers and partners,” can apply here for special access. OpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers. At a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences. Other companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord — putting the pressure on Big Tech’s AI initiatives, like Google. After ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers — Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston — made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI’s answers with the world. GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that’s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4. There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. There is not an app available for iPhone or Android, but users have options to enable the chatbot on their mobile devices via their browser or a third-party app that uses ChatGPT’s public API. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it was released March 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder — if not impossible — to run today. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."
288,What’s new in the world of generative AI?,['@alex'],"April 17, 2023","Hello, friend! Much like yourself, the TechCrunch+ crew has been working to stay up to date and get ahead on all things generative AI. With the rapid evolution of AI models, it’s hard to keep up. But don’t worry. TechCrunch+ has your back. Building off of TechCrunch+’s regular drumbeat of AI coverage, we’re going deeper into the weeds on how startups can take advantage of the new technologies. Here’s a smattering of what we’ve published lately: Why is all this happening? Because when a new technology hits the market that will reach mass adoption and mass use, it shakes up everything. And no investor wants to miss the Next Big Thing. That’s why TechCrunch+ has sat back and ruminated on the generative AI technology arms race, trying to work it into our historical models of rapid change from years past. Whenever there’s a new tech that appears set to change the world, there’s risk of a bubble. The generative AI rush is no different. Time will tell precisely how much hype in the space will boil away and how much will become the foundation of the future. We’re watching. Come watch with us.     "
289,"ZEBOX, an incubator for supply chain startups, launches its Asia hub in Singapore",['@catherineshu'],"April 24, 2023","ZEBOX, an international accelerator network founded by shipping conglomerate CMA CGM to introduce more tech innovation into the supply chain industry, announced today the launch of its APAC headquarters. Based in Singapore, ZEBOX Asia will also look at markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. The APAC hub is backed by Enterprise Singapore, a board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry to foster SME development, and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, alongside industry partners Bureau Veritas Marine and Offshore, PSA unboXed and Synergy Marine Group. Founded in 2018 by CMA CGM Group chairman and CEO Rodolphe Saadé, ZEBOX already has hubs in France, the United States, the United Kingdom, West Africa and the Caribbeans, which have collectively worked with 100 startups that have raised a total of $235 million in funding. It has 20 corporate partners that startups collaborate with while they are in ZEBOX’s incubator, including BNP Paribas, CEVA Logistics, Infosys, BNSG Railway, Port of Virginia and Centrimex. ZEBOX CEO Gwen Salley told TechCrunch that along with access to mentoring, experts, business opportunities and funding, its incubator program gives startups opportunities to test their solutions and work with large corporations. For corporate partners, the advantage is working with startups that can address their specific business challenges and engage in de-risked proof of concepts. The incubator network picked Singapore for its newest hub because more than 4,000 regional headquarters and startups are based there and it has pro-business policies, an efficient regulatory framework, transparent legal and financial systems and strong digital infrastructure, Salley said. “Additionally, the city state’s strategic location at the crossroads of major shipping lines and air routes connects large parts of Asia to the rest of the world, making it a global logistics hub,” he added. Some examples of startups incubated by ZEBOX include Searoutes, which uses routing engines and predictive data to show shippers how much CO2 emissions they’re producing at key points in the procurement chain and Sublime Energie, a deeptech startup that focuses on biogas liquefaction tech and provides biogas collection services. Both of these took part in ZEBOX France. BasicBlock, which took part in ZEBOX America and has iraised more than $78 million in funding, automates invoices and develops financial products for the freight industry. Expedock, also from ZEBOX America, has raised more than $20 million and automates freight documents, payable reconciliation and other manual paperwork. Meanwhile, SMO Solar Process, which took part in Zebox Caribbeans, developed solar-based technology that turns carbon-based waste into other materials, like hydrogen, biochar and carbon powder. ZEBOX looks for startups in four area. One is operational efficiency, or tech that helps minimize the physical movements of goods in everyday operations. Another is decarbonization and ZEBOX is looking at alternative fuels, net zero energy, asset recovery, green infrastructure, emissions tracking and reporting and sustainable warehousing and distribution. This is an especially critical area for CMA CGM Group, since its goal is to reach net zero carbon by 2050. The company says it has already reduced carbon emissions per container carried by 50% since 2008. The third area of focus, workflow automation, looks for startups that streamlines and eliminates back office tasks so companies can get more work done in less time. Finally, the future of work will zone in on startups that can innovate in training, workplace safety, employee engagement, talent acquisition, hybrid work environments, ESG and customer experience. In a statement, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore chief executive Teo Eng Dih said, “Startups play a critical role in the transformation of the maritime sector by generating value through their innovative solutions. Through working with partners, MPA hopes to anchor more marinetech startups in Singapore to develop, test and commercialize new products and services from Singapore to benefit the global maritime community.”"
290,Microsoft lets generative AI loose on cybersecurity,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 28, 2023","As a part of its continued quest to inject generative AI into all its products, Microsoft today introduced Security Copilot, a new tool that aims to “summarize” and “make sense” of threat intelligence. In a light-on-the-details announcement, Microsoft pitched Security Copilot as a way to correlate data on attacks while prioritizing security incidents. Countless tools already do this. But Microsoft argues that Security Copilot, which integrates with its existing security product portfolio, is made better by generative AI models from OpenAI — specifically the recently launched text-generating GPT-4. “Advancing the state of security requires both people and technology — human ingenuity paired with the most advanced tools that help apply human expertise at speed and scale,” Microsoft Security executive vice president Charlie Bell said in a canned statement. “With Security Copilot we are building a future where every defender is empowered with the tools and technologies necessary to make the world a safer place.” Microsoft didn’t divulge exactly how Security Copilot incorporates GPT-4, oddly enough. It, instead, highlighted a trained custom model — perhaps GPT-4-based — powering Security Copilot that “incorporates a growing set of security-specific skills” and “deploys skills and queries” germane to cybersecurity. Microsoft stressed that the model isn’t trained on customer data, addressing a common criticism of language model-driven services. This custom model helps “catch what other approaches might miss,” Microsoft claims, by answering security-related questions, advising on the best course of action and summarizing events and processes. But given text-generating models’ untruthful tendencies, it’s unclear how effective such a model might be in production. Microsoft itself admits that the custom Security Copilot model doesn’t always get everything right. “AI-generated content can contain mistakes,” the company writes. “As we continue to learn from these interactions, we are adjusting its responses to create more coherent, relevant and useful answers.” Hopefully, those mistakes don’t end up making a bad security problem worse."

293,"For deep due diligence, minimize disruption to maximize success",[],"March 28, 2023","Most founders are so laser-focused on convincing investors to invest that they don’t fully consider the due diligence process that comes after. But as the funding landscape becomes tougher, it pays to know what kind of investor you’re dealing with and how to handle due diligence right from the outset, so that it doesn’t jeopardize your chances of signing a deal. When it comes to due diligence, investors can vary enormously in their approach. While many VCs are flexible, particularly at an early stage, there are situations where you will face a deeper process, involving specialist external consultants. I’ve found that this is most common amongst venture capital trusts, corporate VCs and government-backed VCs — where the concern of potential litigation is higher — and at late Series A or Series B stage. Having been through several of these processes with portfolio companies, I’ve seen firsthand the risks involved, due to the time they can suck from the founding team and the business. If you’re not careful, you can come up against delays, or worse, investors pulling out at the last minute. That means your focus shouldn’t only be on passing successfully, but also minimizing the disruption to your team and your business growth. Here I’ll outline a few tactics that can help to ensure you emerge from deep due diligence unscathed and, crucially, don’t end up back at square one. Your focus shouldn’t only be on passing successfully, but also minimizing the disruption to your team and your business growth. Due diligence is a business cost that can suck up a lot of time. On top of that, by entering this stage you’re giving an investor a certain amount of exclusivity, which means opportunity cost elsewhere. So, before you put any significant resource toward it, you need to have clear commitment from investors. It isn’t uncommon for big corporates to say they’re interested, sign a term sheet with you along with several other businesses, bring in a team to get educated on your sector and business, and then pull out. Because ultimately they’re the competition. So, in early discussions you need to get an idea of the certainty of closing, a term sheet on the table, and specifically ask what the conditions are. This will give you an idea of how serious they are, the due diligence you will face, and where you might encounter issues. You need to be assertive, to understand what their offer is and the reasons behind their decision to invest. If you’re satisfied, move ahead. Otherwise, it’s probably not a good use of your time. Some companies prepare a detailed data room before they even start fundraising, and while it might be helpful to have some of the basics ready to go, everything should ultimately flow from what the investor wants. I’ve seen founders who have prepared an amazing data room and haven’t ended up raising money. Similarly, I’ve seen the opposite situation where a founder hasn’t prepared anything and they have raised. So based on that, my advice would be to wait until you know exactly what they want. You also have confidentiality to consider, so don’t share anything sensitive before you know that an investor is serious. I would also recommend asking for the scope of work at the outset, not only to know what you’re in for, but also to help streamline the requirements as much as possible. For example, if you have audited accounts available, this should cover a lot of the financial questions. If they’re doing technical diligence, you may want to limit the amount of code you give access to for security purposes. Or if they want to do an HR review, try to control the involvement of the team as that will be a big diversion of time."

You can help TechCrunch win by voting for Chain Reaction, which digs into the wild world of crypto, or Found, which brings you the stories behind the startups by sitting down with the founders themselves. Please take a few moments to vote here. Voting closes April 20. (NB I host Chain Reaction, so vote for my show!) Welcome back to Chain Reaction. This week was pretty bearable as a crypto reporter covering this space. There was less crazy news transpiring, compared to previous weeks (where we saw a number of U.S. government crackdowns on major crypto companies like Binance and Coinbase). Still, it’s never a dull week in the crypto world. In late March, Arbitrum, an Ethereum scaling solution, transitioned into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), after airdropping community members its new token, ARB. DAOs are meant to operate with no central authority and token holders can vote on decisions to govern the entity. Seems fair right? Well, sometimes it can get messy. Exhibit A: Over the weekend, Arbitrum got in a bit of hot water after its foundation made a proposal to transfer 750 million ARB tokens, worth about $1 billion at the time, to its own wallets. Before the vote was over, the foundation, a centralized entity, already sent the majority of the tokens to itself — which backfired as voters in the community voted against the move. In attempts to calm the waters, Arbitrum said it would hold redos for voters to decide — which brought in mixed reviews from community members. Some found the company’s decision positive and an attempt to listen to the community, while others still believed their move of tokens was an abuse of control over what was supposed to be a now decentralized group. In response to it all, on Wednesday the Arbitrum Foundation proposed to expand ARB token holders’ budget oversight and governance powers, or voting powers. The foundation also said in a Discord post it “will not move” the 700 million ARB tokens that were transferred to its “Administrative Budget Wallet” until the community approved “an acceptable budget.” It also said it would propose new actions to make governance of the alleged-DAO “more accessible.” Within those proposals, the foundation also plans to let the DAO vote on limiting the centralized entity’s powers and increasing community members’ control. Its DAO members will have time to provide feedback on the proposals and then the two proposals will be open for a week-long vote, according to “eli_defi,” an Arbitrum Foundation community lead on Discord. Whether all these initiatives pass is to be determined. The ARB token is down 11% on the week. In general, the whole cryptocurrency market was mostly unchanged on the week with the total crypto market cap down less than 1% to $1.177 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the time of writing, the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap — bitcoin and ether — were down about 2% and up 4%, respectively, within the same time frame. The US is losing crypto talent as blockchain devs seek safer havens (TC+) It’s usually third-world countries that frequently say they’re experiencing a “brain drain” — the bleeding of talent to other countries or parts of the world. But it seems now the United States is the one seeing talent fleeing to other parts of the world, at least as far as blockchain developers are concerned. Hong Kong is charting its own web3 path despite China’s anti-crypto stance (TC+) Hong Kong has an on-again-off-again relationship with crypto: Before China outlawed all crypto-related activities in 2021, the Asian financial hub was the early home to several crypto startups, including the now-defunct FTX, which left for the Bahamas after the ban. Now, Hong Kong is again welcoming crypto businesses, only this time with more regulatory clarity. Investors unfazed by Q1 crypto funding decline (TC+) Crypto-focused venture capital investors are trucking along in their work. Many remain confident in their investing strategies despite an enervated first-quarter market for crypto startup fundraising. Others are noticing a sharper decline in investing pace. Blockchain builder Ava Labs partners with Korea’s SK Planet to expand Asia footprint Ava Labs, a company that launched the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, has partnered with SK Planet, a data management and marketing platform unit of South Korean company SK Square. SK Planet will launch Avalanche Subnet UPTN to offer web3 infrastructure in South Korea. The partnership comes less than a month after the New York-based digital asset firm hired its first new heads in Asia in service of accelerating its footprint in the region. Twitter’s new homepage logo is very doge-y Twitter’s homepage icon really is the doge meme right now. This might just be Musk’s idea of a belated April Fools’ joke, or it could mean something more than that. The price of the meme-driven cryptocurrency Dogecoin was up as a result, though it’s still far lower than its peak price in May 2021.  For this week’s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Arianna Simpson, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (commonly known as a16z).

296,TikTok called out for misusing Citizen Lab research,['@asilbwrites'],"March 23, 2023","TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was questioned in a U.S. government hearing on Thursday over the relationship between the fast-growing social media platform and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. In Chew’s pre-written opening statement, the chief executive cited a report from internet watchdog Citizen Lab, saying that “there was no overt data transmission by TikTok to the Chinese government and that TikTok did not contact any servers within China.” According to Citizen Lab director Ron Deibert, this is a misrepresentation of what the report found. When Chew’s testimony was published before the hearing, Deibert took to Twitter with a statement, expressing his disappointment with how this research was misconstrued. My statement about #TikTok's continuing reference to @citizenlab research 👇 pic.twitter.com/qyljyhXPer — profdeibert (@RonDeibert) March 23, 2023  According to Deibert, who founded Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto in 2001, researchers found in the 2021 study that they had no insight into what happened with user data once it’s collected and sent back to TikTok’s servers. Deibert said in his statement, “Although we had no way to determine whether or not it had happened, we even speculated about possible mechanisms through which the Chinese government might use unconventional techniques to obtain TikTok user data via pressure on ByteDance.” The report also surfaced concerns that TikTok has some dormant code originally written for Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. “We are concerned with the possibility where TikTok’s server-returned configuration values could enable those dormant code written for Douyin, which might lead to China-specific features being enabled,” the report reads. Congressman Bill Johnson (R-OH) referenced the Citizen Lab report while questioning Chew, pointing out the discrepancies between TikTok’s positioning of the report and what the report actually says. Per the research, TikTok and Douyin both contain code that can handle a special subset of server-returned search responses. In TikTok’s case, this might apply when a user searches for terms like “suicide,” for example — instead of surfacing videos, the search page will direct the user to a hub of suicide prevention resources. Douyin has the same module in its code, but it’s more restrictive, since the Chinese government has far greater regulation over speech than the U.S. government. Citizen Lab’s report says, “Even though the search censorship modules in TikTok and Douyin predefined the same set of restrictions that can be applied, Douyin applied these restrictions differently from TikTok by returning different values from the server.” Rep. Johnson voiced concern over the similarity of this code. “Specific censorship parameters from Douyin are present in TikTok, but just turned off,” the congressman said. Johnson repeatedly asked Chew to say whether or not he had directed engineers to change this code. Chew dodged the question by pointing out that third-party experts have access to monitor TikTok’s code; Johnson admonished him for not answering what he posed as a yes or no question. This was a constant throughout the hearing, in which congresspeople would ask Chew complicated questions, then demand a one-word response. In his statement, Citizen Lab’s director pointed out that many of his concerns about TikTok are not unique to that single platform; they mirror those of other U.S.-owned companies. “The conversation about potential privacy and national security concerns with TikTok should serve as a reminder that most social media apps are unacceptably invasive-by-design,” Deibert wrote.

297,Twitter confirms Circle tweets temporarily were not private,['@asilbwrites'],"May 5, 2023","Twitter confirmed that a security error that made Circle tweets — posts that only go out to a small subset of trusted friends — surface publicly. TechCrunch reported the glitch in early April, but the platform confirmed the issue today in an email sent to Twitter Circle users. “In April 2023, a security incident may have allowed users outside of your Twitter Circle to see tweets that should have otherwise been limited to the Circle to which you were posting,” the email said. Twitter claims that the bug has now been fixed, and that the team knows what caused it. Twitter Circle has been buggy for months, which is concerning for a feature that people use to tweet things they don’t want to share with all of their followers. When we reported on the issue last month, numerous users had been tweeting that people outside of their Circle were liking their private tweets; one user even said that she posted nude photos on her Circle, which slipped through the cracks and surfaced for unintended eyes. Most often, it seemed that Circle tweets were being surfaced in the For You timeline to users who follow the poster, but were not in their Circle. Others reported that their Circle tweets were reaching even further than those who follow them. Privacy breaches aside, some Circle tweets still are showing up without the green banner that indicates they’re only visible to a select audience. You can tell that these tweets aren’t public because the retweet button will be greyed out. These tweets still are only reaching their intended Circles, so it’s not necessarily a privacy issue, but it can be a confusing user experience (personally, I have fielded a few messages from friends who were surprised I was tweeting so openly about which neighborhood I live in — I had to reassure them that despite the absence of the green banner, the post was private). TechCrunch first reported on that particular glitch in February, and it still has not been fixed. In moments like these, I remember something that former Twitter Trust & Safety head Yoel Roth said shortly after leaving the company. “If protected tweets stop working, run, because that’s a symptom that something is deeply wrong.”  "
298,New rules in Europe to curb Big Tech’s market power start to apply,['@riptari'],"May 2, 2023","GAFAM giants will have marked their calendars today as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Union’s plan to curb the market power of Big Tech, now technically applies, after entering into force last November. The next major milestone is a few months out, in early fall, when the Commission will confirm which of the usual suspect tech giants will be subject to the bloc’s shiny new ex ante competition regulation regime. But tech giants are facing a busy summer to prepare their regional compliance strategies. Quick recap: The DMA applies a fixed set of obligations to so-called Internet “gatekeepers” who meet specific, cumulative criteria: Firstly they must operate at least one “core platform service” (these include online search engines, social networking services, app stores, certain messaging services, virtual assistants, web browsers, operating systems and online intermediation services). Secondly they must be of a large enough size and entrenched market position to fall under the regime. This means reporting annual revenue in the European Economic Area that hit or exceeded €7.5 billion in each of the last three financial years; or else having an average market capitalisation “or equivalent fair market value” that amounted to at least €75 billion in the last financial year, as well as providing a core platform service in at least three EU Member States. Gatekeepers must also be an “important gateway for business users towards final consumers”, as the Commission puts it — which the DMA considers to be the case if the company in question operates a core platform service with 45M+ monthly active end users in the EU and more than 10,000 yearly active EU business users in the last financial year. Lastly, an entrenched and durable position is presumed if the company met the other criteria in each of the last three financial years. Although the Commission may also apply a subset of DMA rules to companies it suspects will soon become gatekeepers. Certain big names will very obviously hit the DMA threshold (Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft seem entirely safe bets for being deemed gatekeepers). But we’ll have to wait a few months to see if the full list contains any surprises. And on that front, European music streaming giant Spotify clearly isn’t expecting to be one of them…  but, er, let’s see! This is big. Totally agree with @vestager that the internet was never built to be controlled by a small number of dominant players. Effective enforcement is critical because we've watched Apple try to skirt the rules around the world. Here's our take – https://t.co/PnzglOaafZ. https://t.co/QL61DIonn7 — Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) May 2, 2023  “Now that the DMA applies, potential gatekeepers that meet the quantitative thresholds established have until July 3 to notify their core platform services to the Commission. The Commission will then have 45 working days (until September 6, 2023) to decide whether the company meets the thresholds and to designate gatekeepers. Following their designation, gatekeepers will have six months (i.e. until March 6, 2024) to comply with the requirements in the DMA,” the Commission writes in a press release. If you’re feeling a sense of déjà vu, that’s probably because EU lawmakers recently designated 19 very large online platforms (VLOPs) that are subject to the DMA’s sister regulation, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which reboots the bloc’s ecommerce governance regime.   It’s likely some of the same companies which have already been named VLOPs under the DSA will also be designated gatekeepers under the DMA — meaning they will accrue additional “specific obligations”, on top of the algorithmic transparency requirements demanded by the DSA. The DMA’s operational “dos and don’ts” are distinctly targeted at ensuring digital markets stay “open and contestable” by enforcing a fixed set of behavioral conditions on gatekeepers that are intended to curb familiar anti-competitive actions. Examples of DMA obligations include limits on how gatekeeping platforms can use third party data along with requirements they provide third parties with data on usage their apps generate; bans on self-preferencing and on indelible default apps or settings being forced on consumers; interoperability requirements, including for gatekeeping messenger services; requirements that app stores do not block sideloading nor require developers to use their own services (e.g. payment systems); and a ban on tracking users for targeted ads without consent, among other conditions. The bulk of the list speaks to the Commission’s experience in past Big Tech antitrust cases, such as several EU enforcements against Google. However there were some later additions, by co-legislators in the Parliament and Council, such as messaging interoperability (which caught many by surprise), as well as limits on tracking ads. Some similar types of conditions have already been enforced on some tech giants in certain EU markets, using existing competition powers. Such as the Netherlands — which last year forced Apple to allow developers of dating apps to choose to use alternative payment systems. While Germany has been ahead of the ex ante curve domestically, after it updated its own competition regime back at the start of 2021 — and already has some enforcements on a number of tech giants it has designated as having “paramount significance” for competition locally (such as Google). Enforcement of EU data protection law is also finally cutting into Meta’s ability to force behavioral ads on users. So we’ve had a taster of bigger things to come when the DMA is firing on all cylinders. The big change here is that the conditions apply up-front — so the idea is to proactively regulate digital giants that have the power to set rules on others that need to access their core platform services and force them to be supportive of competition and sensitive to consumer needs (rather than just favoring themselves); instead of antitrust regulators having to spend years investigating and amassing evidence of abuses to make cases against bad behavior before it can be stopped, typically long after the harm has been entrenched, as has been the case in most of Europe under classical (ex post) competition rules. That said, the pan-EU regulation will take some time to spin up. And there are continuing concerns about resourcing and how prepared the Commission is to screw its courage to the sticking place and take on such a hefty oversight role leaning on some of the most powerful platforms in the world. Time will tell how much pushback the DMA gets from tech giants accustomed to (mostly) operating how they like and/or lobbying like the damned when lawmakers suggest making changes that might get in the way of their money-minting machines. It also remains to be seen how willing the Commission is to stick to its guns and robustly enforce a new digital world order (especially as looming EU elections will reconfigure the bloc’s political power structures next year, including by bringing in new leaders who may not be as committed to the approach as those that drafted the DMA). We for sure won’t seen any enforcements on gatekeepers until next Spring — since those designated in September will have six months to get their house in order. But we may see some operational changes in preparation for the new rules. And possibly whole new business models emerging down the line as, for example, consentless ad tracking becomes less and less viable for major social media giants. Lots of legal action to test the boundaries and mettle of the DMA also looks inevitable. So the next few years in Europe are set to be filled with interesting new power struggles. Over in the U.K., which left the bloc following the Brexit referendum vote, the government also recently signalled it will move forward with an ex ante reboot of its own to tackle anti-competitive tech giants. The approach being suggested there is for bespoke (tailored) conditions, per platform, on those with “strategic market significance”, rather than fixed obligations for all in-scope giants.    "
299,Lockheed doubles down on lunar economy bet with new subsidiary Crescent Space Services,['@breadfrom'],"March 28, 2023","Lockheed Martin announced today the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary called Crescent Space Services that will focus on infrastructure for the moon, the latest sign that the aerospace and defense giant is bullish on the future of a lunar economy. The new venture will focus initially on a communications and navigation network in cislunar orbit it’s calling Parsec. The Parsec network will be owned and operated by Crescent, with Lockheed designing and building the spacecraft. The first satellite is anticipated to launch in 2025, timed to arrive in cislunar orbit prior to NASA’s third Artemis mission, which will land humans on the moon. Lockheed installed Joe Landon as the company’s new CEO. Landon previously served as Lockheed Martin Space’s VP of advanced programs development, where he led strategy and business development for the company’s commercial space projects. Prior to that, he served as CFO of asteroid mining venture Planetary Resources. Crescent was born out of a shifting demand from customers, Landon explained to TechCrunch. Over the past decade, customers — primarily NASA — started to shift from buying objects, like spacecraft, to buying capabilities. “That created a new opportunity for Lockheed where we needed to adapt,” he said. “Lockheed Martin traditionally is a technology developer and manufacturer of really great systems. But what we needed and what the market is really demanding is a service.” While Crescent is starting with the Parsec network, the company intends to eventually expand into providing other infrastructure services, like power and mobility. These services will likely benefit from Lockheed’s existing programs, like its autonomous moon rover in development with General Motors, and its initiatives on in-space solar systems. Interest in a lunar economy has skyrocketed in the past few years. NASA has been a major driver of this interest, handing out major contracts to companies like SpaceX, Astrobotic and others for services spanning launch to payload delivery on the lunar surface. But if government initiatives are leading the charge, the private markets are not far behind: In a report published last year, McKinsey & Co. found that the share of private investment into the space economy that’s focused on “lunar and beyond” initiatives has steadily risen, accounting for 10-15% of overall private investment into space-related companies. Crescent is trying to get out ahead of this burgeoning market, Landon said. Once all the elements of infrastructure are in place, the company may even think of in-space services beyond lunar orbit. “Once we’re set up on the moon, we can go beyond the moon,” he said. “If the market goes to need communications around Mars, for instance, we’d be really set up to provide that as well.”"
300,Hacked verified Facebook pages impersonating Meta are buying ads from Meta,['@tayhatmaker'],"May 5, 2023","Sketchy Facebook pages impersonating businesses are nothing new, but a flurry of recent scams is particularly brazen. A handful of verified Facebook pages were hacked recently and spotted slinging likely malware through ads approved by and purchased through the platform. But the accounts should be easy to catch — in some cases, they were impersonating Facebook itself. Social consultant Matt Navarra first spotted some of the ads, sharing them on Twitter. The compromised accounts include official-sounding pages like “Meta Ads” and “Meta Ads Manager.” Those accounts shared suspicious links to tens of thousands of followers, though their reach probably extended well beyond that through paid posts.  In another instance, a hacked verified account purporting to be “Google AI” pointed users toward fake links for Bard, Google’s AI chatbot. That account previously belonged to Indian singer and actress Miss Pooja before the account name was changed on April 29. That account, which operated for at least a decade, boasted more than 7 million followers.  Facebook now tracks and publicly displays a history of name changes for verified accounts — a welcome bit of transparency but a safeguard that apparently isn’t enough to flag some obvious scams. What’s most egregious in these cases is that the hacked pages were not only impersonating major tech companies, including Meta itself, but that they were able to purchase Facebooks ads and go on to distribute suspicious download links. In spite of very recent account name changes, those ads were apparently approved without issue in Meta’s automated ads system. All of the impersonator pages Navarra identified have since been disabled. This week, Meta shared a report on a recent spate of AI-themed malware scams. In those instances, hackers lure Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users to download malware by posing as popular AI chatbot tools like ChatGPT. One of those clusters of malware known as DuckTail has been plaguing businesses on Facebook for a few years now. As TechCrunch’s Carly Page explained this week: Meta says that attackers distributing the DuckTail malware have increasingly turned to these AI-themed lures in an attempt to compromise businesses with access to Facebook ad accounts. DuckTail, which has targeted Facebook users since 2021, steals browser cookies and hijacks logged-in Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim’s Facebook account, including account information, location data and two-factor authentication codes. The malware also allows the threat actor to hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has access to. It’s possible that the Facebook pages that impersonated Facebook and went on to buy malware-laden ads were compromised through DuckTail or malware like it. “We invest significant resources into detecting and preventing scams and hacks,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “While many of the improvements we’ve made are difficult to see – because they minimize people from having issues in the first place – scammers are always trying to get around our security measures.” Impersonator accounts and compromised business pages have long been a headache for business owners across Facebook and Instagram. Meta Verified, the company’s newly launched verification program, is positioned to improve the company’s notoriously thin level of customer support for businesses that rely on its apps. Controversially, Meta’s promising offer of “proactive account protection” isn’t a free improvement — Instagram and Facebook accounts will need to pay $14.99 a month to secure the higher level of customer support, a price many businesses will likely begrudgingly pay to avoid drowning in a sea of scam accounts.

301,Nvidia releases a toolkit to make text-generating AI ‘safer’,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 25, 2023","For all the fanfare, text-generating AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 make a lot of mistakes — some of them harmful. The Verge’s James Vincent once called one such model an “emotionally manipulative liar,” which pretty much sums up the current state of things. The companies behind these models say that they’re taking steps to fix the problems, like implementing filters and teams of human moderators to correct issues as they’re flagged. But there’s no one right solution. Even the best models today are susceptible to biases, toxicity and malicious attacks.  In pursuit of “safer” text-generating models, Nvidia today released NeMo Guardrails, an open source toolkit aimed at making AI-powered apps more “accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure.” Jonathan Cohen, the VP of applied research at Nvidia, says the company has been working on Guardrails’ underlying system for “many years” but just about a year ago realized it was a good fit for models along the lines of GPT-4 and ChatGPT. “We’ve been developing toward this release of NeMo Guardrails ever since,” Cohen told TechCrunch via email. “AI model safety tools are critical to deploying models for enterprise use cases.” Guardrails includes code, examples and documentation to “add safety” to AI apps that generate text as well as speech. Nvidia claims that the toolkit is designed to work with most generative language models, allowing developers to create rules using a few lines of code. Specifically, Guardrails can be used to prevent — or at least attempt to prevent — models from veering off topic, responding with inaccurate information or toxic language and making connections to “unsafe” external sources. Think keeping a customer service assistant from answering questions about the weather, for instance, or a search engine chatbot from linking to disreputable academic journals. “Ultimately, developers control what is out of bounds for their application with Guardrails,” Cohen said. “They may develop guardrails that are too broad or, conversely, too narrow for their use case.” A universal fix for language models’ shortcomings sounds too good to be true, though — and indeed, it is. While companies like Zapier are using Guardrails to add a layer of safety to their generative models, Nvidia acknowledges that the toolkit isn’t imperfect; it won’t catch everything, in other words. Cohen also notes that Guardrails works best with models that are “sufficiently good at instruction-following,” à la ChatGPT, and that use the popular LangChain framework for building AI-powered apps. That disqualifies some of the open source options out there. And — effectiveness of the tech aside — it must be emphasized that Nvidia isn’t necessarily releasing Guardrails out of the goodness of its heart. It’s a part of the company’s NeMo framework, which is available through Nvidia’s enterprise AI software suite and its NeMo fully managed cloud service. Any company can implement the open source release of Guardrails, but Nvidia would surely prefer that they pay for the hosted version instead. So while there’s probably no harm in Guardrails, keep in mind that it’s not a silver bullet — and be wary if Nvidia ever claims otherwise."
302,Irrigreen’s precision sprinklers prevent water waste and wet legs,['@harriblogs'],"March 29, 2023","Investors just pumped millions into Irrigreen, a startup vying to quench America’s thirsty lawns with “approximately 50% less water.” Seed investor Ulu led the $15 million funding round. Two tech investors that are focused on water conservation — Burnt Island and Echo River — also chipped in, among a handful of others. The San Francisco–based sprinkler startup says it maps lawns to drizzle water precisely where lawn-havers want it, without clumsily soaking walkways and passersby. Irrigreen’s system tasks users with tracing the contours of their yard, and identifying obstacles, such as footpaths and driveways. The tech sounds somewhat like Roomba’s Keep-Out Zones, yet these sprinklers are stationary; instead of wandering the lawn, the startup says its sprinkler heads adjust the stream to send water where you want it. Image Credit: Irrigreen Image Credit: Irrigreen Americans are thirsty mfs: The typical family uses around 320 gallons per day, “about 30 percent of which is devoted to outdoor uses,” the EPA says. Water is already scarce, and droughts exacerbated by climate change make water conservation all the more critical. There are lots of ways to conserve water, and outdoor options include planting native ground cover and installing custom irrigation systems. In other words, internet-connected sprinklers like Irrigreen’s are not the only way to save water. Still, founder Shane Dyer tells TechCrunch that the startup’s system is cheaper than traditional options “for larger yards (those with 7 or more zones).” Dyer added, “Our hardware costs more, but the labor to install is 1/3 of a traditional system since there is 80% less heads and trenching and piping.” Regardless, if tech is what gets you jazzed about saving water, then by all means give it a go. TechCrunch has not tested Irrigreen’s sprinklers. The startup pointed us to a Fresno State study it commissioned, which found that its sprinkler heads used around 40% less water by avoiding “overwatering, overspray, and application rate inaccuracy.” Dyer told TechCrunch that Irrigreen also factors in weather, soil, plant types, and shade to “calculate the minimum water needed for healthy plants.” The startup says these additional factors deliver around 50% water and cost savings in all. Dyer declined to share Irrigreen’s valuation but said the new cash will go toward “developing next generation sprinkler software, creating next generation cloud watering intelligence, and smartphone app control and reporting features.” Among the coming software updates, Dyer said Irrigreen will be able to adjust the amount of water it sends to different sections of plants via a single sprinkler head. This could come in handy if, for example, you plopped some thirsty flowers beside some drought-tolerant shrubs.  "
303,Microsoft makes its AI-powered Designer tool available in preview,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 27, 2023","Today, Microsoft Designer, Microsoft’s AI-powered design tool, launched in public preview with an expanded set of features. Announced in October, Designer is a Canva-like web app that can generate designs for presentations, posters, digital postcards, invitations, graphics and more to share on social media and other channels. It leverages user-created content and DALL-E 2, OpenAI’s text-to-image AI, to ideate designs, with drop-downs and text boxes for further customization and personalization. “Since October, the AI models have steadily improved, and we’ve worked to weave these powerful capabilities throughout the Designer canvas in even more delightful ways while keeping you in control,” Bryan Rognier, GM at Microsoft’s 365 Consumer division, wrote in a blog post published today. Now Designer can generate written captions and hashtags relevant for social media posts, offering several suggestions users can choose from. It can also create animated visuals, complete with backgrounds and text transitions, powered by AI. New features coming to Microsoft’s AI-powered Designer tool. Image Credits: Microsoft New features coming to Microsoft’s AI-powered Designer tool. Image Credits: Microsoft In the future, Designer will gain additional editing features, Microsoft says, including the ability to place an object in a specific spot in a graphic and automatically fill in the rest of a picture. Forthcoming “erase” and “replace background” options, meanwhile, will let users brush over objects, people or backdrops they didn’t intend to be in a graphic. Designer will remain free during the preview period, Microsoft says — it’s available via the Designer website and in Microsoft’s Edge browser through the sidebar. Once the Designer app is generally available, it’ll be included in Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions and have “some” functionality free to use for non-subscribers, though Microsoft didn’t elaborate. Addressing some of the legal questions that’ve sprung up recently around AI-powered image-generation systems, Microsoft says that users will have “full” usage rights to commercialize the images they create with Designer and Image Creator. It’s unclear whether that might change in the future, though, given the ongoing court battles involving OpenAI and other startups commercializing generative AI tools."
304,India’s Meesho cuts 251 jobs to ‘accelerate timeline to profitability’,['@refsrc'],"May 5, 2023","Meesho cut 15% of its workforce, or 251 roles, on Friday as the Indian social commerce startup pares its expenses to improve its financial health and confront the “economic reality.” This is the second round of job cuts at Meesho, which eliminated about 150 roles a year ago. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup — backed by Fidelity, Prosus, SoftBank, Sequoia India and Meta — said in a statement that it is looking to “work with a leaner organizational structure to achieve sustained profitability.” “We are committed to ensuring all those impacted have our full support and will be provided a separation package that includes a one-time severance payment of 2.5 to 9 months (depending on tenor and designation), continued insurance benefits, job placement support and accelerated vesting of ESOPs. We remain grateful for their contributions in building Meesho,” a Meesho spokesperson said in a statement. The job cuts follows Meesho aggressively trimming its cash burn in the last year. The startup is “nearing zero cash burn” and is targeting to achieve EBIDTA breakeven in 2023, its leadership team recently told brokerage firm Jefferies. “We grew by 10X from 2020 to 2022, helped by Covid tailwinds and aggressive investments. Even as we tracked to our plans, the macro climate undeniably and considerably changed. As a result, we have had to accelerate our timeline to profitability as part of Project Redbull, while readjusting our GMV growth goals to 30% YoY. While our cash reserves buffer us well for these harsh circumstances, we need to stay highly prudent on the cost front,” Meesho co-founder and chief executive Vidit Aatrey told employees in an email seen by TechCrunch. He added: “As leaders, we made judgement errors in over-hiring ahead of the curve. At the same time, we could have run our org structure in a more effective and lean manner overall. Our spans and layers were inflated, and this could have unintended consequences on our speed to execute. While we are confident that Meesho business will stay strong, the economic reality is here to stay. We are now faced with the hard truth of aligning our people costs with the new projections for our business.” The seven-year-old e-commerce startup, whose sellers are predominantly based in smaller cities, drove a GMV of $4.5 billion in 2022, a nine-fold growth over a year, the startup told Jefferies. Meesho is attempting to serve an audience that is too sensitive to price and don’t mind unbranded products. This value proposition has “resonated well with the low to mid income customer cohorts from tier 2+ markets, forming the bulk of the consuming class in India although there is traction seen in metro/tier-1 as well,” Jefferies wrote. Compared to traditional platforms, where the average order value by a customer is about 1,000 Indian rupees, or $12.2, Meesho’s AOV stands below 350 Indian rupees, according to Jefferies and people familiar with the matter. This small basket size presents unique challenges and opportunities and unlocking it is key to expanding the e-commerce market in India, analysts say."
305,Alcohol recovery startups Monument and Tempest shared patients’ private data with advertisers,['@zackwhittaker'],"April 4, 2023","For years, online alcohol recovery startups Monument and Tempest were sharing with advertisers the personal information and health data of their patients without their consent. Monument, which acquired Tempest in 2022, confirmed the extensive years-long leak of patients’ information in a data breach notification filed with California’s attorney general last week, blaming their use of third-party tracking systems developed by ad giants including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Pinterest. When reached for comment, Monument CEO Mike Russell confirmed more than 100,000 patients are affected. In its disclosure, the companies confirmed their use of website trackers, which are small snippets of code that share with tech giants information about visitors to their websites, and often used for analytics and advertising. The data shared with advertisers includes patient names, dates of birth, email and postal addresses, phone numbers and membership numbers associated with the companies and patients’ insurance provider. The data also included the person’s photo, unique digital ID, which services or plan the patient is using, appointment information and assessment and survey responses submitted by the patient, which includes detailed responses about a person’s alcohol consumption and used to determine their course of treatment. Monument’s own website says these survey answers are “protected” and “used only” by its care team. Monument confirmed that it shared patients’ sensitive data with advertisers since January 2020, and Tempest since November 2017. Both companies say they have removed the tracking code from their websites. But the tech giants are not obligated to delete the data that Monument and Tempest shared with them. Monument and Tempest are the latest healthcare companies to disclose the inadvertent sharing of patient data with third-parties by way of tracking technologies. Last month, online mental health startup Cerebral confirmed it had exposed the personal and health information of more than 3 million patients who signed up to its services because of a similar years-long leak of data to third-party advertisers.

306,Classified intel leaked to Discord server leads to 21-year-old’s arrest,['@tayhatmaker'],"April 13, 2023","Law enforcement officials arrested a 21-year-old on Thursday after tracing a trove of classified secrets that found their way to the public through the chat app Discord. The suspect, U.S. Air Force National Guard member Jack Teixeira, was identified by The New York Times prior to his arrest. Teixeira reportedly led a private Discord group where a small group of men posted memes and discussed shared interests, including gaming, racist jokes and guns. “Today the Justice Department arrested Jack Douglas Teixeira in connection with an investigation into alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information,” Attorney General Merrick Garland confirmed in a press conference on Thursday afternoon. Teixeira will have his first appearance in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. According to The Washington Post, the classified documents originated in a small Discord server known as “Thug Shaker Central,” a meme reference. By February, a member of that Discord group started sharing the material in a broader Discord server called “wow_mao.” A month later they showed up in a Minecraft channel with thousands of members. Thursday’s arrest came relatively swiftly. But the cache of intelligence documents, which included many previously secret, sensitive details about the war in Ukraine, had been circulating online for months prior to the U.S. catching on. That fact has raised alarm within the federal government, which could expand the scope of social media services that it monitors in response. This story is developing…"
307,Ambani bats for cricket glory as Disney scales back in India,['@refsrc'],"March 31, 2023","Mukesh Ambani’s Jio, the South Asian telecom powerhouse, has long sought to entice its customer base with a plethora of services aimed at boosting subscriber retention. Despite amassing over 425 million customers and claiming the mantle of India’s top network provider—due in large part to its aggressively competitive data pricing—Jio’s array of additional services has yet to gain significant traction. With the highly anticipated Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament starting later today, Ambani is eyeing this as the perfect opportunity to revamp Jio’s service adoption strategy even as the firm recognizes that cricket streaming will not turn a profit for several years. Viacom18 – a venture between Ambani’s Reliance and Paramount – outbid Disney to secure five years of IPL’s streaming rights for the Indian subcontinent region with a sum of $3 billion. Unlike Disney’s Hotstar, which restricted access to IPL streaming to paid subscribers in recent seasons, Viacom18 is opening the floodgates for IPL games to everyone on the Jio network. In a move that proved transformative, Star India executives Ajit Mohan and Uday Shankar’s strategic investment in cricket streaming nearly a decade ago catapulted Hotstar to prominence as a household name. The platform drew over 100 million digital viewers during the two-month-long event year after year, with cricket alone solidifying Hotstar’s position at the pinnacle of the market. Star India’s Hotstar became a crown jewel in Fox’s large portfolio in the $71 billion acquisition by Disney, prompting the Mickey Mouse company to expand the service to many international markets. However, Disney’s decision last year to relinquish digital streaming bids in favor of securing television broadcast rights under the leadership of former CEO Bob Chapek left many industry insiders perplexed. The company has also decided not to renew the licensing rights for HBO content in India in a move that has understandably frustrated many Hotstar subscribers. Hotstar, which has about 50 million subscribers, is estimated to lose 15 million this year, according to estimates by several analyst groups. Mohan left Star to lead Facebook’s India business in 2019 and has since moved to Snap, where he serves as the president of the firm’s Asia Pacific business. Shankar, who also left Star, has formed a venture fund with former top Fox executive James Murdoch. The duo, who earlier backed media-focused startups through their fund Lupa, invested $1.78 billion in Viacom18 last year. In 2016, as Reliance prepared to launch Jio, the company emerged as the first telecom operator to believe in Hotstar’s vision and commit to collaboration, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Disney reaped significant benefits from Jio’s competitively priced data plans, which enabled tens of millions of Indian consumers to alter their internet consumption habits virtually overnight. Now, it appears that Reliance, whose marquee business is oil refining, is shifting gears. Jio has been assertively recruiting talent from Disney’s Hotstar, restructuring its infrastructure to accommodate a large user base. The company plans to provide 16 distinct feeds for IPL matches, featuring ultra-HD resolution — a first for cricket in India — and coverage in 12 languages. Analyst group Media Partners Asia estimates that Jio Cinema, where Viacom18 plans to stream matches, will be able to drive sales of up to $350 million during the IPL season this year, up from $128 million in digital sales in 2022. The group marked down advertising sales on pay TV to $220 million, from $442 million last year. “The US$550 mil. number across digital and pay-TV is marginally flat Y/Y and represents a steep loss against annualized 2023-27 IPL rights fees of US$1.2 bil. Subscription fees are expected to be very modest this year because of challenges on pay-TV distribution and the lack of a subscription fee on digital,” it wrote in a report. Reliance has “promised” advertisers that cricket streaming on Jio Cinema will reach 400 million users, said Media Partners Asia. Jio Cinema has also promised a concurrent user base of 100 million, nearly four times of the current records, the analyst group added. Nonetheless, this underscores a considerable leap for Jio Cinema, which currently boasts fewer than 30 million monthly active users, as per data from mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This is despite the fact that over 400 million Jio subscribers are eligible to access Jio Cinema at no extra charge. Numerous industry executives have expressed skepticism regarding the likelihood of such a significant number of users transitioning to streaming on their smartphones when they have the option of watching games on their satellite televisions. Additionally, whether Jio Cinema can effectively manage the technical demands of tens of millions of viewers tuning in to cricket matches remains an open question for the time being."
308,Cortical Labs raises $10M for its Pong-playing stem cells that eventually could power AI,['@mikebutcher'],"April 19, 2023","While generative AI is buzzy right now, what OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are doing may be only part of the story. There is also the process of using biology: the idea of using stem cells to create biocomputers that could potentially be smarter and more energy efficient than what we are used to today. Australian startup Cortical Labs popped up on the radar after Amazon CTO Werner Vogels flew down to Australia to visit their lab recently, and he even wrote about it, calling it “intriguing.” Cortical combines synthetic biology and human neurons to develop what it claims is a class of AI, known as “Organoid Intelligence” (OI). It’s now raised a $10 million funding round led by Horizons Ventures, with participation from LifeX (Life Extension) Ventures (the launch of which which we covered last year), Blackbird Ventures, Radar Ventures and In-Q-Tel (the venture arm of the CIA). The company says it is already in the process of fulfilling orders for its technology. How it works is that it uses clusters of lab-cultivated neurons from human stem cells to form what it calls a “DishBrain,” which is then hooked-up to hard silicon to create what it describes as a Biological Intelligence Operating System (biOS). Some observers say this is the future of AI because human neurons could be better than any digital AI model for generalized intelligence, given that they are self-programming and require far less energy consumption. Hon Weng Chong, CEO and founder of Cortical Labs, said in a statement: “The possibilities that a hybridised AI meets synthetic biology model can unlock are limitless, accelerating the possibilities of digital AI in a more powerful and more sustainable way.”   Jonathan Tam of Horizons Ventures said: “Ultimately, by being able to use these systems to better understand, and eventually harness, how neurons display intelligence, it will open up a plethora of applications, including a revolution in personalized medicine and disease detection.” Cortical Labs’ technology first appeared in the scientific journal Neuron in October 2022, demonstrating that neurons in a petri dish can be encouraged to play the computer game Pong. This sounds trivial, but as Weng Chong told me over email, this could allow the development and testing of new drugs and therapies, plus “if you took your blood and made them into neurons then this drug discovery becomes even more personalizable – the results would be tailored specifically for you only.” He also says that competition in the space is low: “It doesn’t directly compete with anything because this is the first of its kind pioneering the field of Organoid Intelligence. Organoid Intelligence has the potential to learn faster and use far less energy than any other AI system in existence. GPT is so smart because it ingested all of the Internet, however you or I don’t have to for us to have pretty good conversational skills.” “It took at least 10 years since Geoff Hinton and Alex Krizhevsky put a GPU to do Deep Learning that we’ve gotten to where we are today. We’re still in the early days of this technology,” he added. In the immediate term, he says an immediate application is to effectively drip a new drug onto the cells to test it — if the cells can no longer play Pong, you know the drug doesn’t work: “Not only is the efficacy able to be better determined but also the cognitive side-effects (brain fog) can be elucidated as we now have a potential assay for cognition in the form of neurons playing the Pong game.” He says the technology could also be used to study dementia and even “brute force” test the compounds that we have discovered using Quantum Computing and Generative AI.” And potentially further into the future “if the number and complexity of these neurons are scaled, the end result would be familiar to us as fully embodied organisms such as a cat, dog, or human.” Hold on to your hats, people."

310,Lordstown Motors’ Endurance EV pickup truck is dying,['@kirstenkorosec'],"May 4, 2023","Beleaguered EV company Lordstown Motors seemed to have found a financial savior in Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer best known for making iPhones for Apple. But now, with that relationship faltering, it appears the road is ending for Lordstown’s Endurance EV truck and maybe even the company. Lordstown issued a warning May 1 that it could be forced to file for bankruptcy because Foxconn may pull out of a critical funding deal. On Thursday, the company said in its first-quarter earnings report that “it anticipates production of the Endurance will cease in the near future” after repeated production delays, failing to find a strategic partner for the truck and extremely limited ability to raise capital in the current market environment. Lordstown Motors had just $108 million in cash at the end of the first quarter, according to its earnings report. Shares of Lordstown Motors, which hit an all-time low of $0.25 earlier this week, were trading up at $0.39 by midday. The company, along with manufacturing partner Foxconn, started commercial production of the Endurance in the third quarter of 2022. The first three vehicles were delivered toward the end of the year. Manufacturing slowdowns, coupled with quality issues discovered in the truck, which also prompted a voluntary recall, made the company pause production and customer deliveries until mid-April 2023. The situation became dire after Foxconn sent a letter on April 21 to Lordstown stating the automaker was in breach of the investment agreement because its stock price fell below $1 for 30 days and was at risk of being delisted on the Nasdaq exchange. Foxconn warned it would terminate the investment agreement if the breach was not resolved within 30 days. Lordstown has had a tumultuous run since its founding in 2019. The startup, an offshoot of another struggling EV company Workhorse Group, reached a deal in 2020 to merge with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion. There was considerable attention and hype around the company, particularly in 2020 when it revealed a prototype of its Endurance EV truck. The company’s founder, Steve Burns, who has since been ousted, was bullish about demand for the truck. He claimed at the time that the company had received 20,000 preorders for the truck, essentially its entire planned production capacity for the year. The company had planned to produce 20,000 electric commercial trucks annually, starting in 2021, at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio. That date came and went as a string of internal scandals, an SEC investigation and financial struggles hobbled the company. In January 2021, the company’s leadership claimed the preorders and jumped to 100,000 vehicles. Two months later, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had taken a short position on Lordstown Motors. Hindenburg said, at the time, that its short position was based on a company that has “no revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.” Hindenburg also said that “extensive research reveals that the company’s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.” Just two months later, Lordstown halved production volumes of the Endurance — from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 — due to a lack of funding. Lordstown execs dug themselves into a deeper hole by attempting to calm investors a day after its CEO and CTO resigned with statements that they had binding orders from customers that would fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. The company retracted those statements within days. The situation became more dire when the Department of Justice and the SEC launched separate investigations into the company."
311,Twilio Segment introduces new portable customer records with reverse ETL,['@ron_miller'],"March 29, 2023","Gathering customer information in a CDP is about understanding your customers better and delivering more tailored experiences, but getting that information where it needs to be to make that happen has proven challenging. Perhaps Twilio Segment, the CDP Twilio bought in 2020 for $3.2 billion, can help with some new features designed to make it easier to make use of that data by making it more portable and introducing reverse ETL (extract, transform, load) to get the data where it needs to be. The company is calling this new approach Segment Unify, which Kevin Niparko, VP of Twilio Segment, says involves building these customer records from myriad data sources, the ability to store that record in the data warehouse of choice and, finally, using reverse ETL to move the data to wherever it’s needed. “We’re launching Segment Unify, which is really the next generation of our customer data platform. There are sort of two marquee features here. The first is around identity resolution and profiles. So this is helping build that golden customer record across all of the digital signals,” Niparko told TechCrunch. “We then provide portability around that with profile sync so we can load that directly into a data warehouse like Snowflake, BigQuery or Redshift, where data scientists and data engineers can incorporate that into their models and analytics and business intelligence. We’re also providing reverse ETL capabilities, which you can think of as a syncing back out of the data warehouse into all of the tools in that marketing and analytics stack, regardless of the vendor,” he said. Niparko says that this flexibility without vendor lock-in is a big differentiator for his platform. “This gives data scientists and analysts the ability to take the insights that they’re uncovering in the data warehouse, and then sync them into a marketing automation tool, like Customer.io, sync that into other tools like Amplitude or Mixpanel to help the entire organization leverage that same singular insight around the golden customer profile,” he said. He says this can enable customers to get closer to the idea of true personalization. “Ultimately, we do see the world moving towards a one-to-one engagement model. I think that’s going to require, one, that this foundation be in place with portable customer records, and then layering in AI that can reason about all of these different signals and then deliver that singular message that’s right for that customer at that stage of their journey.” While the company is officially announcing the product today, it has customers like CrossFit, MongoDB and Sanofi working with it already."

313,"‘High conviction, low volume’: Playfair launches $70M pre-seed fund for European startups",['@psawers'],"March 28, 2023","Early-stage investments inherently have a higher risk of failing, but these risks also come with potentially higher rewards: getting in at the ground floor of a startup’s journey gives VCs more negotiation clout. This is particularly true at the very early pre-seed stage, where companies might barely have a functioning product to shout about. And this is something that London-based generalist VC firm Playfair Capital knows all about, given its focus on backing super young startups that have yet to make much of a ripple in their respective industries. In its 10-year history, Playfair has invested in around 100 companies, including well-established unicorns such as Stripe and Mapillary, a startup that exited to Facebook back in 2020. Those investments were from Playfair’s inaugural fund, which wasn’t focused on any particular “stage” of company. But Playfair transitioned into more of a pre-seed firm with its second fund, announced in 2019, a focus that it’s maintaining for its new £57 million ($70 million) third fund, which it announced today. While many early-stage VC funds might look to make a few dozen investments annually, Playfair has kept things fairly trim throughout its history, committing to no more than eight investments each year while ringfencing some of its capital for a handful of follow-on investments. Its latest fund comes amid a swathe of fresh early-stage European VC funds, including Emblem, which announced a new $80 million seed fund last week, while and-based Ovni Capital, which emerged on the scene last month with a $54 million early-stage fund. Playfair seeks out founders “outside of dominant tech hubs” as well as founders working on projects that may be more tangential to where the main hype and “buzzy-ness” exists. This is perhaps even more integral if its stated goal is to only invest in a handful of startups each year: they don’t have the luxury of spreading a lot of money around to increase their chances of finding a winner. “High conviction, low volume” is Playfair’s stated ethos here, and identifying true differentiators is a major part of this. “I’d say probably half the funding in our portfolio is pre-product, pre-traction,” Playfair managing partner Chris Smith explained to TechCrunch. “And the other half have some sort of really early traction, maybe a MVP (minimal viable product) or a couple of POCs (proof-of-concepts). But we tend to invest where there’s very little in the way of traction.” It wasn’t that long ago when autonomous automobile technology was all the rage, dominating just about every trade show and tech conference. And there was one specific event several years back, the EcoMotion mobility event in Israel, that Smith says really helps to highlight its investment ethos. “I went in to look at the roughly 120 companies exhibiting; about 116 of the companies were doing autonomy for cars,” Smith said. “And as an investor, I look at this and think that if you’re writing tons of checks a year, you probably just invest in lots of them and try and find a winner. But we don’t; we only do six to eight [annual investments]. So my view was, ‘I don’t want to play in that space.’ The only real distinction between them was whether they were choosing LIDAR or computer vision. There just wasn’t enough differentiation.” However, at this same conference, there were four companies doing something completely different. One of them was Orca AI, which was developing a collision-avoidance system for ships, and it was this company from a sea of samey startups that Playfair ended up investing in — both for the company’s 2019 pre-seed funding round and its follow-on Series A round two years later. “That’s where we like to look,” Smith said. “We like these nascent markets: I call them ‘overlooked and unsexy sectors.’ That’s where we really like to get stuck in, and where I see the opportunity.” A large chunk of early-stage deals fall apart in the due diligence phase. But if a company doesn’t have any market traction or even a fully-working product yet, how exactly do VCs go about deciding who’s worth a bet? While one of the oldest investment cliches says something about the importance of ‘investing in people rather than companies,’ that is perhaps even more true at the super early stage. And while having previous exits and success in the business world can be a useful indicator, there are many things that can ultimately determine whether a founder or founding team are intrinsically investable. “We look for a few things, including examples of exceptional performance,” Smith said. “And I think the key thing is that it doesn’t necessarily have to be in the business world, or even in the domain they’re building the company.” Playfair capital staff portraits Image Credits: Playfair Capital Playfair capital staff portraits Image Credits: Playfair Capital By way of example, Playfair recently re-invested in AeroCloud, a four-year-old SaaS startup from the Northwest of England that’s building airport management software, having also invested in its seed round some two years previous. AeroCloud co-founder and CEO George Richardson had been a fairly successful professional racing driver since the age of 15, but he didn’t really have any direct experience in the aviation sector before setting up AeroCloud. “He didn’t know anything about airports before he started the company,” Smith said. “But we thought, if someone can podium at Le Mans and exist under such enormous pressure, that’s an amazing character trait path for a founder.” Obviously, there are many other factors that go into the due diligence process, including meticulous industry research to establish the scale of the problem the startup proclaims to be solving. But some sort of successful track record, in just about anything, is a useful barometer at the early investment stage. “If you can play a musical instrument to an incredible level, or [if you’re] a professional racing driver, or golfer or whatever it is — I do think that is quite a useful predictor of future performance,” Smith said. “But it’s [investing due diligence] a combination of spending plenty of time with the founders and getting to understand what makes them tick. Then going really deep to support the thesis.” A lot has happened in the world between 2019 and 2023, with a global pandemic and major economic downturn intersecting Playfair’s second and third funds. In the broader sphere of Big Tech, startups and venture capital, we’ve seen major redundancies, plunging valuations and delayed IPOs, but in the early-stage world Playfair inhabits, it’s been a slightly different experience. “At pre-seed, where we invest, we’re quite insulated from what’s happening in the IPO markets or what’s happening with growth funds,” Smith said. That’s not to say nothing has changed, though. Its third fund is more than double the size of its second fund, which reflects the size of checks it’s now having to write for companies — rising from an average of around of perhaps £500,000 previously to around £750,000 today, though that figure may creep up toward the £1 million mark. So what has driven that change? A combination of factors, as you might expect, including the simple fact that there is more capital around and the economic conditions that everyone is currently facing. “In 2021, there was this crazy peak. Now it’s settled again, but rounds are still significantly higher than they were in 2018-2019,” Smith said. “We’re actually really fortunate in the U.K. to have the SEIS and EIS schemes (tax-efficient schemes for investors), because they brought in a ton of angel capital, and also capital from funds that take advantage of the tax breaks — there’s basically just more money around. I actually think inflation has played a part, too. So whilst in some senses the cost of building a startup has fallen, such as access to certain tools, at the same time, salaries have gone up a lot. So, startup founders back in 2018-2019 might have paid themselves £30,000-40,000 [annually]. You see founders now being paid maybe £60,000-70,000. So founders need more to be able to live comfortably while they build their company.” This, of course, follows through to the hiring and building of teams, who will also now be expecting more money to counter the cost-of-living increases across society. Throw into the mix, perhaps, the growing understanding that a fledgling company might need a little more runway to stand a chance of succeeding, and all this might go some way toward explaining growing check-sizes in the early seed stages. “I think that Europe has maybe learned a few lessons from the U.S., which is that there’s no point in putting really small amounts of money into companies, giving them really short runways, putting unnecessary pressure on them and then watching them fail,” Smith said. “You want to give companies enough money so that they’ve got 18 to 24 months, time to pivot, time to figure stuff out. That increases the chances of success.” While not unique in the early-stage investment fray, Playfair has a sole limited partner (LP) in the form of founder Federico Pirzio-Biroli who provides all the capital, and who ran it initially as both a managing partner and LP. Smith stepped in for Federico for the second fund, and Federico has since moved to Kenya, where he now has a more passive role in terms of day-to-day involvement. And, having just one person providing the capital simplifies things greatly. “It gives us a ton of advantages: it means I don’t spend 40%-50% of my time fundraising, and I can spend my time working with our founders,” Smith said. “I think it’s also just a huge vote of confidence.” This “vote of confidence,” according to Smith, stems from Playfair having already returned the entirety of its first fund in cash, helped in part by several exits. This number will likely receive a major boost, too, with Stripe gearing up for a bumper IPO — Playfair invested in the fintech giant at its Series C round in 2014 before it narrowed its focus to pre-seed. For its second fund, Smith said they’ve reached somewhere in the region of 95th percentile for TVPI (total value vs paid in capital). According to Dealroom data, some 19% of seed-stage companies raise a Series A within 36 months. By contrast, Playfair says that 75% of its Fund 2 investments have now also raised a Series A investment, and in 2022 alone, its portfolio companies secured $570 million in follow-on funding from various VCs. “Success for our founders is basically the same as success for us, which is getting them from pre-seed to a successful Series A round,” Smith said. And while Playfair does typically pass the lead-investor baton on to another VC firm for subsequent rounds, it will often lead again on the seed round as well as participating in Series A rounds and very occasionally, later. In part, this is as much about displaying confidence as it is providing capital, which is crucial for a startup gearing up to hit the market. “I think that’s really important, because if your existing pre-seed investor won’t lead your seed, that can be quite a difficult moment to go out to the market, when you may not have that many proof-points to try and get another external investor in,” Smith added."
314,SpaceX’s successful failure is a wake-up call for Starship’s timeline,['@breadfrom'],"April 21, 2023","SpaceX launched a fully integrated Starship launch vehicle for the first time on Thursday morning, a long-awaited and highly anticipated milestone in the vehicle development program. The orbital test flight surpassed many expectations. The vehicle cleared Max Q – the point at which the most aerodynamic pressure is exerted on the vehicle – and flew for nearly three minutes despite eight of its 33 rocket engines failing. The rocket reached an altitude of almost 40 kilometers, the point of stage separation, at which time the upper stage failed to separate from the booster, leading to uncontrolled tumbling and a spectacular midair explosion. Despite its fiery fate, the test was a success: SpaceX got tons of valuable data that will inform future Starship and Super Heavy prototypes. But for all the wins, the test was a stark reminder that Starship mission timelines are in need of a reset. The Starship’s attempt at an orbital launch showed impressive progress but also that the company still has a long way to go before achieving its super-heavy launch ambitions. Beyond the technical issues with the rocket itself, the sheer power of the Raptor engines at takeoff produced a massive crater underneath the orbital launch mount. It’s unclear how much work will be required to repair the site, or if it can be salvaged at all. Either way, ground infrastructure issues could impose significant delays to later tests — perhaps delaying the next one by months. SpaceX currently has three private human spaceflight missions on its Starship manifest. Those include Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa’s dearMoon flight around the moon, the third mission in billionaire Jared Isaacman’s Polaris Program, and a separate lunar mission later this decade, for which entrepreneur Dennis Tito and his wife Akiko purchased two seats. Of these, only dearMoon has a launch date: later this year. This was optimistic to begin with when they announced it in 2021 but now it seems downright ludicrous. SpaceX has also won lucrative contracts with NASA, performing a crucial role in the Artemis lunar landing program. Artemis III will see astronauts launch to space inside an Orion atop a Space Launch System vehicle, after which they will rendezvous with a Starship human landing system. From there they will travel to the lunar surface and back — but whether that can be achieved as planned in 2025 is doubtful. Between now and then, SpaceX must fly at least one uncrewed Starship and land it on the lunar surface before NASA can deem the vehicle ready to carry astronauts. The Artemis III plan also involves SpaceX sending up multiple reusable tankers and a propellant storage depot, with Starship refueling on-orbit to ensure it can make all the orbital burns required for the mission. All of these components of the mission are affected by delays to the core Starship testing program. Needless to say, the plan is enormously complicated. SpaceX will not just need to send Starship to orbit once, but again and again. It will have to prove out a high degree of safety before NASA allows astronauts to fly on it, demonstrate on-orbit refueling and achieve reusability. At this pace, it’s more realistic to hope for Artemis III happening any time before 2030. Does that mean NASA made the wrong choice in selecting SpaceX for its human landing system, or that Maezawa and Isaacman bet on the wrong horse? Not at all. But it does mean that all of us should temper our expectations about what the rest of this decade might hold for human spaceflight."
315,Green Labs secures $38.4M in debt financing about a month after conducting layoff,['@kateparknews'],"March 30, 2023","Green Labs, a Seoul-based agritech startup, has secured $38.4 million (50 billion won) in debt financing from existing investors BRV Capital Management and Skylake Incuvest. The new funding comes just a month after the startup laid off around 70% of its workforce, or 350 people, in February as part of a restructuring,  Green Labs CEO Sanghoon Shin said in an interview with TechCrunch that it now has a headcount of 150 people, adding that the company’s selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) had been reduced by about 80% compared to year-end 2022. The startup has built smart farming software and hardware for farmers to digitize the entire agriculture value chain, from crop to distribution. Shin told me the company’s “Farm Morning” app aggregates farm data, then artificial intelligence gives insights into crop lifecycle and also provides a network through which farmers can connect and share insights. Indeed, 900,000 farmers currently use the app in South Korea, and that figure has tripled in the past 12 months since its launch in 2021, Shin said. It also operates B2B marketplace Sinsun Market, and it has the ambition to be a LinkedIn for farmers, Shin added.  Green Labs, which raked in $140 million in a Series C in January 2022, ran out of money as it overstretched its expansion, TechCrunch reported last month. This time, Shin walked me through what happened to the company and how it plans to revive. The major cause was its new service, accounts receivable factoring, also known as invoice discounting. Green Labs purchases agriculture products from farmers and sells them to buyers/B2B partners with outstanding invoices. In other words, the startup pays farmers and buyers early and receives money from them late. It has thousands of B2B partners, according to Shin.  The problem arose when South Korea’s bond market froze in the second half of last year due to the default of the theme park Legoland. Financial firms began to suspend factoring financing of accounts receivables as market uncertainties grew.  Green Labs was borrowing money for cash liquidity with credit sales as collateral, but its lender, Lotte Card, suspended the factoring financing late last year, and the startup had to repay massive loans all at once. Green Labs had to go through with restructuring and layoffs.  Shin said the company generated sales of approximately $77 million in 2021 and more than $230 million in 2022.  The new money will go toward advancing the farm morning app and expanding its business in South Korea and Japan, Shin said. Green Labs already has 300,000 users in Japan after launching there in the fall of last year. When asked about its invoice discounting service, Shin said Green Labs will continue to act as a middleman for farmers and buyers, but will manage the business in a more conservative manner. Its global peers include Dehaart and Farmers Business Network. After the last funding, the company’s two investors, BRV Capital Management and Skylake, became the largest shareholder of Green Labs, while other investors, including SK Square and Shin, own the rest.

316,Zealy is an achievement system for web3 communities,['@romaindillet'],"April 4, 2023","Meet Zealy, a French startup that you may already know by the name Crew3. Zealy helps web3 (and web2) companies engage with their communities by giving them tasks that they can achieve in exchange for various rewards. The company just changed its name to Zealy, which indicates a larger focus beyond web3 companies. Last year, the startup raised $3.5 million in a funding round led by Redalpine. Other investors included Connect Ventures, Aglaé Ventures, Kima Ventures, Purple, STATION F, Founders Future, Pareto Holdings and several business angels from The Sandbox, POAP, DFNS, Starton and Pianity. “Zealy is an action layer on top of every application,” co-founder and CEO Mathis Grosjean told me. Companies use Zealy in combination with a Discord server, a subreddit, or any kind of community hub to create gamified tasks for the most enthusiastic community members. Tasks include creating user-generated content, boosting something on social networks or coding a web page. They relay those tasks to their community so that they can complete them before, during or after a product launch, for instance. Companies can use it for a new NFT drop, a physical event or a major product release. The reason why a product like Zealy exists is that many companies are already implementing gamified tasks for their communities. But they use products like Google Forms and relay those tasks in a Discord channel. It’s a manual process, and Zealy wants to automate those use cases. “We help companies onboard, educate, entertain and grow their communities without spending too much money, and in a scalable manner,” Grosjean said. Fredrika Lindh and Louis Demeslay are the two other co-founders of the company. But why would users want to complete those tasks? Zealy customers can grant rewards for certain tasks. For instance, users could get a special status on a Discord server, get digital assets, merch and more. If these competitions work well, community members might want to complete as many tasks as possible to climb the leaderboards. Companies using Zealy can even leverage this data to identify the most engaged users in their communities. Clients can create community sprints with a leaderboard that resets after a few weeks. In many ways, Zealy works a lot like video game achievements and online ladder ranking systems. When it comes to bringing new users to the platform, Zealy clients mostly bring their own communities to the service. That’s why the startup already has quite a few users: its 700,000 monthly active users have completed 100 million tasks so far. While Zealy originally focused on web3 projects, the startup realized that more traditional companies could use a community tool like Zealy to improve their community strategy. For instance, Renault and PMU have been using the service. Overall, 2,000 companies are using the platform. “In the current market, every company in the world will potentially try to become a community-led company,” Grosjean said. The Zealy team hopes that their startup has a shot at becoming the operating system for community-led companies."
317,Another Starship explosion would be bad news for nearby park managers,['@breadfrom'],"April 19, 2023","Starship’s upcoming test does not have a very high probability of success, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Last month, he put the chances of success at around 50%; in a Twitter Spaces earlier this week, he seemed to downgrade that probability even further. “If we do launch, I would consider anything that does not result in the destruction of the launch mount itself, the launch pad […] I would consider that to be a win,” he said. The possibility of another testing anomaly at Starbase is likely not good news for environmental managers, who must oversee SpaceX’s clean-up efforts for any debris that falls on lands under their jurisdiction, like state parks. Past explosions at Starbase, the company’s testing and launch facility in southeastern Texas, have generated debris fields that have impacted the adjacent Brazos Island State Park and Boca Chica State Park. A test of Starship’s upper stage in March 2021 generated a debris field impacting across 700 acres of surrounding parkland, Shyamal Patel, SpaceX’s senior director of Starship operations, told regulators in a January 2022 email. The anomaly generated the largest debris field of all the Starship explosions to date, Patel added. The final piece of debris from SN11 was an approximately 1,500-pound actuator component, Leonardo Alaniz, SpaceX’s manager of environmental, health and safety, reported to regulators in June 2021. The company had to submit a retrieval plan, involving the use of a heavy-duty Case 210 excavator, to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) before removing it from the site. The emails between SpaceX and government officials, including those from the FWS, the TPWD and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), were reviewed as part of a Freedom of Information Act request filed by TechCrunch. Coordinating the debris retrieval due to the SN11 anomaly was “a substantial burden” upon FWS staff time, FWS wildlife refuge manager Sonny Perez said in a June 2021 email to FAA officials. Part of the source of that burden, it seems, was the short lead times from SpaceX regarding road closures due to Starship vehicle testing. Perez told Alaniz in April 2021 that these closures delayed or prevented response teams accessing the debris site to monitor clean-up efforts. In one instance, Perez said a short-notice closure resulted in the assistant refuge manager, who was onsite to oversee SN11 debris retrieval efforts, being asked to leave early. The refuge manager and a wildlife biologist were denied access to the site altogether. Perez did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment, but an FWS spokesperson told TechCrunch that a “multi-agency response team” works with SpaceX to respond and assess debris. Reagan Faught, a park superintendent with TPWD, told TechCrunch that the agency has had to shift its approach in establishing protocols with SpaceX after the company shifted to Starship testing in 2020. “The retrieval of anomaly debris must be done in a delicate manner to avoid further disturbance to the sensitive algal tidal flats, loma habitats, and nesting habitat in the area,” he said. “We have actively worked with SpaceX on how best to perform those retrieval efforts and will continue to improve the retrieval process.” In the best case scenario, tomorrow’s Starship orbital flight test will generate no debris at all, with the Super Heavy booster and upper stage both making separate ocean splashdowns after launch. But in the Twitter Spaces interview, Musk entreated the public to set their expectations accordingly, adding that to expect success “would be insane.” The story has been updated to reflect Reagan Faught’s pronouns.

318,Conventional wisdom,['@bheater'],"March 23, 2023","If you’d told me five years ago that I would be flying to Chicago in March to attend a supply chain and logistics show, you would have been greeted by a momentary blank stare, followed by the image of a man attempting to determine in real time where his life went off-track. This is absolutely no criticism of supply chain and logistics shows generally — nor the people who attend them — but it’s a surprising destination, given where I envisioned my career heading. Taking the elevator to the fourth-floor press center on Monday, I was struck by how (in a significantly more metaphorical sense) supply chain and logistics shows came to me. I’ve covered robotics off and on for around a decade now, but it was only in the past five or six years that it became a core component of my work. In that same time, the warehouse world has changed dramatically to the point where ProMat is more robotics than not. The fourth floor of McCormick Place affords that kind of bird’s-eye view. The first thing you see looking out those windows is the giant Locus sign. Look beyond that in either direction, and you can spot virtually every one of the company’s competitors. This morning at my extremely unofficial office hours at a nearby cafe, a woman who works for U.K.-based Dexory described the inventory automation’s rough location on the show floor as being in the “robotics hall.” I countered that there’s no robotics hall if all the halls are robotics. Locus Robotics Acquires Waypoint Robotics Image Credits: Locus Robotics Locus Robotics Acquires Waypoint Robotics Image Credits: Locus Robotics Walking down the physical margins of the show, you’ll see more traditional vendors. These are the people who make slip guards and plastic barriers. It’s easy enough to imagine five to ten years ago, when they set up shop closer to the show’s center, and those early robotics startups were the weirdos. Those more traditional products are, of course, still very much a necessary part of operating a warehouse or fulfillment center, but they’re suddenly out of the spotlight here, having been slowly pushed to the sides by tech companies flush with the VC cash necessary to build giant, garish two-story booths. At a post-show happy hour last night, a VC asked me what the hardest part of learning the industry was. I told him that it wasn’t the robotics or AI. Sure, there’s a lot of extremely complex stuff happening under the hood that I — a creative writing major — will likely never fully grasp. But if you’re reasonably sharp, you can figure enough things out in broad strokes to carry on conversations and ask the right questions. The hardest part is learning everything that surrounds the robots. You have to learn the ins and outs of the industries these technologies effectively exist to serve, and the fact is that — in a reasonably short amount of time — it will include virtually ever industry out there. Logistics is, of course, the first step. As you survey the show, things are thrown into a fascinating light when you recognize how much of the landscape was a direct result of Amazon’s 2012 acquisition of Kiva Systems. The first direct result was that seemingly overnight every retailer is thrust into the world of same- and next-day deliveries. For better or worse (mostly worse, if I’m being honest), that’s what customers expect now, and if you’re unable to deliver it, there’s a reasonably good chance they’ll leave for the one company that absolutely can. The other piece of that puzzle is that when Amazon buys a company like Kiva, it drops all of its customers. Suddenly, all of the people who relied on that technology are left out in the cold. Locus CEO Rick Faulk and I discussed how the company was born as a direct result of the acquisition. The 3PL company Quiet Logistics was suddenly cut off from Kiva access, so it went ahead and built its own. Locus was spun out three years later. A day later, 6 River Systems (now owned by Shopify) co-founder and co-CEO Jerome Dubois told me that he had served as Kiva’s director of global sales and worked directly with Faulk. Small worlds within small worlds. 6 River Systems flagship robot, Chuck, helps warehouse workers pick items faster. Image Credits: 6 River Systems 6 River Systems flagship robot, Chuck, helps warehouse workers pick items faster. Image Credits: 6 River Systems Not every company’s origin story directly parallels either of these, of course. Some big players in the logistics space built their own robotics divisions in-house, while Zebra-owned Fetch is a descendant of Willow Garage. But how that South Bay startup’s collapse launched its own micro-industry is a story for another day, friends. While it’s been more than a decade since Amazon bought Kiva, there’s still a sense walking around these halls that we’re very much at the beginning of something. You can’t shake the feeling that something bigger is happening here. Even fierce competitors express a kind of mutual admiration, all while giving you a knowing glance that, actually, they have the real technology in the pipeline that will truly disrupt the industry. Walk around for a few more minutes, and you’ll notice something also. Something like 80% to 90% (completely pulling this number out of my butt here) of the robots fit into one of two categories. First are those Kiva-style mobile robots (the big Roomba, if you will). There are differentiators, of course, but broadly, these are robots that drive around a warehouse floor — either autonomously or following around a human — carrying goods. That could be boxes, or it could be tools — whatever relatively small thing it is. They’re often, but not entirely, a departure from the Amazon systems, which are designed to move shelving units around. Image Credits: Getty Images / Teera Konakan Image Credits: Getty Images / Teera Konakan The other big robot archetype is one we all know and love: the robotic manipulator. The classics are classics for a reason. Here these things are generally used to pick up and place items in boxes. The exhibitors were a mix of arm manufacturers (Kuka, Fanuc, Yaskawa) and startups that utilize those arms (including Covariant, Ambi — competitors birthed out of neighboring UC Berkeley Labs). Generative AI was somewhat top of mind (SVB, too, but for dramatically different reasons, of course). Hyped, yes, but I’m comforted by the fact that this space wasn’t all-in on the whole blockchain/crypto thing a few months back. Adopting new technologies is largely pragmatic here. Some see the category informing their work. Learnings from the space could prove useful in teaching robotics or in fleet management, for example. The responses to my questions were predictably measured in this room full of deeply practical people. There are two key reasons companies buy robots beyond the above Amazon conversation. The first is smaller and more cynical: it’s good PR. This usually manifests itself in front of house deployments. A robot barista, for example, isn’t especially useful right now, but it certainly looks neat. Consumers are attracted to neat. I might shoot some vertical video for TechCrunch’s TikTok account, but I’m not going to write some 1,000-word article drilling down on its machinations, while telling that you’re looking at the future. It’s also, frankly, important to show shareholders that yours is a forward-thinking business that is continually evolving to adapt to these ever-changing times. That’s where pilots come in, which is, in turn, why at lot of announcements you see around early trials ultimately don’t bear fruit. The second is purely economic. It’s obvious on the face of it, but companies buy products that save time and money. If the technologies fail to do so, they will likely be abandoned. I won’t bore you with my spiel about the potential for human collateral — I’ve had my fill of, let’s say, spirited discussions on the subject this week, and I will likely remain skeptical, because someone has to. But the question of how many humans and robots to staff a warehouse with is governed by the bottom line. The novelty of these robots wears off extremely fast. If they’re not living up to their promise, it’s time for a new approach. While there are some technologies here that can outperform human labor, I’ve found that, by and large, human speed is currently the gold stand. Take palletizing. It’s an impressive and complex feat with a lot of variables (though truck loading has an added layer of complexity and is therefore still aspirational for many solutions), and doing it at the same speed as a person is the current target for many. But charging units excepted, robots don’t take breaks and can work through the night as needed – and are therefore an appealing option for many companies. As I see it, there are presently two magic bullets for the industry. The first exists in that liminal space between the aforementioned robotic form factors. If I were a VC in the robotics space right now, in addition to making a lot more money, I would be hyperfocused on precisely this. Whoever develops a truly mobile robot capable of maneuvering down factory aisles (i.e., around the size of a 6 River/Locus/Fetch robot) mounted with a mobile manipulator capable of picking things off the shelf at a decent clip and a variety of speeds should clear out room in their driveway for the Brinks truck delivery. It’s hard to overstate how much this will crack things wide open, and many of the aforementioned companies are less interested in going back to the drawing board than addressing the current massive market of factories looking to take the first steps toward automation. Image Credits: SVT Robotics Image Credits: SVT Robotics That brings me to magic bullet two: interoperability. An important thing to remember: While we’re not quite at the point of lights-out fulfillment centers (manufacturing is a different story), getting close requires a lot of different solutions from a lot of different companies. There’s a reason Amazon has made a bunch of subsequent acquisitions — these are, for the most part, single-purpose systems. Beyond this, a lot of larger companies have opted to diversify so as to not get left in a lurch similar to what Staples, Gap and Office Depot experienced post-acquisition. Putting all your eggs in a single basket leaves you in an extremely uncomfortable position when the competition buys and discontinues support for the technology into which you’ve poured countless time and money. The broader question here is how a warehouse operator gets all of these heterogenous systems to play nicely with each other. That requires fleet management, data exchange and complementary components among others. Everyone’s got their own systems with their own technologies and APIs, and so far there’s no approach here akin to the Matter Alliance that was co-created by all of the biggest names in the smart home space. (I write about a lot of consumer electronics. These are analogies my brain can make sense of). A lot of companies have built their own in-house fleet management software, with varying degrees of interoperability (very much trending to the low end). A number of solutions are currently looking to be that truly hardware-agnostic platform for deployment and control. I had a nice chat this afternoon with SVT Robotics out of Virginia, which is one of the more compelling operators in the space and has partnerships with all of the big hardware players. MassRobotics’ push to create interoperability standards is absolutely in the conversation as well. Founded in 2020, the org describes its plan thusly, The group’s mission is to develop standards that will allow organizations to deploy autonomous mobile robots AMRs from multiple vendors and have them work together in the same environment, better realizing the promise of warehouse and factory automation. These standards will allow autonomous vehicles of different types to share information about their location, speed, direction, health, tasking/availability, and other performance characteristics with similar vehicles so they can better coexist on a warehouse or factory floor. Image Credits: Pickle Robot Image Credits: Pickle Robot As to more immediate issues, truck unloading (and eventual truck loading) was a big deal this year. This is among the crappiest warehouse jobs you can assign to a human. In addition to being incredibly rough on the body, the shipping containers mostly sit outside of a warehouse, exposing them to the elements, which makes them unbearably hot or cold. “We thought that was the hardest problem, and it hadn’t been solved yet,” Pickle CEO Andrew Meyer told me. There’s a reason Boston Dynamics’ first purpose-built commercially available robot is focused on this category. The company’s head of warehouse, Kevin Blankespoor, told me how their own Stretch could be the first step to a bigger world, including magic bullet number one mentioned above. “I think there are versions of something that looks like Stretch, or even a combination of Stretch and Atlas,” he said, “where it’s a smaller footprint that works in a tighter space. We’re excited about all of these things.” It’s also, frankly, not difficult to imagine breakthroughs made here that inform future robots in different categories, much like the way autonomous driving gave a huge boost to warehouse robotics. Systems designed for agriculture, construction and the home will almost certainly take cues from what continues to be the hottest robotics category. Image Credits: Agility Robotics Image Credits: Agility Robotics Certainly Agility’s Digit feels like a peek at a broader world. Warehouse is really the tip of the spear as far as applications for legged robots — it’s simply the task that makes the most sense right now from the standpoint of market need. General-purpose humanoid robots continue to be a hot topic now, but efficacy is a huge question mark. I believe that also applies to drone inventory systems like Corvus, Gather AI and Verity, which were all clustered in the back of the hall, in a sport reserved for smaller startups. I love the idea of finding more practical uses for drones, and hope someone cracks this. Walk around the floor long enough, and you’ll overhear dozens of conversations about RaaS (robotics as a service). All the cool kids are monetizing with it. Certainly some manner of subscription model makes sense in most instances. These systems cost a lot up front — money many in the mid-market and below don’t have on-hand. A monthly fee also affords opportunities to issue software improvements and support. Another happy side effect of the model is a sustainability angle. As Faulk pointed out, the raas approach affords Locus the ability to keep devices in circulation. If something stops working, you ship it back, they fix it out and send it back out to you or someone else. Ditto if the customer is simply done with the service — do some repairs, rebadge it and send it to a new client. Faulk told me that of all the Locus units deployed in the world, only a handful or two (unclear if it’s a metric or imperial handful) have been scrapped. As for what took those robots out of circulation? He had a simple response: forklifts. Crushing the robot from above with a couple of big metal prongs is apparently the one surefire way to take a LocusBot out of circulation — information you’ll hopefully never need to put into practice. That’s precisely the model companies want when dealing with unproven startups. You certainly don’t want to be in a position of spending a bunch of money upfront on a product that folds the next day. Bigger companies with established partners, on the other hand, may find more value in just buying a solution out right. The consensus answer here is to figure out want clients want and work it out for them. Offer both solutions and, perhaps, a hybrid. Don’t add obstacles where the aren’t necessary. It’s been a productive few days for me, and I may end up becoming a regular on the supply chain and logistics circuit as a result. There’s so much I just managed to scratch the surface of. I had some productive chats about things like packing tracking software I’m looking forward to digging into (cue the press releases). Vision systems are extremely impressive and only getting better. Fun nugget from speaking with startups like SLAMCore and Covariant: Lidar is really out of vogue here. Stereoscopic cameras already do something better (e.g., reflective surfaces) and are catching up on the rest. That’s why there are Intel RealSense and competitors in most of the new robots you’ll see. I’ve got to hop. There’s one more VC happy hour I need to get to. If you told me five years ago that I would be saying that, I would have probably smugly replied, “Yeah, obviously.” I’m working on that part of my personality. Listen, it’s a process. I’m going to leave you with a chunk of my conversation with Boston Dynamics’ Kevin Blankespoor because I think it’s super interesting and hopefully you will, too. Lots more to start transcribing on the way home. See you next year in Atlanta, probably. Meantime, I still have a handful of interviews from the event I need to post, so look for those on the site and in next week’s newsletter. Image Credits: Boston Dynamics Image Credits: Boston Dynamics TC: Boston Dynamics didn’t have a focus on commercializing for a long time. It really happened under SoftBank. KB: Google a little bit, but SoftBank was the big push, for sure. Atlas’ ability to move around boxes was more of an edge case. There was interest from potential clients, but there was never a plan to commercialize. Yeah. [Atlas] is a general-purpose robot, so if you want to go explore an application, it can do the vast majority of them, just like a person can. It may not be the right optimization when you’re said and done, but it’s how you understand the application and you can peel off and do a derivation of Atlas, basically, and go make that into a product. With Atlas and case handling, we found that to be an attractive match, and I peeled off a big part of the Atlas team to do Handle, the two-wheeled robot. That was a foray into combining wheels and legs, which we always wanted to do, but also it was a little more simple and could handle cases in a warehouse. We actually did a few experiments with customers there and then we went to Stretch. But it all really started with Atlas. A lot of the hardware tidbits from Atlas and Spot are on Stretch. It’s totally different, but under the hood, there are similarities. What’s an example? If you look at the hip actuators on Spot, they’re basically the same as the wrist actuators on Stretch, but Stretch is a lot bigger. The vision system across Atlas, Stretch and Spot all use a lot of shared software. We really don’t have to start from scratch when we bite off a new product. We have a big war chest of technological building blocks. Was Kinema a part of that? On the box detection side, absolutely. Kinema has the best box detection machine learning pipeline out there. We’ve expanded it a lot on Stretch, but that’s absolutely what it’s running now. Discussing truck unloading has been eye-opening. Not only is it extremely physically taxing on workers, but those trailers are also exposed to the outdoors, making it extremely hot or cold inside. It can be dangerously hot. Sometimes I’m shocked to see that they let people go in when it’s 110 degrees in there. And it gets super cold in the winter. Is hot or cold harder? Cold is generally a challenge. We did bigger temperature extremes in our DARPA days. When you go out in the snow, and nobody’s laptop will boot up, but your robot still does. But once you’re up and running, robots generate their own heat. That’s why there’s cooling vents all over it. The computers heat up, the actuators heat up. That works against you in hot environments. Everyone is talking about humanoids right now. After so many years and so much money in R&D, you had a lot of potential customers expressing interest. Did you explore the humanoid form factor for what ultimately became Stretch? We didn’t explore the route because we thought it would be somewhat more expensive and complex than it needs to be. Keep in mind, that was about seven years ago. It’s amazing that we’re able to sit here and talk about maybe four or five different companies that are going after real products with humanoid robots. That’s fantastic. Even Agility has something humanlike. They’re definitely in that conversation. I’m just excited that if you had asked me that five or 10 years ago, I’d so, “Oh, that’s way too expensive. That’s way too complicated.” And now you’re finding multiple companies are looking at this and saying, “We think there can be a real business here.” But for you, the move was focusing on the best robot for a single, specific task. That’s how we ended up with Stretch. It is a multipurpose robot in that the hardware is capable of doing lots of different jobs in warehouses. We’re starting off unloading trucks as our first application. That’s our first focus, but we are also in time going to be able to do things like build pallets and load trucks. In the future, a day in the life of Stretch might be spending the morning on the in-bound side and unloading boxes from containers. And spend the afternoon in the warehouse building pallets and it might move in the evenings to the outbound side loading boxes back into trucks. It really is going to be a single robot that you can do for multiple jobs. It sounds like that’s far off. We’re rolling out new applications every couple of years. We’re focused on getting it out of the gate. Why didn’t Handle work out? The counterweight system was very cool, but was it ultimately more robot than was needed for the situation? We actually found that Handle wasn’t fast enough. We took Handle out for a couple of different trial runs in warehouses. The first application was pallet loading, which looked pretty good. The second was truck unloading. What we found with Handle in the back of a truck is it had to do a fair amount of maneuvering in the space to move a single box […] It would take about 25 seconds per box. People can move a box in maybe five seconds. We knew we needed to hit that kind of number for a return on investment. Stretch can do that. It uses the arm more completely and only moves the base when it needs to. We were talking about Stretch moving from Point A to Point B in a warehouse. But when it’s working on a shelving system, it’s able to move along the shelves [for picking]? Correct. Interoperability is the big topic of conversation this week. What is Boston Dynamics’ approach to this? If you want close to a fully autonomous robot at this point, you’re going to have to work with a lot of different robots from a lot of different companies. Absolutely. It’s a hot topic. Both heterogenous fleet management. We’re seeing a lot of different companies take that on. We have prototyped our own fleet manager to understand what the hard parts are. Spot has Scout, which is its own web client for teleoperation, industrial inspection and autonomy. So we have a version of a fleet manager now. I think we have yet to see how that’s going to shake out. Developing your own fleet manager is a resource-intensive way to understand the problem. Yeah. I mean, part of it was that, to do the things we wanted to do, there wasn’t a fleet manager you could buy. One of the things we want to do as a future application is case pick. That’s where the robot is in the aisle and it’s building up pallets of different boxes. It’s a really big application. We’ve played with different ways to do that. One is with autonomous forklifts. It moves the pallet through the facility back and forth down the aisles and Stretch rendezvous at each point location and the pallet wrap. We’ve prototyped that. We’ve done it with a couple of different partners. We’ve done it with Stretch on its own, where it’s dragging its own pallet, just to get a feel for where the hard parts are. But you’ve decided not to go further with that? No, we will. We basically decided to focus on application number one right now. We want to get it to the performance, reliability and robustness that customers are happy with. That’s all hands on deck. But we’ve still got a lot of the software and knowledge from when we did the picking thing I described, and that will pick up in the not too distant future. So we can expect to see fleet management software from Boston Dynamics? Maybe. To be determined. We’ll definitely have that for our robots. Will we have a heterogeneous manager that will work with other robots? I don’t know. You survey the landscape, and if someone is already doing it well, you focus your attention elsewhere. Exactly. We don’t want to do that as a primary business. If we can buy something that really works, that would be really interesting. You mentioned the mobile picking robot. I think that’s a magic bullet. If you’ve cracked that, you’ve cracked warehouses. Yeah. And even more generally, the thing I’m excited about is mobile manipulation. If you move around these types of shows, you’ll see a lot of mobility. There are a lot of autonomous mobile robots and forklifts. You’ll see a lot of people doing just manipulation — everything from cobots to industrial arms. But there really is nothing out there at scale that does mobility and manipulation together. I spoke with the CEOs of Locus and 6 River Systems. They’re really just operating in that mobility segment and having a lot of success. But successfully mounting an arm to one of those robots in a way that works is going to be huge for this industry. I don’t know that they have the motivation to tackle something even more complicated. They have so much market penetration to go with the existing product. But for us, it’s core to what we do. Stretch is a mobile manipulation robot. It’s in the warehouse now. I think we’re going to grow in the warehouse for a long time. It’s going to go beyond the warehouse in time. Spot with an arm is a very capable mobile manipulation robot. Atlas as well, we’re starting to get more into manipulation. For Boston Dynamics, that really is the evolution, to go into mobile manipulation. What is the upper weight threshold for Stretch’s picks? Fifty pounds. What are the constraints, in terms of weight? A couple. Grasping is one. Suction is amazing. People are always amazed by how much it can pick up. But, when you start getting into imperfections like a damaged box — those top boxes, you can’t fit the gripper above it. You have to get the front face. That’s where some of the limitations come in. If we’re talking about a mobile system that can pick, in order to compete with companies like Zebra, Locus and 6 River Systems, you’re going to have to scale down. Does that make sense for Stretch? Yeah, absolutely. I think there are versions of something that looks like Stretch, or even a combination of Stretch and Atlas, where it’s a smaller footprint that works in a tighter space. We’re excited about all of these things. Repeatability has to be one of the biggest issues entering the commercial space. Yeah. Making a cool demo video is great, and I love it. I’ve done a lot of them. The difference between that and a product that works for a customer all day, every day, has sufficient hardware reliability and software robustness so it can handle all of the surprises you get — that’s an order of magnitude more work. That’s what we’ve done with Stretch. Stretch is never going to be a highlight reel, but Stretch works. More TechCrunch"
319,"Blockchain messaging protocol LayerZero raises $120M, hitting $3B valuation",['@jacqmelinek'],"April 4, 2023"," LayerZero Labs, a web3 messaging protocol, has closed a $120 million Series B round, raising its valuation to $3 billion from $1 billion, the company said on Tuesday. Unlike Web 2.0 messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, this messaging protocol lets users send different types of messages between blockchains, like cross-chain interactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries. “It’s pure arbitrary data; it’s like internet-packaged messaging between computers, not like instant messaging,” Bryan Pellegrino, CEO and co-founder of LayerZero Labs, told TechCrunch. “It’s the movement of data.” LayerZero connects over 30 mainnet blockchains, including two non-Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs), Aptos and Solana, Pellegrino noted. The protocol is used by on-chain applications like decentralized exchanges, including the likes of PancakeSwap, Sushiswap, Trader Joe and Uniswap. The platform has secured over $7 billion in total value locked and processed over $6 billion in transactional volume, the startup said. Since launching about a year ago, “hundreds of thousands of unique users” have used the protocol, Pellegrino said. It took the protocol about 7.5 months to hit 1 million messages; then it took 2.5 months to hit the next million messages, Pellegrino said. “Everything else is rapidly evolving. By the end of this year, I’m extremely confident that we’ll have single months, if not single weeks, where there’s a million messages.” The round was raised for “purely strategic alignment,” Pellegrino said — meaning they didn’t really need the money. The Series B round saw 33 investors participating, including a16z crypto, Circle Ventures, Sequoia Capital, OpenSea, Samsung Next, Christie’s and BOND. The company, which previously raised $135 million in March 2022, has raised over $250 million to date, he added. “We wanted to make a push into gaming and the APAC market, and all of this [capital] is largely to grow the company there,” Pellegrino said. “If we want to be that layer that connects everything, gaming plays a huge role in that.” In the long-term, Pellegrino hopes LayerZero’s messaging protocol, and others, continues to create the infrastructure that allows applications to build more complex structures. “Our job is to build the primitive that allows developers to create the best systems they can, whether its games, DeFi applications or something else.”"

321,"Silicon Valley Bank’s chief risk officer is out, months after taking the job",['@nmasc_'],"April 11, 2023","When Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse was first unfolding, a belated disclosure colored some of the chaos: The bank spent most of last year without a chief risk officer, and the one who left sold more than $4 million of stock in the bank before departing. The new CRO, Kim Olson, who joined in January 2023, was only three months on the job before the bank was shut down by regulators. Now, sources tell TechCrunch that Olson and at least one other executive are leaving SVB, too. Sources said SVB’s chief audit executive is also leaving the business. The departure comes just two weeks after a $72 billion chunk of SVB was bought by First Citizens Bank. The recent departures are on top of a string of executive exits, including former CEO Greg Becker and CFO Daniel Beck, who left when the bank was taken over by regulators. SVB and Olson did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for further comment on Olson’s departure. Employees at the newly combined institution do not yet know who the new chief risk officer will be. A potential successor is First Citizens’ CRO Lorie Rupp, who has been in the role since 2017. Talent moves are sure to continue as a natural part of SVB’s transition to new ownership. It’s been a little over a month since Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by regulators.   Today, HSBC USA announced that it hired 40 bankers from SVB to help build a new offering “dedicated to the innovation economy,” according to a statement sent to TechCrunch. The bank has poached veteran SVB talent, including chief business development officer Sunita Patel, head of Life Science and healthcare Katherine Andersen, head of tech and healthcare banking David Sabow and head of technology credit solutions Melissa Stepanis who will oversee technology.

322,Confusion sets in as Meta content moderators go without pay,['@annienjanja'],"May 5, 2023","Content moderators under Sama, Meta’s content review sub-contractor in Africa, earlier today picketed at the company’s headquarters in Kenya demanding April salary, while urging it to observe the court orders that barred it from conducting mass layoffs. The demonstrations came after Sama, in an email, instructed moderators to clear with the company by May 11, a move the employees say is against the existing court orders. The 184 moderators sued Sama for allegedly laying them off unlawfully, after it wound down its content review arm in March, and Majorel, the social media giant’s new partner in Africa, for blacklisting on instruction by Meta. The court issued a temporary injunction on March 21 barring Sama from effecting any form of redundancy, and Meta from engaging Majorel, which was also instructed to refrain from blacklisting the moderators. Sama was directed to continue reviewing content on Meta’s platforms, and to be its sole provider in Africa pending determination of the case. However, Sama sent the moderators on compulsory leave in April saying it had no work for them as its contract with Meta had expired. Sama told TechCrunch that it had sent the notice “to staff whose contract had expired to go through our regular clearance process. This clearance process involves the return of company equipment to make sure that all final dues can be paid without deduction for that equipment, in accordance with Kenyan law.” It said the moderators’ contracts had ended in March after its deal with Meta expired, saying that it was only processing the moderators final dues. “We understand our former employees’ frustration because they were led by others to believe that they would all receive salary indefinitely while on leave, but that is not what the court dictated,” said Sama. Yet, Sama’s VP of global service delivery, Annpeace Alwala, had in an affidavit dated April 12, and seen by TechCrunch, asked the court to set aside the temporary injunction saying that keeping the content moderators came “with a serious cost implication.” Alwala had outlined that it would cost about $90,000 monthly to keep the moderators, and a further $135,000 to process their work permits and security bond. The moderators filed the suit alleging that Sama failed to issue redundancy notices, as required by Kenyan law. The suit also claims, among other issues, that the moderators were not issued with a 30-day termination notice, and that their terminal dues were pegged on their signing of non-disclosure documents. Sama says it observed the Kenyan law. Sama, whose long list of clientele includes OpenAI, dropped Meta’s contract and content review services, laying off 260 people in the process, to concentrate on labeling work (computer vision data annotation), following the heat from a 2022 lawsuit in Kenya by its former content moderator, Daniel Motaung. Motuang, a South African, had accused Sama and Meta of forced labor and human trafficking, unfair labor relations, union busting and failure to provide “adequate” mental health and psychosocial support. He was allegedly laid off for organizing a 2019 strike and trying to unionize Sama’s employees. Sama and Majorel moderators earlier this week voted to form a union.      "
323,"As the US cracks down on crypto, Hong Kong extends a warm welcome",['@ritacyliao'],"April 29, 2023","On a balmy day in mid-April, thousands of people queued in line to enter the Hong Kong Convention Center where the city’s inaugural web3 festival was underway. Most had flown in from mainland China, but many others had trekked from Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and even the U.S. to see what the city had to offer to crypto ventures at a time regulation over digital assets is intensifying in the U.S. In February, Hong Kong proposed a set of welcoming rules to regulate crypto-related activities. Under the new legal regime, retail investors will be allowed to trade certain digital assets on licensed exchanges, replacing a 2018 framework that restricted trading to only accredited investors. The city is also paving the way to legalize stablecoins. One startup, which is backed by popular exchange KuCoin and USDC issuer Circle, recently launched an offshore Chinese yuan (CNH)-pegged stablecoin, the first of its kind in Greater China. To create a favorable environment for web3 businesses, the city is facilitating communication between banks and crypto startups, many of which are scrambling to find alternatives following Silvergate Bank’s meltdown. These moves are contrasting with Beijing’s heavy-handed crackdown on the crypto industry; they also highlight the degree to which the former British colony enjoys policy exceptions in certain areas, such as finance. In 2021, China outlawed all forms of crypto transactions, sending the country’s web3 entrepreneurs fleeing to more web3-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore. With Hong Kong extending a welcoming hand to digital assets, many Chinese founders in self-exile are weighing the option of setting up in the city. Companies from the West are also evaluating Hong Kong as a potential outpost for their Asia expansion. At the weeklong Hong Kong web3 festival, TechCrunch talked to a dozen participants from the web3 realm, including investors, nascent startups and established players, as well as “traditional” web2 tech giants, to gauge Hong Kong’s attractiveness as the next crypto hub. Some believe the new regulatory regime will spawn a new wave of crypto innovation. They feel reassured that they can now operate as a legitimate business on Chinese soil and are quick to tap the government’s policy support, such as subsidized office space for crypto ventures. Others are more hesitant to accept the olive branch. As Asia’s financial center, Hong Kong doesn’t historically have a vibrant tech ecosystem and is too expensive for most scrappy startups, so the types of crypto businesses it attracts will likely be those serving and interfacing with traditional finance, they reckon. The timing is favorable for Hong Kong’s friendly move on crypto, said Shixing Mao, co-founder and CEO at Cobo, a Singapore-headquartered digital asset custody solution backed by DST Global. “The tightening of regulation in the U.S. after the FTX implosion has a few consequences. In the past, several American banks played the key role of linking the traditional and crypto worlds, but that link is now broken, which presents a great opportunity for Hong Kong to step up,” said Mao, who is amicably known as “Discus Fish” in the crypto community. “Hong Kong has always been at the intersection of the East and West and played the important role as the bridge to enter China,” observed Lily King, chief operating officer at Cobo. That advantage was already proven before. Hong Kong played an important role in the early development of the crypto industry by drawing once-influential exchanges like FTX and Bitmex to set up shops there. Following China’s crypto clampdown, FTX moved to the Bahamas for its friendlier and clearer regulatory stance toward the new asset class. Hong Kong is regaining some attention from the West. Stephen Cheung, president at decentralized social network Bi.social, flew all the way from the U.S. east coast to Hong Kong to feel the pulse on the ground. “As an American-born Chinese whose parents grew up in Hong Kong, I am extremely optimistic about the open door policy for crypto in Hong Kong,” he said. Nonetheless, Cheung believed that if American crypto firms are going to leave the country, “they will stay within the western hemisphere.” “Hong Kong has the possibility [of attracting Western firms] only because the U.S. is currently openly hostile towards web3 companies,” he said, adding that the city will be more appealing to other Asia-based companies before it will have any significant influence on the West. Indeed, Hong Kong is increasingly on the radar of crypto businesses in Singapore, many of which had come from China after the country’s crackdown on crypto. Now the tide is turning. “After FTX’s implosion, the Singapore government has grown more cautious towards crypto. Hong Kong, on the other hand, is trying to attract talent and companies to build the basic infrastructure of the crypto industry,” said Luke Huang, director of business development at Safeheron, a digital asset self-custody solution provider that is based in Singapore but recently set up an office in Hong Kong. For the most part, people are praising the Hong Kong government for providing more regulatory clarity on the crypto industry. But they are interpreting Hong Kong’s open arms differently. Some view the move as a sudden shift in the government’s attitude, while others see it as a reflection of the city’s policy consistency. HashKey Capital, one of the world’s largest web3 venture capital firms that recently closed a $500 million Fund III, belongs to the latter camp. The fund, which is Ethereum’s first institutional investor, set up in Hong Kong back in 2017 and has kept its office there since. “What we have seen [in Hong Kong] over the years is a relatively consistent government direction and sustainable policy,” said Chao Deng, the firm’s CEO. “The latest move is more of an update of the licensing regime.” Conflux, a Layer 1 blockchain that claims to be the only crypto company allowed to operate in China since the industry crackdown, was also put at ease after meeting various Hong Kong government delegates during the web3 festival. “Hong Kong is showing a tremendous amount of support for web3 development,” said Zhang Yuanjie, co-founder at Conflux. “From legislators and InvestHK [the city’s department of foreign direct investment] to its financial secretary and monetary authority, everyone is serious about supporting the crypto industry.” Even though Hong Kong’s new web3 regulation seems more favorable towards transaction-focused crypto services, there’s room for infrastructure builders, reckoned Huang from Safeheron. “Anyone entering the crypto industry needs cybersecurity infrastructure, whether it’s a traditional or web3 native company. Now that Hong Kong’s financial institutions might start integrating crypto-related products, we can play the role of helping to onboard them,” he said. China’s Big Tech is riding Hong Kong’s crypto wave, too. Alibaba and Tencent were both present at the web3 festival with representatives from their cloud computing units. Like AWS, they want to get a headstart and be the decentralized world’s go-to cloud provider. Even if the nascent industry won’t likely generate any meaningful revenue anytime soon, the tech giants evidently don’t want to miss out on an industry that keeps luring capital and talent from traditional industries. The web3 festival, with its teeming conference room and lavish boat parties, appears to be a euphoric celebration of the city’s new crypto regime. But not all attendees are hot-headed. One investor from a prominent China-focused venture capital firm, who declined to be named, said he wasn’t looking to source deals at the event because “it’s not where the real technical developers hang out.” Three Chinese web3 founders who have moved to Singapore and declined to be named said they were in Hong Kong simply to catch up with partners and investors and would “wait and see” before drawing any conclusion on the city’s level of crypto-friendliness. Those who tend to be the most passionate about Hong Kong’s new crypto regulation are fund managers, stock traders and others in traditional finance, observed Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures. “It’s not that they feel so much for crypto, but it’s more about looking for the next investable assets. Right now, the financial markets are slowing and they can’t find any other alternative assets,” said Lin. Prior to running the DeFi protocol, she worked in the global markets division at Deutsche Bank, managed overseas payments solutions at Ant Group and was a founding partner of major crypto lender Matrixport. “Crypto is very much close to what they’ve been doing in finance, unlike AI or biotech, which is something remote for them. I think the positive signal from the government also boosts their confidence,” she said. It comes as no surprise that Hong Kong is vouching for a fledgling industry that plays to its strength. In recent years, the city has seen an exodus of multinational corporations and local talent as it undergoes a string of political events. “Hong Kong has hit a big bottleneck in traditional industries like finance and real estate, so it’s in dire need of young talent and new blood to revitalize its economy,” said King. “Given the foundation it laid for the finance sector, focusing on digital assets is its best and only option going forward.”                    "
324,Over 300 gigafactories will make tomorrow’s EVs. We mapped them all,"['Miranda Halpern', 'Tim De Chant']","April 11, 2023","The automotive industry’s transition to electric vehicles is ushering in a tidal wave of demand for batteries that’s upending national industrial policies, reshaping geopolitics and sparking a surge of new factories that will pump out billions of cells. It may seem like the sector has exploded overnight, but founders, investors and multinationals have been laying the groundwork for this transition over the past decade. In that time, for example, venture capitalists and private equity firms have invested over $40 billion into battery technology startups, and some of those investments are now coming to fruition. Just like powerful, fast-charging cells facilitated the mobile electronics revolution of the last 20 years, ever more plentiful batteries stand to reshape everything from job site generators and wearable electronics to the entire electrical grid. That’s probably just the start."
325,What’s going on with the TikTok ban?,['@tayhatmaker'],"March 31, 2023","With a U.S. ban of TikTok looming, it might look like game over for the hit video sharing app, which has taken the world by storm in recent years, reshaping every aspect of culture in the process. Uncertainty abounds right now, but TikTok’s fate is far from sealed. We’ve answered some common questions about a situation that’s complex, confusing and changing as we speak. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress last week, enduring five hours of intense questioning from lawmakers over concerns that China might leverage the app to compromise U.S. national security. TikTok is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, setting it apart from other major social media companies based in the U.S. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said in his opening statements, a refrain TikTok’s CEO repeated throughout the hearing as he sought to reassure lawmakers. National security concerns were just one of the worries that representatives expressed about TikTok. Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also raised red flags over issues ranging from the app’s eating disorder content and viral challenges to its flimsy tools designed to prevent social media addiction among teens. Those concerns, which focus mainly on vulnerable underage users, are serious, but also issues that TikTok shares with U.S.-based social media companies like Instagram and YouTube. In many ways, the TikTok hearing went much like other major tech CEO hearings have gone in recent years. Lawmakers generally spent their time grandstanding and posturing for sound bites, dredging up little in the way of new information on TikTok, ByteDance or their operations in the process. Ultimately, the hearing isn’t likely to move the needle on TikTok’s domestic fate, but it does serve as a useful barometer for the headwinds the company faces in its biggest market. The effort to ban TikTok in the U.S. began during the Trump administration, but the Biden White House recently picked up the baton."
326,Pinterest expands its Creator Fund for underrepresented groups to five more countries,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 4, 2023","Pinterest announced today that it’s expanding its Creator Fund for underrepresented groups to five more countries, including Canada, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France. The company debuted its $500,000 Creator Fund in 2021, and announced an additional $1.2 million for the fund last year. Pinterest told TechCrunch in an email that it has invested a total of over $2.3 million in cash grants and ads credits for this specific program. The fund focuses specifically on supporting creators from underrepresented groups by offering both financial and educational resources. Pinterest says that since its inception, the fund has provided support to dozens of Creators from the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil, noting that they have received training and insights from experts in the field, personalized consulting and a financial grant in cash and ad credits. “Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and inspiration is fueled by diversity of experiences, perspectives and communities,” said Zeny Shifferaw, the Creator Inclusion Lead at Pinterest, in a statement. “Expanding this program will unlock more opportunities for disproportionately underrepresented creators and content producers to gain financial support, exposure, resources and reach new audiences looking to be inspired by their passions on our platform.” After announcing its Creator Fund in April 2021, Pinterest last fall said it would invest $20 million toward Creator Rewards in the United States, which would pay creators directly for participating in “challenges.” The company then shut down the program last November. The expansion comes as many companies have been rethinking and tweaking their creator programs. Meta committed $1 billion to creator bonus programs, but recently announced that it was pausing its Reels bonuses to creators on Facebook and Instagram. In addition, TikTok recently launched the beta version of a revamped creator fund called the “Creativity Program.” The company says the program is designed to generate higher revenue and unlock more opportunities for creators. TikTok’s original fund launched in 2020 with a $1 billion commitment over three years, and has been criticized by creators who have complained about low payouts.  "
327,Betterdata uses synthetic data to keep real data safe,['@catherineshu'],"April 20, 2023","Betterdata, a Singapore-based startup that uses programmable synthetic data to keep real data secure, announced today it has raised $1.55 million. The seed round, which it says was oversubscribed, was led by Investible with participation from Franklin Templeton, Xcel Next, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Bon Auxilium, Tenity, Plug and Play and Entrepreneur First. The startup was founded in 2021 by Dr. Uzair Javaid, its CEO, and chief technologist Kevin Yee, with the goal of making data sharing faster and more secure as data protection regulations increased around the world. The company is currently in research and development partnerships with two major universities in Singapore and the United States (it can’t publicly disclose who they are) and its clients include Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Betterdata says it is different from traditional data sharing methods that use data anonymization to destroy data because it utilizes generative AI and privacy engineering instead. Yee explained to TechCrunch that programmatic synthetic data uses generative models, like deep learning models, including generative adversarial models used in deepfakes, transformers used in ChatGPT and diffusion models used in stable diffusion, to create and augment new datasets. These synthetic datasets have similar characteristics and structure to real-world data without disclosing sensitive or private information about individuals. “The idea is to create a fictional version of a real dataset that can be used safely for a variety of purposes including safeguarding confidential data, reducing bias and also improving machine learning models,” he said. Programmatic synthetic data helps developers in many ways. A few examples include helping them protect sensitive data, comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, increase data availability between teams, create more data to train, test and validate machine learning models and address data imbalance issues by creating more records for underrepresented groups or classes. Betterdata’s funding will be used on its product launch and to enhance its programmable synthetic data tech stack, including support for single-table, multi-table and time-series datasets. These are different variations of tabular datasets and Yee explains that the main differences are their structures and the problems thy are created to address. For example, single-table datasets focus on standalone tables, while multi-table datasets are meant to consider relationships between multiple tables, and time-series datasets deal with data collected over time. Betterdata also plans to hire more people, including sales and marketing employees, and expand beyond Singapore to more of the Asia-Pacific region over the next one to two years. In a statement about Investible’s investment, principal Khairu Rejal said, “Betterdata solves one of the biggest issues the AI industry is facing today: lack of high-quality data that also meets privacy requirements. Through its powerful platform, Betterdata generates synthetic data that mimics real-world data without compromising quality and privacy, helping businesses meet global compliance and privacy laws at scale.”  "
328,We’re still talking about Y Combinator valuations,['@nmasc_'],"April 8, 2023","Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host Natasha Mascarenhas. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. Y Combinator’s new era, with smaller batches, a refocus only on early-stage investing and a new chief executive, is in full swing. As The TechCrunch team sat through hundreds of startup pitches during YC’s biannual Demo Day, the backdrop of change was certainly noted. For one, a majority of the early-stage investors I’ve spoken to have complained about the valuations coming out of the cohort, saying that it’s getting too pricey to invest. It’s a conversation that bubbles up around Demo Day time and time again, but given the downturn, some expected to see valuations that they think are more realistic for businesses only a few months old. I’m also hearing that YC’s new standard deal, specifically its most favored nation clause, has played a role in incentivizing founders to pursue higher valuations. There was a time when a startup, fresh out of the program, raised at a valuation north of $30 million, only to be beat the next year, when another startup out of YC raised at a $75 million valuation. (Both the aforementioned rounds were led by A16z, and to be fair, A16z did not complain to me about early-stage valuations). To me, high valuations have always been the conversation around YC. I don’t know what will change it, whether it’s a new competitor, a fresh influx of check-writers as some leave, or if the conversation even needs to disappear in the first place. I will say that if you build something people want, that’s great — you just have to keep that “want” alive as you build new iterations of that first product. Garry Tan, the new chief executive of YC, seemingly addressed some of the valuation conversations on Twitter. writing more broadly that “value investing in venture is like restricting your search for your lost keys under only brightly lit street lamps.” Tan added in the same thread, “Competition and high valuations exist because large possible markets represent large possible outcomes. Competition doesn’t mean a market or idea is bad, it typically means a great market that lots of people want … The best investors tend not to use heat as a signal one way or another.”  Much has changed since May 2022, when YC sent a memo to founders to “plan for the worst.”  … During economic downturns even the top tier VC funds with a lot of money slow down their deployment of capital (lesser funds often stop investing or die). This causes less competition between funds for deals which results in lower valuations, lower round sizes, and many fewer deals completed. In these situations, investors also reserve more capital to backstop their best performing companies, which further reduces the number of new financings. This slow down will have a disproportionate impact on international companies, asset heavy companies, low margin companies, hardtech, and other companies with high burn and long time to revenue. What I would really love is, when YC does its blog post introducing the batch, it would also offer some sort of analysis on which percentage of startups are raising at $8 million valuations versus $20 million valuations versus $45 million valuations. I wonder if it can clear up some misconceptions (or hey, I’ll even take it if they confirm them!). While we’re at it, the percentage of startups that go on to raise a Series A would also be a fascinating data point. Now, even if valuations have not come down for some YC startups, some of the aforementioned advice has been taken, specifically around the slowdown that will be felt for international companies. Just 21% of publicly announced startups in the winter 2023 batch are based internationally compared to 42% in the batch prior. Anyway, that is what is top of mind for me coming out of Demo Day. I always enjoy the two-day pitch-off because it gives us a glimpse of what is top priority for a whole slice of founders, some of whom are trying to put meat back in plant-based meat. Here are some of our pieces for further reading: In the rest of this newsletter we’re talking about horizontal verticals and data leaks. As always, you can follow me on Twitter or Instagram to continue the conversation. If you feel like supporting me extra, subscribe to my personal (and free!) Substack. Last week, a founder told me that “there’s too much opportunity” in Cerebral Valley, the new nickname for Hayes Valley as it gets overtaken with tech enthusiasts and builders in the AI space. I ended up writing a whole story about how people are riding the hype wave and trying their best not to fall off. Here’s another takeaway: The AI “boom” isn’t really just about startups building AI tools; it’s any startup that is trying to integrate AI — from Duolingo to a direct-to-consumer business — to stay competitive. As a result, investors don’t really need to invest in net new companies to get exposure to AI’s potential halo effect. If all your portfolio companies start to integrate with the right existing tools on the market, they could bloom too. It’s the promise of horizontal tech. Image Credits: Anthropic Image Credits: Anthropic On Equity this week, we spoke about a shocking data leak that TC’s Zack Whittaker broke: “Alcohol recovery startups Monument and Tempest shared patients’ private data with advertisers.” More than 100,000 patients are affected. Here’s what to know: Data shared with advertisers includes patient names, phone numbers, photo, unique digital ID, as well as “which services or plan the patient is using, appointment information and assessment and survey responses submitted by the patient, which includes detailed responses about a person’s alcohol consumption and used to determine their course of treatment.” The uniquely vulnerable customer base that Monument and Tempest both work with complicates the years-long leak even more. Like we said on the show, don’t ever leak data, but especially if you’re building this.

329,Warner Bros. in talks about a Harry Potter TV series for HBO Max,['@laurenforristal'],"April 4, 2023","Warner Bros. is in talks about a Harry Potter Max Original series on HBO Max, a source with knowledge of the matter confirmed to TechCrunch. The company is nowhere near striking a deal yet, the source tells us. Bloomberg was the first to report about the potential deal. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav and HBO chief Casey Bloys have apparently been trying to convince author J.K. Rowling to approve the series. Potterheads everywhere will likely be excited about a future series, being that Harry Potter is overall the best-selling book series, with over 600 million copies sold. In total, the eight films based on the series generated $7.7 billion in worldwide ticket sales. The Harry Potter brand has turned into many products and spinoffs, with the most recent being the video game Hogwarts Legacy, which Warner Bros. published in February and has sold more than 12 million copies so far. There’s also a stage production called “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” that had its official opening night on June 19, 2022. Warner Bros. has wanted to do more with the popular book series for a long time. The company previously said it would take “full advantage” of its IP, including Harry Potter, noted Zaslav during the Q4 2022 earnings call. “I believe that we have an overwhelming advantage in the marketplace with the IP that we own,” Zaslav said. “We have the strongest hand in the industry, with the most complete portfolio of assets and globally renowned franchises, personalities and storytelling IP across sports, news, nonfiction and entertainment, in virtually every region of the globe and in every language.” Other plans include new films based on The Lord of the Rings franchise, a prequel series for Stephen King’s “It,” and more “Game of Thrones” projects. WBD has also brought on filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran to reboot the DC Universe. Next week, the company will hold a press conference to announce its new streaming strategy, which will see a new streaming service that combines HBO Max and Discovery+ content.  "
330,Hampton is tech’s new membership community for chief executive officers,['@nmasc_'],"March 29, 2023","Sam Parr, founder of HubSpot-acquired newsletter and media brand The Hustle, doesn’t watch “Succession” because “it’s too real” (and because he prefers watching comedy compared to behemoth business billionaires fighting). But when he announced his new project, Hampton, an invite-only club for chief executive officers, the references started rolling. It’s specifically one Succession quote that sticks, in which much beloved and eternally tortured character Kendall Roy describes his and his siblings’ new media venture as: “It’s like a private members club, but for everyone.” Jokes aside, Parr’s vision for Hampton isn’t too far from that tagline. Hampton, built by Parr and media veteran Joe Speiser, wants to give high-growth executives a high-impact community to lean on, whether it’s through screen-sharing financials, or asking for advice because there’s only one month of runway left. And as SVB’s meltdown showed tech, a strong network can be a way of survival. The company has been in the works for around nine months and has landed more than 300 members, including Morning Brew’s Austin Rief, CB Insights’ Anand Sanwal, Fresh Clean Tees’ Melissa Parvis and Hootsuite’s Ryan Holmes. In order to join the community, Parr explains, members need to have succeeded in one of the following: built a company with $1 million in revenue, landed $3 million in funding or previously sold a business for at least $5 million. Then they are interviewed for culture fit and to confirm that they are building digital-first businesses. So far, half of the members are venture backed, half are bootstrapped. Those who are accepted have to sign a confidentiality agreement. Then, they are welcomed to a custom platform that has a member director, where you can see profiles, request intros and see a map where other members are located. The portal also has a vetted vendor list and an event calendar. Hampton members additionally are put onto a Slack for daily chatting, which is used by 85% of members. Members are placed into an eight-person group that meets once a month with an “executive facilitator,” which Parr describes as business therapy. Since leaving stealth yesterday, Hampton has landed over 3,000 new applications. “We’re not letting everyone in by the way, we’re very slowly and meticulously looking at who is a good fit,” Parr said. And for now, there’s only room for 400 more members before Hampton hits its cap. The co-founder says he took notes from YPO, Young Presidents’ Organization, and Vistage, a global executive coaching organization, when building Hampton. “Those are awesome, but a lot of those people may be someone who owns a plumbing company, or someone who inherited like five apartment buildings in South Florida,” he said. “They need their people, but our people aren’t exactly that people,” adding “No inherited businesses — you have to have started it and you have to be fairly aggressive about growth and personal growth.” If it sounds exclusive, it’s because it is (although Parr says that the name of the company is based on a street he lived near in Missouri, not the luxurious summer destination for the Upper East Side). Only 8% of applicants are accepted. Around 15% of members as of right now identify themselves as women, which is higher than some other community programs, but still shows a gap in diversity. One of Hampton’s closest competitors, Chief, actually built a business valued at over $1 billion to solve that gap. Chief is a private membership club for women in leadership positions. It only accepts women who identify as a “C-level executive, accomplished VP or equivalent executive leadership role within your organization,” and have an “established career with 15+ years of experience.” And it recently expanded to the U.K. Like Hampton, Chief has a waitlist that is greater than its acceptees. Parr thinks that Hampton is even more niche than Chief because instead of working with people across different leadership roles, it’s only working with chief executives and founders who have hit very specific growth milestones. Also unlike Chief, which has raised around $140 million in venture financing, Hampton isn’t raising a penny of outside capital. Parr built one of the fastest growing email newsletters at The Hustle, before reportedly selling it for around $27 million. He and his co-founder have pledged to invest up to seven figures of their own capital in the business, and as a result, they don’t need to turn to investors for starter capital. While he thinks Chief will work out, he expressed the stress that occurs when venture capital backs community startups. “Communities aren’t like a thing where you can just throw bodies at, you have to be very, very, very, very, careful,” Parr said. “I just didn’t want to have to grow like five times every year.” After the boom of community-oriented businesses in 2021, and the resulting sputter of some, there’s fatigue in the market on if a membership will provide value. I have spent years covering the networks that people in tech take to land their first check, job, promotion or “yes.” I’ve also seen how most community-focused companies all leap at the chance to go bigger — whether its accelerators growing their check size or simply the number of programs for entrepreneurs to go through.   Around five months ago, I wrote that it feels like we’re at an inflection point for the community-focused startup: double down on what you know and focus on discipline though this downturn. If Hampton sticks to its early messaging, its incentives do seem different from other clubs (or Clubhouse, even) in that it’s not viewing success as scaling through people. Parr is confident — they’ve only had to conduct two refunds for unhappy members — but he isn’t unaware of the market realities. “I don’t want to ruin my reputation and worst of all, if someone gives us their money we have to provide 10 times the value,” Parr said. “I am scared of that. I think that it will work. But it literally keeps me up all night.”"
331,Waymo retires its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan,['@kirstenkorosec'],"March 30, 2023","More than five years ago, a newly minted Waymo took the wraps off of what would become its first commercialized autonomous vehicle: a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan loaded with sensors and software. Now, the minivan, a symbol of the early and hypey AV days, is headed for retirement as Waymo transitions its fleet to the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles equipped with its fifth-generation self-driving system. When the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid AV was first revealed, it might not have been what people expected from the former Google self-driving project turned Alphabet-owned business. The design wasn’t ripped from the pages of a graphic sci-fi novel and it was hardly flashy. But the white minivan — highlighted with the same blue and green accent colors found on the Waymo logo — embodied the company’s aim. Waymo wanted a friendly looking vehicle people would feel comfortable using. The partnership with established manufacturer Fiat Chrysler — now Stellantis — also derisked an already risky frontier tech pursuit. Under the deal, Fiat Chrysler would handle the manufacturing and provide Waymo with minivans that built in redundancies designed for autonomous driving. Waymo never got close to the 62,000-minivan order it agreed to in 2018 as part of an expanded partnership with Fiat Chrysler. But the minivan did become a critical part of its commercialization plan and over its lifespan the fleet provided tens of thousands of rides to the public, according to the company. (Waymo has never revealed detailed figures of its minivan fleet beyond that its total global fleet is somewhere around 700 vehicles.) “It’s bittersweet to see it go,” Chris Ludwick, product management director at Waymo who has been at the company since 2012, told TechCrunch. “But I’m also happy for this next chapter.” Waymo revealed the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid in December 2016 and then provided more technical and business model details a month later at the 2017 North American International Auto Show. The first look at the minivan in December came just five days after Google’s self-driving project officially announced that it was a business with a new name and slightly tweaked mission. At the time, little was known about what the Google self-driving project — also known as Chauffeur — intended to do beyond a stated goal to commercialize self-driving cars. The Google self-driving project had developed a custom low-speed vehicle without a steering wheel called the Firefly, but that cute gumdrop-shaped car never made it to commercial robotaxi status. Waymo Firefly and Chrysler Pacifica autonomous vehicles. Image Credits: Waymo Waymo Firefly and Chrysler Pacifica autonomous vehicles. Image Credits: Waymo The lowly minivan seemed to represent a more grounded realistic vision toward the goal. By spring 2017, the company had launched an early rider program that let real people in the Phoenix area (who had been vetted and signed an NDA) use an app to hail a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan with a human safety operator behind the wheel. Waymo eventually opened up the service to the public — no NDA required — and grew its service area to Phoenix suburbs Chandler, Tempe, Ahwatukee and Mesa. Waymo repeated that process as it took the important step of removing the human safety operator from behind the wheel, launching driverless rides in 2019 and eventually a driverless robotaxi service in 2020 that was open to the public. Image Credits: Waymo Image Credits: Waymo The minivan’s initial reveal represented the moment when “Chauffeur” became Waymo and less of a science project, he noted. But there was still considerable work to be done. The Chrysler Pacifica was the ultimate commercial proving ground, according to anecdotes from Ludwick, who recounted the progress of moving from autonomous driving 10 miles in one day, then 100 miles, and then a 100 miles everyday. For instance, the company discovered that families were far more enthusiastic to use the minivan than it assumed. The minivan also helped develop the company’s AV operations playbook, including how to park vehicles in between rides and where to locate depots for maintenance and charging. The minivan also became a testbed for how to operate a driverless fleet during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to COVID, the fleet in Phoenix was a mix of driverless vehicles and those with human safety operators behind the wheel. “In three months we turned it fully driverless and figured out how to disinfect the vehicles between each ride,” he said. Image Credits: Waymo Image Credits: Waymo The next chapter for Waymo is focused on its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, which will be pulled into the service area in the Phoenix suburbs of Chandler and Tempe that the minivan covered. The Jaguar I-Pace is currently the go-to driverless vehicle for robotaxi rides in downtown Phoenix and to the Phoenix International Sky Harbor Airport. The 24/7 service runs on a five-mile stretch between downtown Phoenix and an airport shuttle stop, specifically, the 44th Street Sky Train station. On Thursday, the White House gave a shout-out to Waymo (along with other companies) for its commitment to an all-electric fleet as part of the White House EV Acceleration Challenge. Waymo intends to deploy the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace across all of its ride-hailing service territories this spring now that the minivan has been retired. The nod to Waymo was part of a larger announcement from the Biden administration around public and private sector investments into EVs as part of its goal of having 50% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. The next task for Waymo may be its most challenging: The company has to figure out how to grow the service, charge its all-electric fleet efficiently and eventually turn a profit. But Ludwick believes the company is well positioned thanks, in part, to the Chrysler Pacifica. “When I look at what the Pacifica got us, it’s a lot,” he said, noting that the vehicle had to travel at higher speeds and make unprotected left turns."
332,3 questions CISOs expect you to answer during a security pitch,"['Nancy Wang', 'Steve Zalewski']","May 2, 2023","It’s a difficult time to be a CISO or a security startup founder: Resources are tight and the stakes are high when deciding where to allocate them. This means the CISO deciding whether to onboard your product has less time, budget and staff than in recent years, and your pitch has to be that much better to make the cut. Working in your favor, the growing number of cyberattacks and exfiltration ransomware that continue to threaten the bottom line for enterprises, means security remains a business priority. Gartner predicts that end-user spending for the information security and risk management market will grow from $172.5 billion in 2022 to $267.3 billion in 2026, so opportunity remains plentiful. Just as security executives are condensing and refining their strategies, founders must do the same in the way they’re pitching these CISOs. There’s no more room for a good product winning over a CISO despite a bad pitch. Based on our more than four combined decades in computer engineering, cybersecurity, and security startup investment and advisory experience, these are the important questions we see smart security founders answering in their pitches over the next few months to close critical deals and adapt to the unique market conditions and industry landscape: In the industry we often hear about, “a solution looking for a problem,” when the onus is put on the CISO listening to your pitch to figure out what problem your product is trying to solve and why it’s critical to their business. While this may have worked in the past when there weren’t as many solutions, today it can be a deal breaker. With the increasing number of vendors now in the market, CISOs no longer have the time to do this work for you.
Just as security executives are refining their strategies, founders must do the same in the way they’re pitching these CISOs. A question Steve asked more than a hundred security vendors as the CISO at Levi Strauss was, “how does this solution sell more jeans?” In all too many cases, the answer was “we are here to help you find more vulnerabilities or identify more risks in your environment,” which lead to a quick “thank you, no thank you” response, since handing the CISO more issues is not helping sell more jeans or solving a problem. It showed a lack of understanding and demonstrated they simply wanted to sell another tool. When the response was along the lines of “our product will address the use case of identifying and remediating malicious or accidental misconfiguration of your consumer PII data in the cloud to limit the financial risk of regulatory fines and brand risk of violating consumer trust,” it demonstrated that they were thinking about the business problem and addressing how to accept responsibility for solving some facet(s) of it. Steve appreciated that they brought a solution to a business use case problem and it allowed him to quickly determine if this was “interesting” or “important” in the priority of problems he needed to solve in the next 6-18 months. It was also all too common when the “how do you sell more jeans” question was posed that the individual would just stop and stare, unprepared to answer, resulting again in a quick end to the discussion. Similar key questions to answer speaking to the bottom line include: Do you solve a business problem in a way that allows the CISO to consolidate their existing technology footprint?"
333,Thynk wants to upgrade hotel stays with a vertical software platform,['@romaindillet'],"April 13, 2023","Meet Thynk, a new company that wants to build the definitive enterprise software solution for the hospitality industry. The startup just raised a $13 million Series A round. This round was led by Singular, with a New York-based fund managed by Itai Tsiddon and Belgian investment firm CNP (Groupe Frère) also participating. Fly Ventures, an existing shareholder in the startup, invested once again. When it comes to software-as-a-service companies, entrepreneurs choose to address a specific segment. Some companies choose to focus on the long tail of small and medium companies because they often don’t have the right tools to do their job. For instance, in the hospitality industry, Amenitiz focuses exclusively on independent hotels and B&Bs. Thynk sits at the other end of the spectrum as it has been designed for hospitality companies that operate multiple properties and want to optimize their processes. “When I was thinking about starting a company again, I scanned the market and looked at different verticals to find a company that could reach $500 million in [annual recurring revenue],” co-founder and CEO Pascal Petit told me. More specifically, Petit was looking for an industry that could benefit from an enterprise software solution that could focus on three pillars — sales, operations and finance. Some inspiring companies include Veeva and nCino, two enterprise software companies focused on the pharmaceutical and banking industries, respectively. He landed on the hospitality industry because it generates $9 billion in revenue every year and it has been neglected. “This industry is completely under-equipped when it comes to integrated information systems. It is a sector that comes from asset management. Hospitality’s end goal is nothing more than a new way to generate income on real estate assets,” Petit said. Of course, when you arrive at a hotel, the receptionist is sitting in front of a computer. They mostly interact with a property management system (PMS). This system tells you which room is available and how much it costs to book another night. “These systems have been built around one building with a focus on [profit and loss],” Petit said. Essentially, when you check out, all the data that has been collected during your stay evaporates. And yet, hotels have changed quite a lot in recent years. In addition to hotel rooms, many hotels now have fancy restaurants, sophisticated cocktail bars, conference centers, coworking spaces, spas and various paid experiences. Thynk doesn’t want to replace property management systems. The startup believes that these systems will always be there to activate key cards, tell the hotel staff when a room needs to be cleaned and other tasks. Built on top of Salesforce’s stack, Thynk acts as a turnkey information system for hotel groups. First, it collects, cleans, centralizes and unifies customer data. Each client becomes a unique ID, which is a huge mental shift. Instead of focusing on rooms, Thynk focuses on clients — like a CRM. After that, data can be used for several internal processes — group booking, payment flows with deposits and pre-payments, proposal production and more. For instance, if a loyal customer wants to book a dozen rooms, but the hotel is full, the sales team can take over and recommend another hotel as it has a multi-property overview. And finally, Thynk can be used to actively reach out to customers with new offers, upselling opportunities and questions to improve a stay — everything you would expect from the customer success team. A product like Thynk makes sense in 2023 because a lot of hotel groups are trying to streamline their activities. Due to talent shortage, some support roles have been centralized by regions or countries. They need better tools as they are no longer in touch with hotel customers directly. Moreover, they work for several hotels at the same time. The startup has already signed contracts with a few hotel groups, such as Postillion in the Netherlands, Groupe Lucien Barrière in France and Design Hotels in Germany. In the United Arab Emirates, Thynk has started working with Rotana, a group with 65 hotels and 15,000 rooms. “They are using us as the core of their internal system, and because they are launching a franchise,” Petit said. And this is key to Thynk’s potential success. Once hospitality companies integrate the platform with their property management systems and centralize all data in Thynk, it becomes an integral part of the clients’ operations. “We are trying to replace the engine of the car, so the purchasing decision is very sticky,” Petit said."
334,"That slowdown you’re feeling, by the numbers",['@cookie'],"April 6, 2023","It’s more than a feeling. According to new data coming out from the research firm PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture firms are raising — and deploying — a lot less money than in recent years. What to know: Overall deal count in the U.S. has fallen more than 25% between the first quarter of last year and this year. Fewer than 3,000 deals were closed between the start of the year and the end of March, which doesn’t sound so terrible until you realize things haven’t been so slow, comparatively, since 2018 (see chart below). Late-stage deal value also dropped like a boulder in the first quarter. While it’s obvious from recent headlines that the era of the “mega round” has come and gone (for now), it’s something else to read that late-stage values have declined for the seventh straight quarter to $11.6 billion, according to PitchBook and the NVCA. The two say that just 19 late-stage mega rounds occurred in the first quarter of 2023, compared with a stunning 98 in Q1 2022. Unsurprisingly, that slowdown, or right-sizing, or whatever you prefer to call it, has had ripple effects. In the first quarter, per the organizations’ findings, the median late-stage, pre-money valuation fell 16.9% from the 2022 full-year figure to $54 million, while the average pre-money valuation declined by more than $100 million to $159 million. The industry is getting squeezed on all sides. According to the latest data, $11.7 billion was closed across 99 venture capital funds in the first quarter of this year — most of that money raised by larger-size vehicles and the lion’s share, seemingly, by NEA alone, which said in January that it closed on $6.2 billion in capital commitments across two new funds. Indeed, while just two venture funds closed on $1 billion or more in the first three months of this year, last year, 36 funds were closed with more than $1 billion in commitments. At the same time that they’re garnering less in the way of capital commitments, VCs’ portfolio companies are getting stuck in a kind of exit purgatory, too. According to the NVCA and PitchBook, just $5.8 billion in exit value was closed in the first quarter, which is apparently less than 1% of the total exit value generated in 2021 (it was a record year, but ouch). With the IPO window shut tight — there were only 20 public listings in the first quarter — “pressure continues to build within the ecosystem,” observes the authors of this latest “venture monitor” report. To learn more, stay tuned. Next week, the organizations are planning to drop a lot more data. In the meantime, if you want to take a look at some of these numbers yourself, you can find them here.

335,"Many canceled HBO shows, including ‘Westworld’ and ‘Raised by Wolves,’ are now on Roku",['@aiishamalik1'],"April 5, 2023","The Roku Channel has added 14 new free, ad-supported channels featuring TV shows and movies from Warner Bros.’s content library. Earlier this year, Warners Bros. Discovery announced that it reached a deal with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content. The content is now available on Roku. Roku’s new channels feature many popular titles, including HBO’s “Westworld,” “The Nevers” and “Raised by Wolves,” which were recently removed from the HBO Max library. HBO Max’s canceled reality shows, including “FBoy Island” and “Legendary” are also now available on Roku. The channels will also include “The Bachelor,” “Cake Boss,” “Say Yes to the Dress,” “The Nevers,” “Finding Magic Mike,” “Head of the Class,” “The Time Traveler’s Wife,” “My Cat from Hell,” “Breaking Amish,” “Caribbean Life,” “Paranormal Lockdown,” “Murder Chose Me,” “Mysteries at the Museum,” “A Wedding Story, “How It’s Made,” “My Five Wives” and more. The 14 new channels are called: WB TV All Together, WB TV At the Movies, WB TV Crime Scenes, WB TV Family Rules, WB TV How To, WB TV Keeping it Real, WB TV Love & Marriage, WB TV Mysteries, WB TV Paws & Claws, WB TV Slice of Life, WB TV Supernatural, WB TV Sweet Escapes, WB TV Watchlist and WB TV Welcome Home. The new channels bring Roku Channel’s selection of free live streaming channels to over 450. The deal from earlier this year marked a turn for Warner Bros. Discovery, which used to keep its movies and TV shows for HBO Max. Now, the company is licensing its content to third parties. Today’s news comes as Warner Bros.’s upcoming combined HBO Max/Discovery+ streaming service is expected to launch this spring. Following its debut in the United States, the service will roll out in Latin America and then in Europe in 2024. While the company has yet to announce how much the service will cost or what it’ll be called, it will get an ad-free and ad-lite plan.  "
336,Google launches the first public beta of Android 14,['@fredericl'],"April 12, 2023","Google’s Android development cycle runs on a rather predictable cadence these days. Today, after two developer previews, the company launched the first of four planned public beta releases of Android 14. As with previous versions, the first beta is also the first release that anyone can install over-the-air, assuming they have a supported Pixel device, going back to the Pixel 4a 5G (but not the Pixel 4). There’s no official support for non-Google phones yet. As always, keep in mind that these are betas for a reason and still mostly meant for developers who want to test their apps against this new version and early adopters who just can’t wait for the stable release. Things can — and will — break. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google For the most part, there aren’t many new features in this beta version, though there are two user-facing UI updates worth calling out. The first is a new back arrow (yes — we’ve reached the point in mobile OS history where new back arrows are pretty much the most exciting thing). As Google notes, the gesture navigation experience now “includes a more prominent back arrow while interacting with an app to help improve back gesture understanding and usefulness.” This arrow will match your wallpaper or device theme. Exciting stuff. Developers will now also be able to add custom actions to the system sharesheet, and the sharesheet will now be smarter about how it ranks your sharing targets. Otherwise, there isn’t all that much new here. Per-app language settings are here, as are Google’s previously announced new privacy settings. I expect we’ll hear a bit more about what’s new in Android 14 — and see more user-facing features — at Google I/O next month. For now, though, this appears to be another evolutionary release.

337,Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes isn’t headed to jail tomorrow after all,['@cookie'],"April 26, 2023","Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes will not be heading off to prison tomorrow to begin serving an 11-year sentence, as first reported by the WSJ. Though earlier this month U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila denied her request to remain free while she appeals her conviction, this week she asked the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals directly if she could stay out of prison while her case makes its way through the appeals process; the request automatically puts her reporting date on hold while the court considers her request, says the Journal. It’s just the latest twist in a Silicon Valley story that has captivated the broader business world and even led to an Emmy-award-winning limited series called “The Dropout” on Hulu. In January 2022, following a nearly four-month trial, Holmes was convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy related to Theranos, her failed blood-testing startup. At her sentencing hearing in November of last year, Judge Davila ordered her to “surrender” on April 27, 2023. In denying Holmes’s earlier request to remain free while she appeals her conviction, Judge Davila wrote that while Holmes presented “clear and convincing evidence that she would not flee,” he did not believe she raised a “substantial question of law or fact” likely to result in “reversal or an order for a new trial of all counts.” Theranos’ former president and COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani — who was also found guilty last year of defrauding the company’s investors and its patients — had similarly asked the Ninth Circuit if he could remain free while he contests his conviction. His bid was rejected three weeks later, but the move enabled him to push his own surrender to a low-security prison facility in San Pedro, California, from mid-March to last Thursday, April 20. It isn’t clear whether it will have any impact, but on Monday, an association for criminal defense lawyers urged the Ninth Circuit to order a new trial for Holmes, saying prosecutors skirted procedure rules by disclosing the identity of a witness — Kingshuk Das, a former clinical lab director at Theranos — just five weeks before the government’s opening arguments in the trial. They argue the move was a violation of Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which aims to give defendants sufficient time to prepare their defense. Holmes has two children under the age of two. Before this latest development, she was set to turn herself over the U.S. Marshal’s Office, and then be transferred to a federal prison facility. The court reportedly recommended the Federal Prison Camp at Bryan, Texas, about 100 miles outside of Houston, where Holmes grew up in part and where she continues to have family. According to the Houston Chronicle, the minimum-security facility has dormitory housing for its roughly 550 inmates, has a low staff-to-inmate ratio, and is “work- and program-oriented,” per the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford in 2003 to build Theranos, was widely celebrated by the business press for developing a technology that she said could test for hundreds of conditions with just a pinprick of blood. Investors also believed Holmes’s claims, providing more than $400 million of funding to the company and assigning it a valuation of $9 billion. That narrative began to break apart in 2015, after a series of WSJ articles revealed that its technology did not work as advertised. In June 2018, Holmes and Balwani were both indicted on criminal fraud charges; soon after, the company announced to shareholders that it would formally dissolve."
338,"The shocking allegations against Daylight, an LGBTQ+ focused fintech startup",['@bayareawriter'],"April 2, 2023","Welcome to The Interchange! If you received this in your inbox, thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you’re reading this as a post on our site, sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week, I’ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s my job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know. — Mary Ann Last week ended with an explosive feature published by NY Magazine. The article homed in on Daylight, an LGBQT+ focused neobank whose seed and Series A fundraises TechCrunch had covered here and here, respectively. The depiction of CEO and founder Rob Curtis was so far from the polite executive that I interviewed that it made me question my own character judgment. Lawsuits, fabrications and inappropriate behavior are among the many allegations reported in this in-depth piece. One person who tried the bank’s service shared with me that other than being allowed to use their chosen name on a card, they “didn’t really see much in the way of benefits or specialization” and that it was “so buggy,” they stopped using it. Meanwhile, there is never a dull day in the corporate spend space. Last week, I wrote about Ramp reporting 4x revenue growth in 2022. That got me curious about other companies in the space, so I pinged a few of them. An Airbase spokesperson got back to me, sharing via email: “We grew 2X across the important dimensions of ARR, payment volume and number of paying customers. It’s important to point out that the majority of our revenue is high-margin and subscription based, unlike most of the interchange revenue focused companies in our space. We choose not to play the gross ARR obfuscation game…” Ouch. Meanwhile, I neglected to include last week that Brex had expanded into the travel space. That company has reportedly ruffled a few feathers, though, as of late, according to AwardWallet, by devaluing “cash and crypto redemptions by 40% and slashed Brex Rewards point transfer rates to airline partners by over 40%” with little to no notice. Twitter was also abuzz about the news, if this tweet is any indication. I did reach out to the company, but have not yet heard back. Reports Haje Jan Kamps: “What do you do when you have a very successful and popular product (marijuana) that is legal in some places, but federally has been a Schedule 1 drug since 1970? Well, you can’t rely on any national institutions as your business partners. One of the major places that shows up is in payments and payment processing; even after recreational cannabis became legal in 21 states and decriminalized in another dozen or so, cannabis has become largely a cash business. In a world that is increasingly cashless, that’s a problem for both consumers and businesses. Smoakland is currently beta-testing a loophole that lets its customers pay by credit card. The secret, it turns out, is crypto.” More here. Reports Anna Heim: “If you think embedded insurance is the only hot thing in insurtech these days, we’ve got a surprise in store for you: While it’s true that startups that help sell insurance together with other products and services are enjoying tailwinds, there are plenty of other opportunities in the space, several investors told TechCrunch+.” More here. I reached out to payment company Checkout.com’s new president, Céline Dufétel, to find out more about her plans in her new role, including what’s in store for the company this year, her thoughts on the future of payments generally and why she sees so much opportunity in the U.S. We also asked how she felt about the comparisons to Stripe…and her answer may surprise you. More here. Reports Kyle Wiggers: “Confluent co-founder Neha Narkhede today announced a new fintech company, Oscilar, that’s developing an ‘AI-driven’ platform to help financial institutions protect online transactions from fraud and theft. Oscilar is entirely self-funded, backed by $20 million that Narkhede and the company’s other co-founder, Sachin Kulkarni, themselves contributed. Narkhede says they opted not to take outside funding so that they could ‘quickly build and scale the company as it launches publicly.” More here. Reports Kyle Wiggers: Months after unveiling a “major update to Apple Pay called Apple Pay Later, which allows users to split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase into four equal payments over six weeks without interest or late fees, Apple has finally launched the feature. But not for everyone — at least not yet. Starting today, Apple says it’ll begin inviting randomly selected users to access a pre-release version of Apple Pay Later, with plans to offer it to all ‘eligible’ users on iOS 16.4 or iPadOS 16.4 in the coming months.” Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings weighed in on the Apple Pay Later news, with senior director Michael Taiano noting via email that “Apple not allowing customers to link to a credit card is a unique feature in its BNPL product that should limit the ability of borrowers to pay off one form of debt with another form of debt, though it does not fully address our broader concerns over the structural and cyclical challenges the buy-now-pay-later business model continues to face.” Tage Kene-Okafor conducted an in-depth interview with Union54 co-founder and CEO Perseus Mlambo in which the executive “spoke candidly about the issues Union54 had to contend with when it had to halt operations over an attempted $1.2 billion chargeback fraud last year, how the company was at risk of a total shutdown, and why fintechs need to be more transparent about fraud exposure.” A must read! Reports Fintech Futures: “Payments giants Visa and Mastercard are reportedly among a number of firms competing to acquire Brazilian payment and banking platform Pismo. News reports state that the firm is working with Goldman Sachs on a potential sale at a reported valuation of $1 billion. Sources tell Bloomberg that other interested parties include a bank and a private equity firm, and that the talks may not result in a sale. According to Valor Economico’s Pipeline, Visa submitted an initial offer of $1 billion which was rejected by Pismo, following which Visa upped its bid to $1.4 billion.” More here. TechCrunch covered Pismo’s $108 million raise in October of 2021. If true, this is super exciting news not only for Pismo, but also for the Latin American startup scene as a whole. Speaking of Latin America, Latitud, a self-described “tech entrepreneurship program” for the Latin American region that is backed by Andreessen Horowitz and NFX, “launched business accounts.” According to co-founder Brian Requarth, the move was made in part because “most all founders in LatAm worked with SVB. . . . There is a gaping hole,” he said via email. “We had been working on this for months so we decided to launch it.” TechCrunch covered Latitud’s raise last March. Aspiration filed a WARN notice in Oregon on March 24, 2023, notifying the state that it plans to lay off 180 people sometime between May 26, 2023, and June 1, 2023. Among those impacted are the chief administration officer, president of the MENA region, and vice presidents of business development, HR and product design. As one source shared, Aspiration had planned to become a public company but has yet to iron out its SPAC. The SPAC requested an extension until June 9 to complete the merger. Notably, according to its website, it has “pivoted to selling carbon credits to businesses instead of the environmentally friendly neobank most people might know them as,” the source said. TechCrunch reached out to Aspiration but did not get a response. The company has raised about $250 million in known funding.

339,"No, you’re not raising money to increase your runway",['@Haje'],"April 16, 2023","I often hear founders say they are raising money to increase their runway by 18 to 24 months. In a sense, that is accurate, but only from the startup’s point of view. However, that’s not what an investor is looking for. Your company surviving for another year and a half is not the goal of a fundraise; that’s a side effect at best. It’s probably a decent guess for how long the next stage of the company will take, but only because 18 to 24 months is typically the time horizon you can semi-reliably predict. But what happens at the end of those 18 months? Instead, founders should communicate to investors what a round of funding unlocks. That’s expressed in milestones, not in time. The goal is to transform the company sufficiently that you can do something that you cannot do at this moment. How do you know how much money you need to raise? It’s a tricky question, but it’s a critical aspect of your startup journey. Establishing a clear and realistic fundraising target requires careful consideration with one goal in mind: What hoops do you need to jump through in order to be able to raise your next round of funding.

340,Google disrupts malware that steals sensitive data from Chrome users,['@carlypage_'],"April 26, 2023","Google has disrupted infrastructure linked to the notorious CryptBot malware, which the company claims has stolen data from hundreds of thousands of browser users in the past year alone. CryptBot is malicious information-stealing malware first discovered in 2019. The infostealer malware is typically distributed by spoofed websites masquerading as legitimate software sites that offer free downloads. Once installed, the malware steals sensitive information from infected computers, like passwords, cookies, cryptocurrency wallets and credit card information. In a blog post, Google said it observed the malware spreading by way of maliciously modified apps, including Google Chrome and Google Earth Pro. In the last 12 months, Google says the malware compromised about 670,000 computers in order to steal sensitive information that’s “eventually sold to bad actors to use in data breach campaigns.” Google said it tracked recent CryptBot versions impersonating its browser and mapping software, worked to identify the malware’s Pakistan-based distributors, and took action. After filing a legal complaint against several of CryptBot’s major distributors, the tech giant confirmed Wednesday that it had secured a temporary court order to hamper the developers’ ability to spread the infostealer malware. The order, granted by a federal judge in the Southern District of New York, allows Google to take down current and future domains that are linked to the distribution of the CryptBot malware. “This will slow new infections from occurring and decelerate the growth of CryptBot,” the technology giant said in a blog post. “Lawsuits have the effect of establishing both legal precedent and putting those profiting, and others who are in the same criminal ecosystem, under scrutiny. This litigation is another step forward in holding cybercriminals accountable, by not just targeting those that operate botnets, but also those that profit from malware distribution.” Google’s disruption of CryptBot comes after the company took legal action in 2021 against the two alleged operators of the Russia-based Glupteba botnet, which the company said was used to steal Google users’ logins and account information. As a result of its disruption efforts, Google said it observed a 78% reduction in Glupteba infections.  "
341,"Bob Lee, creator of Cash App and former CTO of Square, stabbed to death",['@romaindillet'],"April 5, 2023","Bob Lee, the chief product officer at MobileCoin, was killed in a fatal stabbing in San Francisco. On Tuesday morning, at 2:35 a.m., the San Francisco Police Department responded to a report of a stabbing near the 300 block of Main Street in SoMa. He was taken to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries. Shortly after, NBC Bay Area reported that the victim of the stabbing was Bob Lee, 43. MobileCoin confirmed the information in a statement sent to Bloomberg and ABC7 News. Before joining MobileCoin, Bob Lee worked at Google for the first few years of Android, focusing on core library development. He then joined Square, the payment company that later became Block, to develop its Android app. He became the company’s first CTO and also created Cash App. Bob Lee, also known as ‘Crazy Bob,’ was an investor in tech startups as well. According to his LinkedIn profile, he invested in SpaceX, Clubhouse, Tile, Figma, Faire, Orchid, Addressable, Nana, Ticket Fairy, Gowalla, Asha, SiPhox, Netswitch, Found and others. Following the news, there was an outpouring of grief in the tech community. “It’s real. Getting calls. Heartbreaking. Bob was instrumental to Square and Cash App. STL guy,” Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Block, wrote on nostr. “So sad to hear of @crazybob’s untimely passing. I first met him in summer 2006 — he didn’t care that I was only 14 and we talked tech / geeked out about programming. We remained connected over the years and he was an early supporter of Figma. It’s so hard to believe he is gone,” Figma CEO Dylan Field wrote on Twitter. “What a tragedy. I remember Bob’s code that generates certain numbers. Bob’s code is in Java, yet uses clever backtracking techniques to achieve the best performance among many solutions in all kinds of languages,” hintymad wrote on Hacker News.

342,Netflix earmarks $2.5B for original content in South Korea,['@kateparknews'],"April 25, 2023","After the stunning success of “Squid Game” in 2021, Netflix is doubling down on South Korea in hopes of another home run out of the country’s entertainment industry. The U.S. streaming giant said Tuesday that it plans to invest $2.5 billion in South Korea over the next four years to produce TV series, movies and reality shows out of the country, both for Korean audiences but also to export across its wider global footprint. The announcement was made to coincide with a meeting between South Korean President Yoon SukYeol — who is making a state visit to the U.S. — and Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in Washington. “We were able to make this decision because we have great confidence that the Korean creative industry will continue to tell great stories,” Sarandos said in a speech Monday. “We were also inspired by the president’s love and strong support for the Korean entertainment industry and fueling the Korean wave.” South Korean entertainment, from music through to film and TV, has proven to be a huge hit with audiences further afield. Squid Game was one of Netflix’s most successful forays into original content to date, with viewers from across 142 million households globally; even two years on from its debut, it remains one of its most popular series of all time. In Korea itself, the show’s popularity was so high that it earned Netflix the dubious distinction of picking up a lawsuit from one of the country’s biggest broadband providers for the spike in traffic (and subsequent related costs). “Squid Game” is not alone when it comes to TV shows that resonate with larger, global audiences. Others include “The Glory,” and the reality show “Physical: 100,” which earlier this year became one of the most-watched in non-English language shows globally. Netflix has introduced more than 80 Korean films and series and “spent about $700 million on Korean content” between the years 2015 and 2020, according to Netflix’s VP of Public Policy, Dean Garfield, speaking in Seoul during his visit to South Korea in 2021. The $2.5 billion commitment, if followed through, will average out to $625 million annually for the next four years, a bump up on Netflix’s previous budget. In 2021, the U.S. streaming behemoth committed $500 million to produce original movies and TV shows in South Korea. Like other regions worldwide, in Asia, Netflix competes with peers such as Amazon, Disney, Hulu and Apple TV as well as a host of more regional players across the 190 countries where it currently operates. Netflix’s shift to original content comes at a time when a number of its competitors are pulling titles away from Netflix to boost their own services. This, in turn, has led Netflix to focus even more on original content and a host of other approaches — including ad-supported free usage and launching games — to attract more users and usage. The ad-supported tier is not only meant to build out its user numbers enticed by the allure of free services but to attract a new revenue stream in the form of ad sales. Launched in November last year, the company now offers Basic with Ad services in the U.S., Europe (the U.K., France, Germany and Italy) and Asia (Japan, Australia and South Korea). Indeed, Netflix is offering plenty of carrots, but also sticks, to improving its revenues and profit margins. Last week, Netflix said it plans to crack down on password sharing starting in the coming months."
343,"Senate Banking chair urges FDIC to look into Tellus, a fintech backed by Andreessen Horowitz",['@bayareawriter'],"May 4, 2023","Tellus, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed fintech company that claims it can offer people higher yields on their savings balances by using that money to fund certain U.S. single-family-home loans, is under scrutiny by the U.S. government. On May 2, as first reported by Barron’s, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, wrote a letter to FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg expressing concerns about Tellus’s claims. In that letter, Brown pressed the FDIC to review Tellus’s business practices “to ensure that customers are protected from financial fraud and abuse.” He said an article published early last month by Barron’s raised “several red flags.” Brown also wrote to Tellus’s CEO and Chief Technology Officer Jeromee Johnson outlining his concerns and requested more information on their business practices. Like the majority of fintech startups, Tellus is not actually a bank but instead partners with banks to offer banking services to consumers. While the company was founded in 2016, it only emerged from stealth last year after raising $16 million in seed funding last year led by Andreessen Horowitz. According to Barron’s (which cited records filed in Santa Clara County, California), an Andreessen Horowitz general partner, Connie Chan, earlier wed Tellus co-founder Rocky Lee. She filed a marriage dissolution/divorce lawsuit in 2021. It is not clear if the pair is still married. It is also unclear which partner from a16z led the round. Tellus’s business model is unique, and risky. It targets existing home owners who wish to upgrade to larger homes without selling the homes they live in, which makes it difficult for them to receive approval for loans by traditional mortgage lenders. Last November, Lee told TechCrunch that Tellus’s interest rates are typically 200 basis points higher than the standard conforming mortgage. For example, in today’s market if a loan’s rate is 7%, Tellus will charge 9% — a premium because it claims it’s offering to lend money to American single-family-home borrowers “in prime cities” who would otherwise not be able to get such loans. Because it is using its retail customers’ savings deposits to fund these loans at a higher yield, Tellus makes its money on the spread of what it’s paying out in interest versus what it’s charging its borrowers. The model is exactly what has Brown concerned. If home owners default on those loans, then customers’ deposits are at risk. When TechCrunch probed Lee on that point last year, he claimed that Tellus utilizes “very strict underwriting criteria” and had not yet seen any defaults because the majority of its borrowers “go on to soon after refinance their loans at more favorable terms.” In that earlier conversation with TechCrunch, Lee said Tellus had lent out more than $80 million with an average loan size of $2 million since its 2016 inception (Barron’s recently reported that the figure was now $100 million, according to industry tracker Attom). Lee also said the company partners with mortgage brokers to find borrowers, and that it finds its retail clients via channels such as Instagram, TikTok and Google. In his letter, Brown wrote: “Although Tellus claims that it is not a bank, a fact its website repeatedly reminds customers of, I am concerned that Tellus’s practice of marketing high-interest deposits to fund real estate loans may give consumers the false impression that their money is as safe as a deposit at an FDIC-insured bank. I urge the FDIC to take a closer look at Tellus and its operations.” He also pointed out that Tellus does most of its real estate lending in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region where property values have been declining. He added: “This downswing may pose increased risks to Tellus depositors if Tellus borrowers default on their loans.” Brown also pointed out that while Tellus touted partnerships with FDIC-insured banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, it turns out those relationships “did not exist.” Indeed, when Barron’s talked with both banks about the company’s claims toward that end, they expressed surprise, reported Barron’s.  “Wells Fargo does not have the relationship that’s described on Tellus’s website,” the company said in a statement to Barron’s. “We are working with Tellus to update the language on their website, and remove our company’s name.” Wells Fargo said it also disagrees with the description of itself as a “banking partner.” JPMorgan told Barron’s it does “not have a banking or custodial relationship with the company.” Barron’s published its investigative piece about Tellus on April 11. On the FAQ section of Tellus’s website, the company posted an update on April 26, saying: “Tellus is not a bank, and your Tellus accounts are not FDIC insured. All of our cash is held at leading banks, each member FDIC insured. We keep this cash at different banks to ensure you always have access to your money, even if there’s a problem with one of these banks. Once we lend money, that cash is considered ‘deployed.’ Deployed cash acts as a loan, meaning it’s a real estate loan itself and has no FDIC insurance. These loans are not mortgage-backed securities, as Tellus holds no mortgage-backed securities.” In general, there has been widespread panic about accounts that are not FDIC-insured, leading people to withdraw billions of dollars from regional banks since mid-March to protect their assets and to the shutdowns of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank. TechCrunch reached out to Tellus and Andreessen Horowitz, neither of which had responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. (Update 5/5: Tellus CEO and CTO Jeromee Johnson provided this written statement to TechCrunch: “I have received the request for information from Senator Brown. We are also aware of the Barron’s article that prompted the Senator’s concern. While many of the facts in that article are true, we strongly disagree with his portrayal of our business as misleading or unduly risky. Tellus is a startup that is on a mission to improve the financial health of American consumers. We are grateful for – and share – the Senator’s concern for the well being of our customers. I and Tellus will be cooperating fully with the request for information.”) Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here. Got a news tip or inside information about a topic we covered?

344,Neato Robotics is being shut down after 18 years,['@bheater'],"May 1, 2023","In many meaningful ways, the robot vacuum has been a true success story. The category is broadly considered to be the first mainstream home robot — and 21 years after the first Roomba went on sale, it continues to stand alone. It did one job, and it largely did it well. It was repeatable, the system is affordable and the technology has continued to improve while the core product remains the same. Founded in 2005 by a trio of Stanford alums, Neato Robotics has been along for most of that ride. The Bay Area firm rose quickly, becoming one of iRobot’s primary competitors years before every single consumer electronics firm took a crack at the space. Over that time, Neato attracted its own unique fanbase by on-boarding new innovations, like its 2011 introduction of Wi-Fi connectivity. Five years ago this September, Neato was purchased by Vorwerk. The two had partnered years prior, bringing the robot vacuums to the appliance firm’s native Germany. Vorwerk promised to keep the brand largely independent. Late last week, however, Neato’s parent firm confirmed that it is shutting down the brand, due to underperformance. Vorwerk says the closure is not from lack of trying, telling TechHive that Neato is “now being closed down despite lots of restructuring effort,” because it hasn’t “achieved its self-defined economic goals for several years now.” Nearly 100 Neato employees are being impacted by the move, while a significantly smaller team in Milan will remain on-board to support those systems that are already out in the world. Vorwerk says the move is part of a 2025 restructuring strategy, which will find it continuing to focus on vacuums and other robotics at its German offices. The company notes [run through Google translate]: The consolidation of Vorwerk also affects the stake in the US company Neato Robotics, which has been 100 percent owned by the Vorwerk Group since 2017. Neato has brought valuable experience and innovations to Vorwerk’s product development in the field of cleaning robots over the past few years. However, Neato’s independent sales in e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail with a focus on the USA has not been able to be successfully developed, so that the company has not achieved the economic goals it has set itself for several years. Vorwerk says its team will continue to support existing Neato products for the next five years."
345,Blue Origin releases report on launch anomaly and plans to fly again ‘soon’,['@techcrunch'],"March 24, 2023","It’s been nearly six months since Blue Origin’s 23rd suborbital launch experienced an anomaly, and the company has finally released the results of its investigation. The good news is the escape function worked great! But there was definitely a nozzle problem. The September flight, NS-23, was carrying a number of science payloads and no space tourists (let alone billionaires), so fortunately there was never anyone in danger. The anomaly occurred in the first ascent stage, triggering the abort process. The capsule separated from the propulsion module and deployed its parachutes, while the rocket fell to the ground. Unfortunately this meant that the investigators had to reassemble the rocket to figure out what happened: Forensic evaluation of the recovered nozzle fragments also showed clear evidence of thermal damage and hot streaks resulting from increased operating temperatures. The fatigue location on the flight nozzle is aligned with a persistent hot streak identified during the investigation. The nozzle is the cone-shaped bit at the end of the rocket that contains and shapes the thrust. Naturally it has to be extremely heat-tolerant, but even a rocket nozzle has its limits. According to the Blue Origin investigators, “changes made to the engine’s boundary layer cooling system” led to higher temperatures and produced a persistent hot streak on this nozzle, eventually causing the thrust coming from that engine to differ from the rest. That mismatch triggered the escape system. A piece of the engine nozzle identified by the team. Image Credits: Blue Origin A piece of the engine nozzle identified by the team. Image Credits: Blue Origin I’ve asked Blue Origin for more information, specifically how long that design change (and the resultant hot streaks) were in use, and will update this post if I hear back from them. Returning to flight after an anomaly is a complicated process, but Blue Origin has been staying ready by applying for rolling launch window permissions with the FCC, and today this investigation report (in full detail, not the short version) has been submitted to the Federal Aviation Authority. That’s the agency that ultimately decides when the company can fly again, but the timeline for evaluating the report is up to them. The company, for its part, merely said it expects to fly again “soon” — and the payloads that had their trip interrupted in September will be the first to go up."
346,Lucid Air Touring review: Some reservations,['@abigailbassett'],"April 13, 2023","The battle for market share in the luxury EV sector is heating up, leaving customers with more choice than ever before. That’s great news for consumers and a pressure cooker for EV makers hoping to carve out market share. The latest entry to this competitive luxury EV landscape is the Lucid Air Touring sedan, a five-passenger sedan that gets an EPA-estimated 384 miles of all-electric range that sits below the Lucid Air Grand Touring sedan and above its entry-level Pure model. Is the middle-of-the-pack Lucid Air, enough to upend the big players? After a week of tooling around the wet spring roads in Southern California in the new $120,000+ Lucid Air Touring, I was left with a few reservations. This was not my first time in the driver’s seat of a Lucid Air. I drove one of the first few Lucid Air Dream sedans off the production line in Casa Grande, Arizona, in September of 2021. During that drive along a flat, fast route that took me along an Arizona highway, I was impressed with its quickness, seemingly advanced tech, capabilities and speed. I expected no less in the slightly lighter, lower-range Touring model. And while there were plenty of things that still impressed me, a few features, including the Amazon Alexa voice assistant and driver assistance, left me disappointed. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Image Credits: Abigail Bassett The Lucid Air Touring is more of a sleeper luxury vehicle than an attention grabber. Almost all of the vehicles I test drive get some kind of public response when I’m out and about, yet, surprisingly — and in spite of its sleek spaceship styling — the Lucid Air Touring did not. That isn’t to say the Touring doesn’t have a few eye-catching design features, notably the optional full-glass roof with its brushed metal c-pillar and its distinctive wide nose with a brushed metal frunk detail and wide lighting signature. The Lucid Air Touring’s low profile, which includes a short rear deck and long swooping hood, has helped the model secure the lowest drag of any production vehicle on the market, at least according to the company. The Air gets a 0.197 coefficient of drag, which slots it below the Mercedes EQE sedan and Tesla’s Model S, which get a drag coefficient of 0.200 and 0.208, respectively. That low drag, combined with its battery pack and efficient electric motors, helps the Touring achieve that EPA range that’s just shy of 400 miles. Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Image Credits: Abigail Bassett Lucid has taken a page from Tesla’s book, eliminating nearly all the buttons inside the sedan and relying on a pair of large touchscreens for everything from climate to car settings. The lack of physical buttons offers a clean look at a cost. Need to change the position of the steering wheel or wing mirrors? You’ll need to do that through the infotainment touchscreen. Want to open the glovebox or kick the Lucid Air Touring into one of its other drive modes? Find the icons on the infotainment screen. Hunting for icons is far from ideal while driving, but it is possible to get used to the process. Image Credits: Lucid Image Credits: Lucid That dual-screen layout does have its advantages. Users can swipe content from the upper wing-like display that stretches from the driver’s side to middle of the vehicle, down to the infotainment display. While it does reset when you turn the car off, it’s a nice feature if you want to rearrange where your mapping, radio station or drive control details are. There are a couple of small switches that you can nudge up or down, at the center of the dash, immediately above the infotainment screen. These act as quick temperature and fan controls. There is also a small, grooved cylinder in the center that acts as a volume control for the optional Dolby Atmos sound system that my test car came with. The only buttons in the entire interior sit on the two grooved cylinders on the steering wheel. These control the advanced adaptive cruise control system and the following distance (more on that below) as well as a few features on the infotainment system. Image Credits: Lucid Image Credits: Lucid While that giant sunroof is a head-turning exterior detail, it also happens to be a bit of a head-baking feature on the inside. I took the Touring out for a 230-mile run down toward Temecula on a Sunday when the temperatures climbed toward the high 70s and low 80s in some of the drier, less forested areas. While the glass roof is treated to cut down on UV and heat issues inside the cabin, there’s no physical shade to cover it. Because the windshield blends seamlessly into the roof, standard opaque sun visors offer the only respite. It did get rather warm on my drive, and there was nothing to do but crank the AC a bit higher. At the same time, that glass roof, combined with the low floor of the vehicle, gives the interior an open and almost cavernous feeling, which is quite nice, especially on a long drive. Under the floor in the Lucid Air Touring sits a 92-kWh battery pack. That’s the key difference between the more expensive and longer-range Grand Touring, which gets a larger 112-kWh battery pack, giving it more range. Because Lucid essentially removed a few battery cells from the floor, rear passengers get slightly deeper footwells. The technology inside the Lucid Air Touring is both impressive and, yet, simultaneously unperfected. However, it should be noted that since my test drive Lucid has made one critical improvement to its infotainment offerings by rolling out Apple CarPlay to every Lucid via an over-the-air software update. My biggest frustration was using the Amazon Alexa voice assistant to control features like navigation and temperature control. Point blank, Alexa is atrocious as an in-car system. I’ve used it in other EVs like the Rivian R1S and hated it equally, and it’s no better in the Lucid Air Touring. I used Alexa to navigate to a few locations around Temecula once I arrived. Despite speaking clearly and slowly, Alexa repeatedly failed to understand my destination. I became so frustrated with the system that I gave up yelling at it and pulled off the road to manually put the destination in through the infotainment touchscreen. I also spent about an hour without SiriusXM reception, even though I was in clear view of the sky for the duration of my trip. It took cycling the car on and off to get it to come back. In addition to almost useless voice recognition, Alexa’s mapping is far inferior to Google, MapBox or other systems that other OEMs use for their onboard mapping. Alexa was so awful that it put me on a dirt road to get to the city of Pala Mesa, a location that Google showed had plenty of paved roads. Image Credits: Lucid Image Credits: Lucid My test vehicle had Lucid’s DreamDrive Pro, which includes “future-ready semi-autonomous driving functionality,” and surround view monitoring with blind-spot display. To activate the system, the driver uses the cylinders and buttons on the steering wheel to set speed and following distance. On fast-moving highways, the system behaves as expected, keeping a respectful following distance and maintaining speed, slowing down to a stop, and speeding back up as any reasonable human driver would. When the adaptive cruise is disengaged, however, the aggressive brake regeneration kicks in and starts to slow the car quickly. That can be problematic in 70 miles-per-hour traffic, and it’s not completely clear when the system is engaged versus when it isn’t. The icon that appears on the driver’s display is small and easy to miss if you’re trying to negotiate a lane change at speed. The lane-keeping and departure assistant leaves a lot to be desired, too. The system tends to want to keep the sedan right up against the right line, which can be hairy when passing a semi-truck or when you live in California, where it’s legal for motorcycles to lane split. The lane-keeping also has an odd sticking behavior when you try to break it away from its right-justified habits. Say you want to make space for a motorcycle that’s splitting lanes in traffic, and you’re using the lane-keeping and departure systems. You have to tug the wheel through what feels like a sticky spot (almost like it freezes) to get the car to respond and move over. That results in more steering input that causes the driver to have to correct to get back to the middle of the lane. After fighting the system, I finally abandoned the system altogether. Finally, there’s the distracted driver warning. It’s a valuable tool designed to keep driver’s eyes on the road. But it is so sensitive that I received alerts even when I briefly looked through the passenger side window to check my blind spot. Image Credits: Lucid Image Credits: Lucid On the road, however, the Lucid Air excels. It’s quiet inside, and despite its size, the vehicle is surprisingly easy to wheel on single-lane winding roads. Plus, when you roll down the windows to take in the lovely weather it’s nearly silent outside, as well. Range is where the Lucid Air Touring truly shines, however. That tremendous EPA-rated 384 miles of range takes real effort to deplete. When you do have to plug in on a road trip, hit the battery preconditioning icon on the infotainment screen and put in an Electrify America DC fast charger nearby, and you can regain as much as 300 miles of range in 21 minutes, according to Lucid. The company also offers three years of free charging on Electrify America. That range alone surpasses most luxury EVs on the market.
I did the 230-mile round trip run in stop-and-go LA traffic and saw an average of 3.4 kW per mile — better than any of the other luxury EVs I’ve tested recently. The Air Touring comes with three standard modes, Smooth (eco/comfort), Swift (sport) or Sprint (sport +, where you can access the launch control function). I spent most of my test drive in Smooth since I was doing a significant amount of highway driving. In any mode, you can set the braking regeneration to a high or low setting. That regen, even in the lower setting, is aggressive. The moment you take your foot off the accelerator, the car will begin to slow quickly, which is great in stop-and-go traffic but less than ideal on fast highway runs or when the adaptive cruise shuts off unexpectedly. Once you get used to it, you’ll almost never have to touch the brake. If you’re coming out of ADAS, you’d better be ready to get on the accelerator to prevent a major slowdown. Lucid is a company full of automotive veterans who know how to design and create some of the best vehicles on the market. In spite of all of that talent, I still had to fight with features that come standard (and work) in lower-priced gas-powered and electric vehicles. Drivers should not have to actively manage lane-keeping and centering features. And while Alexa is fine for shopping, it’s one of the worst systems on the market for navigation. My test car, with its handful of additional options like the paint color, glass roof, upgraded sound system and “future-ready semi autonomous systems,” netted out at a whopping $128,550. While that’s less than a fully loaded BMW i7 (with a massive movie screen in the back and all the executive features you could want), it still left me a bit disappointed compared to my first drive in a Lucid Air Dream a couple of years ago. The Lucid Air Touring will certainly win the EV range wars, but the ADAS software and onboard navigation through Alexa still need some tweaks to truly take on the established players like Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and Tesla."

348,How open payment platforms boost fintech by meeting customer needs,[],,"From PayPal to Venmo, gift cards to wire transfers, clicking to tapping — the ways that consumers can now complete their purchases is almost as varied as the products that they’re buying. That’s great if you’re the one doing the shopping, but it’s a bit more daunting when you’re the seller, trying to keep up with demand from customers who expect to be able to pay how and when they want.  It doesn’t matter if the business is a small-batch candlemaker or a multinational corporation. To meet their customers’ needs and compete in today’s economy, businesses need underlying payment infrastructure that’s secure, flexible, and customizable.   They can attempt to develop it in-house, a bold ambition considering how quickly the market is evolving, or they can rely on the open payment platforms already boosting the fintech space. Whatever they choose, the stakes are high, according to Andre Machicao, Senior Vice President for Visa Acceptance Solutions, an open payment platform that allows for sell anywhere, pay anywhere capabilities. “The difference between a great and simple payment experience and a complex one can mean the difference of whether or not that customer’s going to return,” Machicao says.    Gone are the days when accepting cash and credit covered all your bases. “It used to be that payments were a very discreet step in a very linear process of transacting between the consumer and the merchant, and that’s really no longer the case,” Machicao explains. “Payments are much more now an integral part of this end-to-end commerce experience. And at the center of that, it’s really the consumers that are driving that change.” Nowadays, customers expect you to accept a $10 bill as seamlessly as you do a traditional card, or a mobile wallet that relies on Apple Pay, or even to be able to pay using an installment plan or autopay. And as soon as the public migrates to a new method, you need to be prepared to ensure the smoothest customer experience. However, the ideal payments platform shouldn’t just be nimble enough for those sellers to keep up with changing consumer behavior. It should also maximize approval rates, minimize fraud, and improve your market share, all while being hyper-secure. “A payment information breach can be tantamount to a natural disaster for a business,” Machicao says. Accomplishing such a feat can be difficult to do in-house.   Instead of building their own payment solutions, sellers, software vendors and financial institutions can turn to open payment platforms that offer a cheaper, less burdensome, more secure alternative that gets them faster to market. Consider the Visa Acceptance Platform, the underlying technology for Visa Acceptance Solutions that aggregates all of the payment services you need, available in a modular fashion to configure and use only what you need. “We’ve also incorporated access to a broad ecosystem of ISV and tech partner services to help our customers really rapidly unlock new capabilities,” Machicao says. To clarify the difference between an open platform and one that’s semi-open or closed, Machicao draws a comparison between Legos and a board game. With Legos, you can “assemble really whatever you want and have it service the needs that are tailored to your specific design.” Meanwhile, a board game is limited by “very specific pieces, and you can only play it one way with the provided rules.” With an open platform, the system automates, mobilizes, and simplifies the connection between sellers, independent software vendors, and acquirers and processors. That functionality is accomplished through the Visa Acceptance Platform products, which help to accept payment digitally, in-person and manage compliance everywhere in between. Built on a network that can handle 5,300-plus transactions per second — over 5.8 billion a year — the Visa Acceptance Platform is exactly what a payment solution should be: fully customizable for any sector and for any business, whether it’s a scrappy start-up clawing its way through a cut-throat industry, or an established, laid-back firm maintaining its steady growth in a stable market. To offer fully bespoke services, it relies on insight from more than half a million customers, including leading global retailers, food delivery businesses, travel, and transit sellers. For these reasons, the Visa Acceptance Platform is essential for any business hoping to expand its footprint. “In theory, the options are limitless, especially when you talk about a global merchant who’s servicing clients in multiple geographies,” Machicao says.   In many ways, joining the digital economy has never been easier. With a great idea, captivating imagery, and the right website template, you can be online and ready for business within a workday. But in other ways, being a reliable, trustworthy seller has never been more difficult.  With so many payment methods available to customers — and so much sensitive personal financial information tied to those methods — businesses have to ensure that they’re balancing flexibility and security. While it’s possible to develop those capabilities in-house, plug-and-play payment services like the ones available via the Visa Acceptance Platform are the more efficient option for any business that wants to enable new payment experiences before consumers even realize they want them. “This platform really is designed to allow all of our clients and partners to keep pace with this industry change without having to be constrained by the fixed capacity of their IT budgets or their IT departments,” Machicao says.

This comes more than two years after the e-commerce giant partnered up with AT&T for a similar feature. Customers will need to enable the T-Mobile with Alexa skill from the Alexa Skills store and link their number to get started. Once the setup is complete, they can say, “Alexa, call John,” or “Alexa, dial XXX-XXX-XXX,” to make a call. When receiving a call, they can say, “Alexa, answer call,” or “Alexa, dismiss call.” Users can also call 911 emergency services through Alexa by saying, “Alexa, call 911.” After the setup, calling will be available on all Alexa-enabled devices linked to your account. To disable calling on any of them, go to More>Settings>Communication in the Alexa app, then tap on T-Mobile and unselect devices under the “Allow calling on” section. “With this new Alexa Skill, you have the ability to integrate your mobile number with Alexa across all three major network carriers in the U.S.: T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. This benefit provides you with more choice and makes it easier to connect with family and friends who matter most, whenever you want and wherever you are,” Amazon said in a blog post. T-Mobile’s support page suggests that prepaid, business, government and Sprint accounts are not eligible for this service."
350,"After stints at SpaceX, three brothers want to build spacecraft powered by moon water",['@breadfrom'],"April 13, 2023","A new startup founded by a trio of SpaceX veterans — who happen to be brothers — aims to build an in-space transportation network, using reusable spacecraft propelled by water harvested from the moon. Argo Space Corporation, founded by Robert Carlisle, Ryan Carlisle and Kirby Carlisle, is betting that lunar propellant will untether space activities from Earth — and unlock a bustling economy beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Their plan takes aim at several key limitations of the space economy: First, all existing orbital transport vehicles are focused on LEO, not more demanding orbits like geosynchronous (GEO) or cislunar. Second, none of these vehicles are reusable. Third, there’s no method of refueling even a theoretical reusable vehicle. And last, any such method would likely depend on Earth-based resources for propellant. Hermosa Beach-based Argo aims to solve these limitations. The company’s first spacecraft is called the Argonaut, after the famous seafaring heroes of Greek mythology. The Argonaut is designed to be reusable and refuelable, and with the ability to perform energy-intensive transfers to GEO and beyond. But the whole operation would depend on lunar water, which the company plans to harvest and store in-space for refueling. Water as a choice of spacecraft fuel is not a novel concept. In 2021, NASA launched a demonstrator CubeSat carrying a pint of water to test a novel water-based propulsive method. While Argo is not disclosing too many details about their system, the company did clarify that it will use a water plasma thruster. “We look at this a lot like the California Gold Rush, where we are going to be commercializing this resource on the moon — water — and that’s going to enable a whole lot of other companies to build up their businesses, go after other new resources and bring new capabilities into the space that otherwise wouldn’t be possible or at all or economical without a service like ours,” COO Kirby Carlisle explained. The company’s plan is an ambitious one, but it has attracted the attention of investors. Argo recently closed a $2 million funding round led by Type One Ventures, with participation from Boost VC, Stellar Ventures and Earthrise Ventures, to continue development on its tech. No doubt the investors were impressed by the founders’ experience: All three brothers worked at SpaceX, with CTO Ryan Carlisle most recently acting as director of launch engineering, where he led large engineering teams on projects including Falcon and Starship. He also worked on an in-space refueling system project, part of a contract NASA awarded SpaceX in 2020. Argo’s focus on water as a propellant partly stems from Ryan’s experience working with cryogenic propellants, like liquid oxygen, methane and hydrogen, he said in an interview. “Cryogens are not fun to work with,” he said. One reason is because they need to be stored at extremely low temperatures to remain in a liquid state — but such extreme lows can affect the material properties of things like actuators, seals and the other essential components of a propulsion system. Kirby, who worked on post-launch refurbishment of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles at SpaceX and is now Argo’s COO, also experienced the difficulty of working with cryogenic fuels. “Working in refurbishment on the launch vehicles, I saw repeatedly that made it very difficult to easily reuse components, especially in a rapid manner,” he said. “Sealing, as Ryan mentioned, is a massive problem.” Water, on the other hand, is “serendipitously good as a medium to work with,” Ryan said. It doesn’t have the same corrosive effects on materials, for one. One of its biggest upsides, especially for Argo’s plans, is that it can be stored for long periods. This makes it a useful propellant for in-space refueling depots and for long-duration missions. Argo has a long way to go before its vision can be fully realized, however. While the company says it has figured out its lunar water extraction process, it still needs to get hardware on the moon and prove out its plan. Argo CEO Robert Carlisle said the company wanted to be on the moon, processing regolith and turning it into water, in the late 2020s. Recent missions, including NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and China’s Chang’e-5, have uncovered the existence of water on even the sunlit portions of the moon, which will no doubt make Argo’s initial plans much more technically straightforward. “We are talking to all the lander and rover companies you might imagine about getting a first demo down,” Robert said. Until then, the company plans to generate revenue from in-space transportation services, with Argonauts that use water from Earth as propellant. The spacecraft could also be used for satellite inspections or even orbital debris removal, thanks to its ability to rendezvous with other objects in space. The next big milestone for the company will be an initial demonstration mission scheduled for late 2024, to prove out the propulsion technology and the spacecraft capture mechanism. Robert, who was SpaceX’s director of commercial launch sales and had also worked as director of national security satellite sales, said Argo’s transportation network could solve the pain point for small satellites getting access to higher energy orbits beyond LEO. “People would come to me at SpaceX and try to find these secondary rideshare launches,” he said. “It’s hard, it’s expensive. It’s difficult to build a business around that. So we combined Ryan’s lunar resource idea with this idea of more abundant, accessible transportation — not just in low Earth orbit, going all the way to geostationary orbit or lunar orbits.”"
351,WWDC returns to Apple Park June 5,['@bheater'],"March 29, 2023","There are some things you can set your watch to. The occasional global pandemic excepted, developer season is certainly one. After Google I/O and Microsoft Build, WWDC will return to Apple Park in Cupertino. The event, which runs June 5 to 9, looks to be another scaled-down version of the big developer-centric show, similar to last year’s. The days of renting out a massive San Jose convention center may be behind us for good. Things will kick off with a keynote on the 5th, showcasing the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, followed by four days of programming and additional events for those folks immersed in the software. The event has brought some hardware news in recent years, as well, owing to the shift to Apple silicon for the Mac. It seems likely that cadence will continue for this year’s event. With rumors mounting around a long-awaited Apple XR headset launching this year, WWDC seems like an ideal platform for getting developers on-board ahead of a commercial release. That would certainly add a tinge of excitement to the proceedings. As with last year’s event, WWDC 2023 will be streamed live in its entirety through Apple’s site. The company adds: In addition, Apple will host a special all‑day event for developers and students on June 5 at Apple Park. Watch the keynote and State of the Union videos together, meet some of the teams at Apple, celebrate great apps at the Apple Design Awards ceremony, and enjoy activities into the evening. The invite is fairly straightforward — the rainbow is in keeping with the theme of past Apple Park events. If I really wanted to read into it, I’d say the array mimics the curvature of a VR headset, but that’s probably a stretch."

353,"Sequoia Capital India, GFC back 1-click payment checkout startup Nimbbl in $3.5m funding",['@jagmeets13'],"March 28, 2023","Nimbbl, an Indian startup that offers a one-click payment checkout solution for merchants, has raised $3.5 million in seed and pre-Series A funding from Sequoia Capital India, Global Founders Capital (GFC), financial services platform Groww and a list of angel investors. The Mumbai-based startup’s solution works with a list of payment methods, including various Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) options and the Indian government’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) infrastructure. Nimbbl personalizes the experience for merchants’ customers by showing them payment methods relevant to them instead of populating every solution on the face of the earth. Former Citrus Pay and PayU executives Anurag Pandey and Amit Bansal founded Nimbbl in October 2020. The duo chanced upon the idea while working at Indian fintech startup Safexpay after leaving Citrus Pay and PayU, Pandey told TechCrunch. “We felt that this problem needed to be solved from scratch, and we need to compress thinking on how to go about solving it,” Pandey said. By personalizing the checkout experience for customers, the payment initiation rate on Nimbbl goes up by about 40%, which translates to a 6%–8% increase in revenue for merchants, he said. In India, several payment aggregators already offer proprietary checkout experiences that merchants can deploy, but those tend to not solve the payment initiation problem nor do they remove the friction customers face in narrowing down the relevant payment instruments, he said. In some cases, the checkout solutions offered by aggregators also have limited payment options and often don’t include modern ones such as UPI and BNPL, which digital-savvy customers often look for. Similarly, e-commerce platforms such as Shopify provide their one-click checkout solutions in markets including the U.S., but those offerings are not available to Indian customers. Nimbbl’s solution can be integrated within a website, mobile app or platforms such as WooCommerce, Magento or Shopify. Since its launch, Nimbbl has attracted over 4,000 merchants to its checkout solution. It counts Indian airline Go First, audio device maker Skullcandy and cruise liner Cordelia Cruises among its clients. Nimbbl recorded about $240 million in total payment volume in the financial year 2022-23, and has so far clocked between $970 million and $1.2 billion this year. The startup has a team of 37 people spread across Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru. Digital transactions in India surged by nearly 54% to $36.78 trillion in FY 2021-22 from $23.87 trillion in 2017-18, per data presented by the government last month. This growth is anticipated to persist given India’s ongoing digital transformation. Nimbbl’s success in the last one-and-a-half years of its existence also helped it attract Palo Alto-based angel collective Amara VC as well as Indian internet entrepreneurs and executives such as CRED founder Kunal Shah, Pine Labs CEO Amrish Rau, and Jupiter founder Jitendra Gupta to participate in the all-equity funding rounds. Pandey said Nimbbl will deploy the funds to scale its system and invest in sales."

355,Dan Teran shares Gutter Capital’s challenge of closing its first fund,['@christinemhall'],"March 29, 2023","Gutter Capital, a New York venture capital firm, closed on $25 million in capital commitments for its first fund to invest in pre-seed and seed stage companies focused on affordability, economic mobility and climate change. Founding partners Dan Teran and James Gettinger met while students at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to starting Gutter Capital, Teran started his first company, Managed by Q, which automated office management. He sold that business to WeWork in 2019 for $220 million and joined the company to lead global corporate development and ventures following the acquisition. Meanwhile, Gettinger was initially involved in online gambling, winning multiple world competitions before developing a software-driven process to predict athlete performance and opponent behavior. In 2017, they began investing some of Gettinger’s gambling winnings, and then later Teran’s Managed by Q proceeds, building a portfolio of over 100 angel investments, which included Bowery Farming, Electric.ai and Ribbon Homes.   Then they went out and raised external funds. We’ve covered the dry powder that venture capital firms are sitting on and also how difficult it is to raise funding in this economic environment. Though Teran and Gettinger were able to surpass their initial goal of $15 million, Teran was quite candid about their experience, which started at the end of 2021 and ended with them closing the fund earlier this year. “It was way harder than venture capital as a founder,” Teran told TechCrunch. “I thought that having a successful exit behind me would be easier, so I was kind of surprised at how little credit you get for that.” He explained that when pitching as a founder, you share the vision of the company and can show what you are building. With a venture capital firm, you are pitching on an investment thesis, what he called “a mystery bag of companies that you haven’t invested in yet.” They also had to prove that they could translate their angel investing experience into leading rounds. “It’s harder for them to get excited about that,” Teran added. “One thing I hadn’t accounted for is everyone pitches the exact same thing when you’re raising a venture fund. Everyone says they help founders with recruiting, and while we think we do things differently, it’s really hard to make your case when they’ve heard the same thing a hundred times already.” Gutter Capital now has the backing of individual investors, including Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, Hunter Walk and Satya Patel of Homebrew, Eileen Murray (former co-CEO of Bridgewater Group) and institutional investors Tiger Global Management, Bain Capital Ventures, FJ Labs and Kapor Center Investments. Teran and Gettinger are investing initial $1.5 million checks in founders with focuses on software-as-a-service and marketplace businesses working in three areas: improving accessibility and affordability of healthcare, housing and education; technology that empowers individuals, entrepreneurs and small businesses to thrive; and reducing carbon emissions and preparing at-risk communities to cope with a changing climate. They have already invested in 13 companies in the past year, including flood management startup Forerunner, tiny-home developer Den, and The Climate Choice, a company working on carbon emissions.   The pair are also committed to having a diverse portfolio, which is composed of 38% women-led founders, 48% non-white founders and 15% Black or Latinx founders. While it may seem like everyone was struggling to raise funding, Gutter Capital joins a handful of firms that also raised their first funds in the past six months. For example, Fiat Ventures, The Family Fund and New Fare Partners. If you look closely at these firms, it appears a trend is emerging in partners not only coming from unique backgrounds, but also investing in more niche areas. When asked why founders should choose Gutter Capital to back them, Teran said that not a lot of people are investing at the pre-seed and seed stages, but even fewer are operators that raised venture capital and exited a business. In addition, Teran and Gettinger have Richard Hughes as an operating partner. He was a former employee of Teran’s at Managed by Q who has also previously led talent acquisition at Primary Venture Partners and Alma. So far, the firm supported 46 of the 89 hires made by the Gutter Capital portfolio in 2022. “As a result of having exited a business just a few years ago, we have a really great network of operators, other investors and vendors,” Teran added. “We really try to be a true partner to the founders. I noticed the biggest challenge was getting really good people to come and work for me when I was 24 years old. Richard and I are able to partner on recruiting key leadership roles and really help our founders amplify their reach to get top talent into the portfolio.” Meanwhile, the firm has already begun raising for its second fund.   Editor’s note: March 30, 2023, 1:52 p.m. PST: The investment in Unit, a startup making it easier for workers to form labor unions, is not part of Fund I."
356,Blank Street cracked the code on making coffee shops attractive to VC,['@rebecca_szkutak'],"April 19, 2023","In the Summer of 2020, a mint green coffee cart appeared in Williamsburg’s McCarren park near the Greenpoint entrance — directly across the street from a Starbucks. It was cute, and, at least to me, appeared to be a new independent coffee place. A few months later, when I saw that the cart’s parent company, Blank Street, had raised venture funding, I didn’t get it. Why on earth does a coffee cart need venture funding? Even upon finding out it was a chain, the math just didn’t make sense to me. Venture capitalists don’t generally seem to like brick-and-mortar businesses. Nor do they like asset-heavy companies. This looked like both. But Blank Street claims to have cracked the code on how to make a chain of more than 65 physical coffee shops have the right metrics to attract venture capitalists. They recently closed on a $20 million Series B round amid a year where fundraising has taken a nosedive — even for companies with low overhead costs. Blank Street was founded in 2020 by Vinay Menda and Issam Freiha who previously co-founded Reshape Ventures. Reshape invests in tech-enabled businesses that need real estate to scale, according to Crunchbase. The pair adopted their own thesis to try to fix the issue of consumers wanting better coffee but not wanting the higher prices usually associated with it. Of course, Blank Street isn’t the first VC-backed coffee shop. Luckin, Blue Bottle and CafeX came before it. But for Menda and Freiha the key to doing this was to create a business model that leaned on scale — over everything else. "
357,Google says it just made Chrome a lot faster on both Mac and Android,['@sarahintampa'],"April 13, 2023","Google’s Chrome web browser is getting a speed boost. According to a news announcement out today, Google has made several under-the-hood performance improvements to its popular browser, leading to a significant new performance milestone across Mac and Android. Collectively, a series of adjustments gave Chrome a 10% increase on Apple’s Speedometer 2.1 browser benchmark over the course of three months, Google says. The changes involve a range of tweaks from improved caching to better memory management, the company notes. This includes things like improved caching and better memory management. While not everyone will care about the technical details as to how the speed improvements were accomplished, many will care to see their browser get faster. Despite user complaints over the years about Chrome’s growing sluggishness, Google’s browser still runs away with a large majority of the web browser market share. Per Statcounter’s March 2023 statistics, for example, Chrome is pulling in 64.8% of global market share, while its next closest rival, Safari, is at just 19.5% across all platforms. On the desktop alone, Chrome’s share is even higher — 65.8%, trailed by 11.12% for Edge then 10.91% for Safari. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google In a blog post, Google explained exactly what sort of tweaks it made to achieve the new milestone. It said it found some targeted optimizations for the highly-used JS “Object.prototype.toString” and “Array.prototype.join” functions, specifically. It also implemented targeted improvements in CSS’s InterpolableColor. Additionally, the company noted that “innerHTML” is a common way of updating the DOM via JavaScript so it introduced specialized fast paths for parsing. Another improvement involved more efficient pointer compression and involves better memory management techniques. This one impacts operations that take place frequently, leading to a more widespread performance boost. The post also talks about the relocation of frequently accessed objects — like JavaScript’s “undefined” — to the beginning of the memory bases, where they can be accessed with faster machine code. If none of those details matter to you, this might: At least one of the improvements Google made will also benefit WebKit, the browser engine developed by Apple and used in Safari and will be included in that engine, too. That means even more web browser users may see improvements, not just Chrome users."
358,"TikTok partners with top publishers on its new premium and brand-safe ad slot, ‘Pulse Premiere’",['@sarahintampa'],"May 4, 2023","TikTok is partnering with big-name publishers, including NBCU, Condé Nast, DotDash Meredith, BuzzFeed and others, in an effort to pull in more premium ad dollars. At this week’s NewFronts, the video entertainment company announced a new premium ad product that would allow marketers, for the first time, to position their brand ads directly after TikTok’s publisher and media partners’ content in over a dozen categories, including lifestyle, sports, entertainment, education and more. The ad slot, dubbed “Pulse Premiere,” offers a sort of brand-safe space within TikTok’s social video network, as they’re guaranteed their ads will run immediately after what TikTok refers to as “suitable TikToks” from premium publishers. The move could address potential concerns over ad placement amid user-generated content that, in years past, has caused disruptions to YouTube’s ad revenue, as bands have had to freeze ads due to offensive and obscene material ranging from hate speech to child safety issues, and more. With TikTok’s new offering, marketers can be assured of their placement as the content will run only alongside trusted publishers. In addition to NBCU, Condé Nast, DotDash Meredith and BuzzFeed, the company is also partnering with Hearst Magazines, Major League Soccer, UFC, Vox Media and WWE on the new program. In addition, marketers will be able to use TikTok’s ad platform to tie their campaigns to tentpole events through Pulse Premiere, the company says. Meanwhile, for publishers, the new ad slots will help them generate increased revenue from their TikTok investments by way of a revenue-sharing agreement. TikTok declined to share how much the new Pulse Premiere ad placements will cost, saying only that they are “premium ad placements.” It also didn’t detail the revenue share for participating publishers. “At Condé Nast the power of our brands allows us to create culture-defining content for 1B of the most engaged audiences across many relevant platforms,” said Pam Drucker Mann, global chief revenue officer & president, U.S. Revenue & APAC at Condé Nast, in a statement. “TikTok has become one of our most valuable partners, providing us with a variety of tools to ensure that our brands are driving these conversations on their platform. Our advertisers know that culture is the new KPI, and the Pulse Premiere solution finally enables clients to match media buying with how consumers are consuming our brands, like Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair, on TikTok,” she added. Pulse Premiere is built off TikTok’s initial Pulse offering launched last year, which allowed marketers to place their ads next to the top 4% of content on the platform. The program was the first ad product to offer a revenue share with content creators, TikTok noted at the time. The company says its data indicates TikTok users are 2.6x more likely to interact with a Pulse ad versus a comparable ad on another video platform. It also notes that Pulse campaigns increased brand recall by +9.8%, on average, and awareness by +6.8%. However, in follow-up reports by Fortune, Insider and others, creators reported extremely low earnings from Pulse — seeing revenue not even exceeding $5, in some cases. Among those creators interviewed by Insider, the revenue per every 1,000 video view on Pulse, or RPM, was in the range of just $6 to $8. One likened it to nothing more than a small bonus for having a video go viral, but it’s clear creators are not meant to rely on the ad rev share to fuel their businesses. Instead, TikTok offers other monetization tools for creators like livestream gifting, subscriptions and a creator fund — though the latter has also been charged with paying out low amounts. Today, many creators make money through brand ad deals and sponsored content, not through the platform’s own tools for monetization. The ad product will roll out to U.S. advertisers in the second half of the year with other markets to follow."
359,The IRS is sending four investigators across the world to fight cybercrime,['@lorenzofb'],"April 21, 2023","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans to send four agents who specialize in investigating cybercrime to Australia, Singapore, Colombia, and Germany starting this summer. These four new positions represent a significant increase in the IRS’s global efforts to fight cybercrimes, such as those involving cryptocurrency, decentralized finance and crypto laundering services. In the last several years, agents working for the IRS’s Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) branch have had a key role in investigating crimes on the dark web as part of landmark international operations: the shutdown of the drug and hacking services marketplace AlphaBay along with the arrest of its administrator; the bust of the internet’s biggest child abuse website; and the takedown of a marketplace for stolen Social Security numbers, among several others. Until now, the IRS only had one cyber investigator abroad, in The Hague, Netherlands, mostly working along Europol since 2021. The expansion was first revealed by Guy Ficco, the IRS’s executive director for global operations policy and support for IRS-CI, during a panel at the Chainalysis Links conference on April 4. “Starting really now we’re going to be piloting for additional posts, putting dedicated cyber attaches in Bogota, Colombia, in Frankfurt, Germany, in Singapore, and in Sydney, Australia,” Ficco said. “I think the benefits have been — at least with the Hague and with Europol posts — have been very tangible.” IRS spokesperson Carissa Cutrell told TechCrunch in an email that the four new positions are part of a pilot program that will last 120 days, from June to September 2023, and are created “to help combat the use of cryptocurrency, decentralized finance and mixing services in international financial and tax crimes.” After the 120-day pilot program, the IRS will evaluate whether to continue having the agents in the new countries. “Success will hinge on the attachés’ ability to work cooperatively and train our foreign law enforcement counterparts, and build leads for criminal investigations,” Cutrell said. Chris Janczewski, who worked as a special agent in the IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit, said that growing the IRS’s presence abroad is an important step toward streamlining international investigations. “The U.S.-based case agent can’t always travel to coordinate with foreign partners on investigative needs and the cyber attaché has to act as the proxy for the case agent,” Janczewski told TechCrunch in an email. “Their expertise on knowing what questions to ask, what evidence can reasonably be obtained, and the impact of any cultural or legal implications.” Janczewski led the investigation into the largest dark web child abuse site, which was called Welcome to Video. He is now the head of global investigations at TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence company. He explained that depending on which country the IRS is working with, there may be different legal procedures to obtain evidence, “but often informal information in real-time is needed in fast moving investigations.” “In these situations, it comes down to professional relationships, knowing who to call and what to say,” he said. Apart from the five cyber investigators, the IRS has 11 attaché posts around the world, including Mexico, Canada, Colombia, Panama, Barbados, China, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., Australia and the United Arab Emirates. “These partnerships give CI the ability to develop leads for domestic and international investigations with an international nexus. In addition, attachés provide support and direction for investigations with international issues, foreign witnesses, foreign evidence, or execution of sensitive investigative activities in collaboration with our international partners,” the IRS-CI wrote in its 2022 annual report. “Attachés also help uncover emerging schemes perpetrated by promoters, professional enablers, and financial institutions. These entities facilitate tax evasion of federal tax obligations by U.S. taxpayers, as well as other financial crimes.” Do you have more information about any cryptocurrency hacks?

360,"Staytuned bags $34M in equity, debt to build ‘Salesforce suite for e-commerce’",['@christinemhall'],"April 6, 2023","Staytuned Digital has $34 million in new equity and debt to continue developing a software suite for e-commerce brands with a goal of what co-founder Serge Kassardjian described as “the Salesforce suite for e-commerce stores.” “E-commerce has completely shifted and is moving to these emerging platforms, with Shopify being the biggest one,” he said. “In turn, we’re buying and building software that’s around the Shopify ecosystem.” The software company focuses on Shopify merchants and acquires and builds e-commerce applications. It has acquired seven apps so far and is working with more than 28,000 customers, Kassardjian told TechCrunch. While Kassardjian declined to disclose revenue growth, he did say the company was EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter. The new investment includes $9 million in equity and $25 million in debt, with the option of taking up to $25 million more, Kassardjian said. To date, the company has raised $46.5 million in a combination of equity and debt. Investors in the new round include TenOneTen, Rembrandt VC, Hawke Ventures, DragonX, FJ Labs, Interlace, Riverpark Ventures, Comma Capital, Kotti Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, Jason Finger and a group of angel investors. Tacora Capital led the debt funding. TechCrunch profiled Staytuned back in 2019 when the company was focused on video. Kassardjian said that 11 months after starting the company, he and co-founder Randy Jimenez realized the product didn’t work and did “a hard pivot.” “We went to our board and told them that we had burned very little capital, say a half a million or so,” Kassardjian said. “All our investors were like, ‘we invested in you guys and we believe in you.’ So we went back to the drawing board and this was a successful pivot. We brought in a whole new set of investors as well, and every valuation has been higher and higher.” Lauralynn Drury has since joined the founding team to help build the products and scale the strategy. The new funding will enable Staytuned to acquire more apps — Kassardjian said there is a long pipeline of potential apps to acquire — hire additional engineers and scale faster. “Software is super high-margin and it grows faster than Shopify, while Shopify grows faster than the e-commerce ecosystem,” Kassardjian said. “So if we buy and build enough software, we can have the largest hub of brands and merchants using the software, which is going to drive e-commerce in the future.”  "
361,India government-backed open e-commerce network expands to mobility,['@refsrc'],"March 23, 2023","The Open Network for Digital Commerce, an Indian government-backed initiative that is attempting to “democratize” e-commerce with zero-commission, has set its eyes on another industry it would like to disrupt. ONDC, a non-profit firm set up by India’s commerce ministry in 2021, is opening up its railroads to serve mobility firms, it said at a press conference in Bengaluru today. The firm is kickstarting its mobility journey by on-boarding Namma Yatri, an on-demand auto rickshaw booking app operational in Bengaluru. The open source mobility app, launched recently, was developed by payments startup Juspay and says it serves nearly half-a-million customers and works with 45,000 drivers. Namma Yatri seeks to compete with Ola and Uber, undercutting the giants on fees that they levy on drivers and customers. ONDC, which requires its partners to perform know-your-customer verifications for safety concerns, will expand its mobility efforts to more states and cities and broaden the kinds of vehicles in its bouquet, said T. Koshy, the chief executive of ONDC, at the conference. “To make transportation convenient and affordable in our growing cities, it is important to provide a seamless experience to users. Open systems like ONDC enable the collaboration and interoperability needed to make it happen,” said Anurag Jain, Secretary of Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade, in a statement. With ONDC, New Delhi is seeking to replicate the success it has had with UPI, the interoperable mobile payments network that disrupted the walled-garden mobile wallet market that firms such as Paytm and MobiKwik enjoyed. With over 8 billion monthly transactions, UPI has become the most popular way Indians transact online. Paytm, PhonePe and Amazon are among ONDC’s partners today (but in many cases, in limited capacity), and Flipkart’s logistics network Ekart is currently piloting with ONDC, Koshy said. But despite the partnerships with key industry players — and talks are ongoing with many more, including Reliance Retail, Google Pay, Dunzo and Meta’s WhatsApp — ONDC has yet to make deeper inroads in the e-commerce market. Koshy dismissed the idea that the network needs established players to grow, and said it will be unfair to judge the performance of ONDC at such an early stage. To be sure, UPI also took years to make inroads in the payments industry, and large mobile wallet firms were not among the first players to join the interoperable network. For the mobility initiative, the network is open to collaborating with Uber and Ola under the same terms it offers everyone else, Koshy told TechCrunch in an interview. “Nowhere else in the world do open networks exist. It’s all proprietary and closed systems,” he said."

363,"If you’ve raised venture capital, you have to pay yourself",['@Haje'],"April 9, 2023","Forgive me, but this post will likely be a bit of a rant. I had a call with a founder I’m advising this morning. He is out there raising money, and he received a term sheet from an investor (yay!), but the investor suggested that the founder and his co-founder shouldn’t be taking a salary. The investor argued that the founders were “working for equity,” and that his investment shouldn’t go to the founding team. That, ladies and gentlemen, is absolute hogwash. Now, if this were an isolated incident, I might write it off as a clueless investor. As the fundraising climate is shifting, however, I’m hearing more investors suggesting things like “to extend your runway, you should raise from us, but not pay yourself.” The entire point of raising money is to go faster and to reduce your company’s risk in stages. At the pre-seed stage, there’s a lot of risk because a lot of things are unknown: Will the product work? Can you find customers? Will they pay for the product? And so on. However, there’s another risk to the company: At an early-stage startup, founders can’t afford to lose focus. I should have a big red button on my desk that makes a Voice of God shout “FOCUS!” at the startup founders I advise. This is the No. 1 challenge for most startups. It makes sense: Opportunities are everywhere and entrepreneurial folks are, well, entrepreneurial. It makes sense that they’d be tempted to keep their options as open as possible for as long as possible. But you know what is one of the biggest distractions? Not being able to afford your mortgage, rent, car payment or next shipment of Huel. As a founder, it is your duty to focus on building the startup so it is as successful as it can be as quickly as possible. As an investor in these startups, it’s your duty to help the startup get to that point in the shortest possible amount of time. Telling founders not to take a salary is wonderfully counterproductive on so many levels.   One caveat: That doesn’t mean founders should pay themselves way above market rates. That said, it also isn’t helpful if you are an experienced developer and you’re getting calls from Facebook recruiters offering you a $250,000 salary. On a good day, it’s easy to say no, but guess what? The life of an entrepreneur is hard and there will be many not-good days. On some of those days, throwing in the towel and taking the paycheck can seem mighty tempting. Pay yourself what you need and make it enough so you find it easy to say, “Well, I could be making more at Facebook, but I’m working on something I believe in here.” In other words: if your market rate is $250,000 per year and you can make your finances work by paying yourself $150,000, then pay yourself that much and set some milestones that will let you bump your salary closer to your market rate. If those milestones are tied to revenue or other financial goals, all the better. Try this on for size: “I am raising $3 million right now, and once the financing closes, I will pay myself a salary of $130,000. Once we hit $300,000 ARR three months in a row, I will pay myself a $30,000 bonus and raise my salary to $150,000 per year. Once we hit $1 million ARR three months in a row, I will pay myself a $50,000 bonus and raise my salary to $250,000 per year.” Here are four more reasons why you should tell that investor to roll up their term sheet as tight as it will go and archive it deeply into the filing cabinet that sees no sunlight. Investors who try to tell you that you are working for equity are being a little rude. Yes, as a founder, you do have the benefit of vesting equity in the company. But when you founded the company, you and your co-founders, per definition, owned 100%. That ownership percentage typically goes in only one direction as your company evolves. When you raise funding, you issue more shares and dilute yourself."
364,Isar Aerospace raises $165 million to bring more sovereign launch to Europe,['@breadfrom'],"March 28, 2023","German launch startup Isar Aerospace has scored $165 million (€155 million) in new funding as it races toward the inaugural flight of its Spectrum small rocket later this year. The company, founded in 2018, is one of a handful of European startups looking to fill the gap in the launch market on that continent. There are just two European rockets flying today: the heavy-lift Ariane 5, built by ArianeGroup, and Italian aerospace company Avio’s Vega launch vehicle. But Isar CEO Daniel Metzler told TechCrunch that European governments are waking up to the geopolitical and economic upsides to sovereign launch capabilities. “If you take a look at the European Union, even Germany itself, there’s a strong focus on the automotive industry. [The space industry] is a huge opportunity at the same time to build up another economical pillar that can be extremely profitable,” he said. Isar’s funding history reflects this increasing overlap between public and private interest. This most recent Series C round was led by investors including 7-Industries Holding, Bayern Kapital, Earlybird Venture Capital, HV Capital, Lakestar, Lombard Odier Investment Managers, Porsche SE, UVC Partners and Vsquared Ventures. Part of these funds are backed by the EU and programs managed by the European Investment Fund; last year, Isar also won a $11.3 million (€10 million) prize from the European Commission. Isar is taking a long-term approach, Metzler said. This thinking is built into the company’s decision to be fully vertically integrated, its automated, mass-manufacturing technique, and the design of the launch vehicles. The company is betting that some investments — in the vertical integration, for example — will eventually have a huge pay off, even if that pay-off is not realized for the first five or even ten vehicles. “I believe that you can be much cheaper if you’re actually fully vertically integrated — if you know how to do it,” Metzler said. “I think one of the big drivers for us early on was scalability. We wanted to not just build one or two vehicles a year, but tens of vehicles per year. In that case, especially with more and more units per year, it really starts paying off if you actually do it yourself.” Isar Aerospace co-founders Daniel Metzler and Josef Fleischmann. Source: Isar Aerospace Isar Aerospace co-founders Daniel Metzler and Josef Fleischmann. Source: Isar Aerospace Full vertical integration has had other benefits too, like being able to simplify the vehicle’s design and generate more of a buffer against ongoing supply chain issues facing other space companies, he added. The company will be flying five customer payloads on its first mission, which is scheduled for the second half of this year from Andøya, Norway. Isar signed an agreement with the space port, Andøya Space, for exclusive use of one of its launch pads for up to 20 years. Isar has also inked firm contracts with a number of customers for future launchers. Those customers span smaller startups, like OroraTech, a German space-based wildfire detection developer, and French electric propulsion startup Exotrail, as well as big corporates like Airbus Defence and Space. Isar’s first American customer is rideshare broker Spaceflight Inc., for a dedicated mission in 2026. The company has more work to do before the first launch — the next big milestone is integrated stage testing — but Metzler said he’s feeling positive about the progress. The company recently revealed on Twitter that it had run 124 hot fire tests of its Aquila rocket engine over a one-year period, an encouraging sign that the rocket is coming together. Isar is not the only European startup looking to take a slice of the burgeoning European launch market. The company is competing against fellow upstarts Rocket Factory Augsburg in Germany, Orbex and Skyrora in the United Kingdom, and a handful of others. Metzler’s hunch is that the competition will be steep. Looking even five or ten years down the line, there may only be around eight major launch players spread across the world, he said. “Probably you’re going to have three to four players in the U.S., maybe two players or so within Europe, maybe another two within Asia. That would be my guess.” “It’s not that many,” he added. “But look, if you divide the entire market globally for launch services by seven, eight companies, it’s a very lucrative business for those seven, eight companies.”"
365,"Hygraph raises $30M to scale out a new, federated approach to managing digital content",['@ingridlunden'],"March 29, 2023","Digital content and how we consume it continue to endlessly evolve, and so does the tech that helps manage all of it behind the scenes. In the latest development, Hygraph, a startup out of Berlin that has built a platform around a new, “federated” approach to content management — think: many sources of data and many endpoints for using it, and using composable architecture, orchestrating all of it from a single platform — has raised $30 million. The startup now has around 400 customers, which include major brands like Samsung, Philips and the FMCG conglomerate Dr Oetker, and the plan is to use the funding to continue developing the platform and how and where it can be used, as well as expand into new geographies. The round is a Series B and was led by European investor One Peak, with previous backers OpenOcean and SquareOne, as well as new individual investor Boris Lokschin (cofounder and CEO of Spryker Systems) also participating. The startup previously raised $13 million. It did not disclose its valuation. A number of startups have identified the opportunity to improve how organizations create and manage their content online. Some of these focus on specific verticals like Shopify while others like Wix have built frameworks to quickly get sites up and running. A newer generation of “headless” systems can be more flexible with controlling interfaces while also handling potentially huge amounts of data at the backend. And there are even some new players, such as Vue Technologies, which take an open source approach to improving management of the front end. Hygraph represents yet another chapter in this story. Its positioning goes a little like this: When it comes to engaging with digital content, the landscape has changed dramatically in the last 15 years. Not only do we have a plethora of screens, from traditional TVs and computers through to phones, watches and more, but the formats we see on these are constantly fragmenting and evolving. So, too, are the sources of data that are used to create and manage that digital content. While there are a number of services already on the market to address aspects of this state of play, there is no single platform out there that defragments the experience and brings the back and front sourcing and data management challenges together into one place. This is what Hygraph is aiming to do; it calls its approach “federated content.” “We are turning headless around,” Michael Lukaszczyk, the CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. “We are not just front end agnostic but also back end agnostic. We make it easy to integrate the back end and front end into one universal content API.” One of the big benefits of this is that by building all of this around APIs, you can essentially update information and send it out to other systems much more efficiently, essentially in real time, which makes systems work better and more cheaply over time. This may be an “overpowered” approach for basic sites these days, Lukaszczyk admitted, but it’s essential for large organizations coping with huge amounts of traffic and multiple experiences on multiple platforms, marketplaces, social media sites and more. That could have an e-commerce focus, but could equally apply to media organizations managing video and so on. The company was originally called GraphCMS: it bases its framework around GraphQL and how it was built around the concept of composable architecture. Last September, it also released an API that supercharges where and how Hygraph can be used. “Despite the rise of the composable enterprise, many organizations are unable to unlock full value from their content,” said David Klein, co-founder and managing partner, and Tatjana Kast, director, One Peak, in a joint statement. “Hygraph solves the customisation and integration challenges that continue to slow the creation of new or complex digital services at scale. We have been hugely impressed with Hygraph’s strong and capital efficient growth trajectory and believe that its federated content platform presents a sizeable market opportunity. One Peak is incredibly excited to back the excellent Hygraph team and its founders in their next phase of explosive growth.”"

367,The best way to avoid a down round is to found an AI startup,['@alex'],"May 6, 2023","As we see unicorns slash staff and the prevalence of down rounds spike, it may seem that the startup ecosystem is chock-full of bad news and little else. That’s not precisely the case. While AI, and in particular the generative AI subcategory, are as hot as the sun, not all venture attention is going to the handful of names that you already know. Sure, OpenAI is able to land nine and 10-figure rounds from a murderer’s row of tech investors and mega-cap corporations. And rising companies like Hugging Face and Anthropic cannot stay out of the news, proving that smaller AI-focused startups are doing more than well.   In fact, new data from Carta, which provides cap table management and other services, indicates that AI-focused startups are outperforming their larger peer group at both the seed and Series A stage. The dataset, which notes that AI-centered startups are raising more and at higher valuations than other startups, indicates that perhaps the best way to avoid a down round today is to build in the artificial intelligence space. Per Carta data relating to the first quarter of the year, seed funding to non-AI startups in the U.S. market that use its services dipped from $1.64 billion to $1.08 billion, or a decline of around 34%. That result is directionally aligned with other data that we’ve seen regarding Q1 2023 venture capital totals; the data points down. "
368,"As YC launches new batch, here’s how the early-stage venture market is faring today","['Alex Wilhelm', 'Anna Heim']","April 5, 2023","Today, Y Combinator’s latest startup cohort will kick off a two-day presentation cycle. The Exchange loves a demo day, so we keep an eye on accelerators as best we can. We recently covered the latest concerning YC’s rival group Techstars’ geographic footprint as well. As we wait for the first presentations to begin, this is a good time to take a quick look at the early-stage venture market that companies from accelerators of all stripes will operate in this year. Thanks to some early data from Carta, which many startups use to manage their cap tables, we can sketch a pretty clear picture of the state of venture for young tech upstarts. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. We recently learned that the earliest-stage rounds aligned the quickest to new market norms, while Series A and later “middle-stage” rounds are still adapting to the changed venture market. We are not looking at Series D and later rounds today, saving our fire there for when we have more data and time. Let’s talk median round sizes and deal values for seed through Series C in the first quarter of this year. How rough has 2023 been so far compared to a year ago? Have we seen any signs of recovery from Q4 2022? Is it getting easier for founders to raise money? The answers to those questions are not incredibly encouraging, except, it turns out, for the very smallest companies — like those we’ll see later today. Before we dive headfirst into the numbers, here are some caveats: First, we’re looking at data pulled from Carta’s users. That comes with considerations around the geography covered and the completeness of the data. Still, as Carta is a popular tool, its data is a strong place to start even if it is, as all datasets are, imperfect. Second, the market is interesting right now. The general perspective is that the strongest startups often had the best cash balances heading into the current downturn, and many of these have not raised any money since. This means there is likely some adverse selection bias at play in the data. The companies that needed to fundraise and did were perhaps, on average, worse off than the median for their stage. The following data could therefore prove slightly more pessimistic than what we would see if the full range of startups were fundraising today. Enough of that. Let’s see what the numbers can tell us about the early-stage market in Q1 2023 and what sorts of deals are being signed today. The seed stage is a bit of an outlier compared to later stages because venture funding for very early-stage startups has remained comparatively immune from the woes of the public market. As a result, pre-money median seed valuations have stayed relatively flat. That was true last quarter, too."
369,"Enter the Objaverse: 800,000 virtual props for AIs to play with",['@techcrunch'],"March 23, 2023","If AI is going to work its way out of the chat box and into our living rooms, it will need to understand spaces and objects better. To further that work, the Allen Institute for AI has created a gigantic and diverse database of 3D models of everyday objects, so simulations for AI models can be that much closer to reality. Simulators are basically 3D environments meant to represent real places that a robot or AI might have to navigate or understand. But unlike, say, a modern console game, training simulators are far from photorealistic and often lack detail, variation or interactivity. Objaverse, as it is awkwardly yet somehow pleasingly named, aims to improve this with its collection of over 800,000 (and growing) 3D models with all kinds of metadata. The things represented range from types of food to tables and chairs to appliances and gadgets. Any relatively ordinary object you might expect to see in a home, office or restaurant is represented here. It’s meant to replace aging object libraries like ShapeNet, an old standby database with about 50,000 less detailed models. If the only “lamp” your AI has ever seen is a generic one with no pattern or color, how can you expect it to recognize a funky cut-glass one or one with a totally different shape? Objaverse includes variations on common objects so the model can learn what defines them despite their differences. Sure, it probably won’t be necessary for your AI assistant to identify a bookcase as “medieval” or not, but it should definitely know the difference between a peeled and unpeeled banana. But you never know what might matter. Image Credits: AI2 Image Credits: AI2 Using photorealistic imagery (captured via photogrammetry, it is clear) also brings a level of diversity and realism that is obvious in retrospect. Sure, all beds look roughly the same, but what about unmade beds? All different! Having objects that also animate to do their “main thing” if you will is also helpful. Knowing what a refrigerator, cabinet, book, laptop or garage door look like closed is one thing and open is another, but how does it get from A to B? It sounds simplistic but if AI models aren’t provided this information, they aren’t likely to invent or intuit it. You can read more about the characteristics and details of this huge dataset in the AI2 paper describing it. If you’re a researcher, you can start using it now for free via Hugging Face."
370,"Hey look, unicorns are rare again!",['@alex'],"April 11, 2023","Investors are no longer minting nearly two unicorns per day. In fact, we’re down to barely more than one new mythical horned horse per week. Welcome to the new venture normal, where it seems stories of previously well-funded startups imploding will be more common than news of mega-rounds. Tracking the global venture slowdown is a twofold task: First, you have to monitor the slowing flow of venture dollars into startups, and second, it involves watching valuations contract as pre- and post-money valuations wilt under stricter investing conditions. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. Declining valuations at tech companies big and small and the dearth of capital are together creating a parched startup landscape. From falling early-stage valuations to late-stage investment and valuations being decimated, it’s tough out there for startups. PitchBook data concerning new unicorns underscores how bad things are now: A measly 18 unicorns were minted in Q1 2023, compared to 163 new unicorns in both Q3 and Q4 2021. The last time we saw the rate of new unicorns that low was back in Q3 2017. To put this into clearer context, the first quarter of 2023 saw new unicorns being created at a pace only fractionally better than the average quarterly rate in 2016. You know, the final year of the second Obama administration. A different era, in other words. How did we get here? Late-stage rounds got smaller but it wasn’t only that. Investors finally realized just how incorrectly they were pricing late-stage value creation during the recent venture peak."
371,Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried charged for allegedly bribing Chinese officials,"['Jacquelyn Melinek', 'Alex Wilhelm']","March 28, 2023"," U.S. prosecutors today filed a superseding indictment against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried alleging he bribed Chinese officials. According to court filings from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, “in or about 2021,” Bankman-Fried “authorized and directed a bribe of at least $40 million to one or more Chinese government officials.” Why would he want to spend so much to buy influence with officials in a country where crypto is legally restricted? Per the same filing, the “purpose of the bribe was to influence and induce one or more Chinese officials to unfreeze certain Alameda trading accounts containing over $1 billion in cryptocurrency” that had been frozen by the country. Given the fraught geopolitical climate between the United States and China, TechCrunch doubts that this particular bit of the case will serve to endear the former entrepreneur to his government. This news comes a day after the U.S. government took action against Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Zhao and several other corporate leaders at the world’s largest crypto exchange are being sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission. The federal government has been on something of a roll when it comes to taking legal action against leading, or formerly leading, crypto exchanges and companies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) served U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase with a Wells notice recently, though the precise outlines of the SEC’s complaint are not yet clear. The SEC also sued Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, last week on allegations of orchestrating “unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” The SEC said it was suing Sun, the Tron foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation and BitTorrent (now referred to as Rainberry) over the sale of two tokens: TRON, or TRX, and BitTorrent, or BTT. Both TRX and BTT were referred to as unregistered crypto asset securities by the SEC, stoking the debate on whether cryptocurrencies are in fact securities. A plethora of U.S.-based charges and suits have hit the crypto industry, and this latest filing may point to bigger legal issues beyond the States’ borders, raising the specter of other international enforcement actions against crypto-focused companies that operate either in a floating capacity or are domiciled outside of their founder’s home market. While Bankman-Fried and Zhao’s situations are different, they both point to the lack of operational transparency at both organizations. Given that new information surrounding Bankman-Fried is still coming out, there’s a chance that the Binance situation will also continue to develop in the coming weeks, months — and maybe even years. As these suits play out, it’ll be interesting to see how the courts and respective parties address the crypto industry and label cryptocurrencies and investment vehicles, which could set the framework for the future."
372,Spotify-owned Findaway Voices eliminates distribution fee for audiobooks on the streaming service,['@aiishamalik1'],"May 1, 2023","Spotify and Findaway announced today that Findaway Voices, an audiobook distributor for independent authors, is eliminating its 20% distribution fee for audiobooks purchased on Spotify. The streaming service acquired digital audiobook distributor Findaway back in November 2021. Findaway says the change means that Spotify now offers the highest royalty authors can make when selling their audiobooks with Findaway Voices. The move sees Spotify courting independent authors to its platform with the allure of higher earnings. “We’re excited to announce that starting in May, there will be no 20% Findaway Voices distribution fee for audiobook royalties with Spotify,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Findaway Voices pricing structure for audiobook distribution is a very simple 80/20 share, where you keep 80% of your royalties. Our standard 80/20 pricing will remain the same for all other partners—except Spotify, where we no longer charge a 20% distribution fee. When your audiobook is sold on Spotify now you receive all of the 50% of the list price you set. Authors can find a new audience on Spotify who recently announced that its global monthly active listeners are now 515 million strong.” With this update, Spotify is making its platform more appealing for authors. Spotify says it’s at the beginning of its journey to support independent authors, and that it has plans to help authors expand their reach, maximize revenue and build a strong audiobooks business, and notes that today’s news is part of this goal. Over the last few years, Spotify has been working to expand beyond music. The streaming service has invested hundreds of millions to build out its podcast business, and has been gearing up to take on the audiobooks industry. Last September, Spotify launched support for audiobooks for users in the United States. The initial launch included 300,000 titles. Similar to other audiobook apps, Spotify offers a standard set of features, including the ability to download titles for offline listening, rate titles, adjust the playback speed and listen across devices. Spotify expanded the audiobooks service to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand last November, and then brought it to Canada in March. At the time, Spotify said its catalog has grown to 350,000 titles. The company noted that it’s “seeing positive engagement,” without sharing any sort of metrics about what that may look like.  "
373,Let’s work together,['@bheater'],"April 20, 2023","There are about four duck boats lined up directly across the street from this coffee shop. Boston has a knack for reminding you where you are, should you get bonked on the head and suddenly forget what city you’re in. This is a far more truncated visit than the last time. Most likely as you’re reading this, TechCrunch Early Stage Boston will be well underway. I carved out a bit of time on either side of the event to meet some of the folks I didn’t get to see last time. I’ve got a few universities, research institutes and startups on the list. I’ll jump at pretty much any excuse to get back to Boston and Pittsburgh these days (let me know if there’s a good one for the latter in the next few months). Oh, and I’ve recently decided to swing by Detroit at the end of next month, so if there’s anything I definitely need to check out, let me know (accepting that our definitions of “definitely” may vary a good deal). Heading over to MassRobotics shortly, after a recent Zoom call with Tom Ryden, the org’s executive director. I’d been wanting to talk interoperability since my recent trip to ProMat. It’s something I’ve regrettably not yet managed to highlight in any sort of meaningful way in Actuator, so we’ll be making up for that today. As discussed the other week, along with autonomous mobile manipulation, cross-platform interoperability is a major holy grail for the industry. As companies increasingly push toward fully autonomous warehouses, the realization is no doubt quickly dawning that the goal can’t be achieved by relying on a single company. Will the day come when robotics firms will offer true top-to-bottom solutions? Maybe? Getting there would take a long time and a hell of a lot of money — be it through in-house R&D or acquisition (likely both). From what I’ve seen, most ARM firms in the space are largely focusing on their current addressable market (which is admittedly massive), rather than rushing into additional segments of the market. Amazon’s certainly pushing for it, but economic belt-tightening aside, a fat lot of good that’s going to do all of the non-Amazon companies out there. For the foreseeable future, increased automation means working with more robots from more companies. That presents the very real problem of interoperability. Put in the plainest language, you don’t want to suddenly find yourself tasked with running a warehouse of robots that don’t know how to work together. There are a lot of companies working on fleet management software, which we’ve talked about in the past and will, no doubt, talk about again soon. This week, however, I’m interested in something I’ve written about a lot with my consumer electronics hat, but very seldomly with the robotics one (it’s shaped like R2-D2. Got it on discount after Halloween). So we’re going to be kicking things off with the Q&A, then some more VC survey results, job listings and then back to your regularly planned roundup. Image Credits: Hi, this is a meme. Image Credits: Hi, this is a meme. TC: Why did MassRobotics take this problem on? TR: We took this on a couple of years ago, when we were talking to a lot of the manufacturers and customers of AMRs. It was clear that there isn’t going to be one solution. There isn’t going to be one AMR that does everything. We were starting to see things like AMRs and robotic floor cleaners get out there and we heard from major customers saying, “This is a problem. We have all of these platforms. We have to somehow manage them all in a better way. They’re all independent and they don’t speak to each other.” So we looked around and didn’t see anything. [We asked if] we could help and create a very low lift, very simple standard. It’s really a data exchange standard. Here’s a common way to broadcast information from each AMR and then we can have other companies develop software packages that display all of the different platforms and give you statistics on the systems and how they’re performing. We released that about a year and a half ago. It’s a pretty simple standard. We’re working now on the next vision. That will add complexity. What we didn’t do in the first one is task management or “tasking.” There was no ability for third-party software to go in and control any of the robots. Part of that is because none of the AMR vendors wanted that. They all have their own traffic management systems. They all believe their traffic management systems do the best for their systems and are optimized for their systems. I don’t disagree. Now we’re trying to work on a way that there will be some ability to manage different platforms without interfering with their set directions. You’re creating both the standard and the software? No. We are trying to provide software only as example. Sometimes it’s helpful to get example code for how you would implement this. Our standard is more guidelines. If you adopt the standard, you can interoperate with other systems that are operating in the same area that you are. What does it mean for them to communicate? I assume it’s not robot to robot? They’re not doing it robot to robot. They’re just sending a broadcast for anybody who wants to read it. We have a standard communications protocol, so anybody that has the ability to gather that data can. So I’m running a warehouse and now have something that allows them all to appear on the same map. Correct. And you can see how all of the different vendors are operating on one system. The people who are developing the third-party software are getting a lot of different information about the robot. They can show how things are performing in your warehouse and gather different things that are helpful for the warehouse operator to understand. Returning to the recent robotics VC survey, here’s this week’s question: TC: How is robotics investing different than in previous years? What role have the pandemic, slowing economy and recent bank crisis had on your investments? Kelly Chen, DCVC: The last few years have been a series of changing concerns as well as opportunities. After the major hardware supply chain issues, startups are learning to eliminate single points of weaknesses (i.e., bottlenecks to shipping products). This comes with sacrifices to the design and cost in the near term, but it will prepare robotics startups for strong and robust scaling in the long-term. A slowing economy usually means corporate customers are less willing to make large capital investments to solve their short- to medium-term labor problems, but robotics startups are increasing pushing for a recurring pricing model (robotics as a service) or a price per pick model, allowing customers to pay with a smaller lump sum and OPEX over time. As for the bank crisis, robotics startups often secure venture and equipment debt, so we are happy to see new banks step up to provide these types of services to the startup community. Rohit Sharma, True Ventures: I think the exuberance of 2021 and 2022 has given way to more rational exchanges between investors and founders. There is a renewed focus on the customer instead of growth or pure-technology, and there is an element of excitement about how fast-developing techniques in the machine learning and AI domain might play a role in delivering more effective robots. On the customer interaction front, there is a bit more of a focus on what value it delivers to them, and how quickly is that value going to make a difference in the customer’s operations. Kira Noodleman, Bee Partners: COVID-19 has urgently shown us a glimpse of a more roboticized, automated, resilient future of work that extends across the supply chain and beyond the mission critical. While this trend started in manufacturing, it has now moved well beyond into areas like healthcare, R&D, agriculture, waste management and many more. Our current volatile economy has made investors demand asset-lighter, often software-powered hardware solutions that bear less risk given the increased nimbleness of said solutions. What feels new today in automation is how quickly and flexibly you can set up a system to work. And there is an increasing industry acceptance that if it is too expensive to automate, it might as well be not possible (because everything technically can be automated). Globally, shifts in recent years have added pressure to the U.S. to step up its game. The average robot per 10,000 workers globally is 141 (source: IFR). In the U.S., we’re at 244 (above average), but there are six countries ahead of us: China just passed us (350), and the No. 1 is Korea (1,000!) — clearly they are a manufacturing juggernaut. Yet, the U.S. has the largest GDP in the world, and this feels unacceptable. More next week! Image Credits: Noah Medical Image Credits: Noah Medical Here’s an extremely healthy round for Noah Medical. The Bay Area–based firm this week announced a $150 Series B led by Prosperity7 Ventures  and featuring Tiger Global, along with Hillhouse, Sequoia China, ShangBay Capital, UpHonest Capital, Sunmed Capital, Lyfe Capital, 1955 Capital and AME Cloud. It probably won’t shock you to hear that it was an oversubscribed round. But robots are expensive, and medical robots are very expensive. Noah’s flagship product is the Galaxy System, which is used to more accurate pinpoint nodules for lung biopsies. “We are a mission driven startup and appreciate our investors’ support to allow us to scale and deliver on the future of medical robotics,” founder and CEO Jian Zhang said in a release. “Next generation robotics platforms like the Galaxy System are filling procedural gaps to provide superior clinical values to better serve customers’ needs. We are excited to welcome these investors to the team and are eager to grow and serve even more patients and clinicians.” The funding was, no doubt, helped along by the fact that the system received FDA clearance last month. It has also begun human trials at Sydney, Australia’s Macquarie University Hospital. Image Credits: CMU Image Credits: CMU Search and rescue is a big applications for autonomous robotic systems. Legged robots are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and better at navigating uneven terrain, but there are still a number of scenarios that present issues. A team at CMU is tackling one, taking on these systems’ ability to balance on narrow spaces. In the lab, that means teaching a dog robot how to walk a balance beam. The solution? Mounting a big flywheel to the dog’s back. Says CMU: Manchester said it was easy to modify an existing control framework to account for the RWAs because the hardware doesn’t change the robot’s mass distribution, nor does it have the joint limitations of a tail or spine. Without needing to account for such constraints, the hardware can be modeled like a gyrostat (an idealized model of a spacecraft) and integrated into a standard model-predictive control algorithm.

374,Deep Render lands $9M for its AI-powered video compression tech,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 29, 2023","Deep Render, a startup developing AI-powered tech to compress videos on the web, today announced that it raised $9 million in a Series A funding round led by IP Group and Pentech Ventures. A source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch that the round values the startup at $30 million, a respectable number for a five-year-old startup in light of the recent market turbulence. Co-founder and CEO Chri Besenbruch tells TechCrunch that the fresh capital, which isn’t inclusive of a new $2.7 million grant from the European Innovation Council, will be put toward product R&D and shifting Deep Render’s customer acquisition efforts toward the U.S. “The fundraising is driven by Deep Render hitting its internal milestones and triggering an inflexion point,” Besenbruch said via email. “As a super deep ‘hard tech’ company, we’ve successfully finished our R&D and productization.” Deep Render was founded by Besenbruch and Arsalan Zafar in 2018, after the two met at Imperial College London while studying computer science, machine learning and AI. Inspired by a research project they co-contributed to that involved sending terabytes of video data over a network, Besenbruch and Zafar were inspired to explore AI-powered video compression tech. The project frequently ran into network congestion–related technical roadblocks, leading Besenbruch and Zafar to investigate an alternative — and, with any luck, better — way. “We decided to fuse machine learning, AI and compression technology to develop a fundamentally new way of compressing data to get significantly better image and video compression ratios,” Besenbruch said. “We started Deep Render to free the world of all bandwidth limitations by pioneering AI-based compression … AI-based compression doesn’t try to ‘fix’ or ‘work with’ traditional compression, but replaces it entirely.” Take those pronouncements with a grain of salt. Deep Render isn’t the only venture applying AI to the problem of video compression, nor is its AI a silver bullet necessarily. Alphabet’s DeepMind adapted an AI algorithm originally trained to play board games to compress YouTube videos. Elsewhere, Nvidia, Disney Research and the University of California, Irvine have conducted independent experiments with AI-driven compression techniques for streaming video. Image Credits: Deep Render Image Credits: Deep Render Besenbruch believes Deep Render is differentiated by its AI compression algorithm, which was trained on a dataset of over 10 million video sequences. The company used a combination of on-premise and cloud hardware for the training, with the former comprising over a hundred GPUs. Besenbruch claims the algorithm is up to five times “better” than HVEC, the industry standard codec (he didn’t specify by what metric), and can run in real time across modern chipsets from Qualcomm, Apple and Nvidia. (For the uninitiated, a “codec” is software, or in some cases hardware, that can encode and decode data — usually audio or video data.) “In the compression industry, there’s a significant challenge of finding a new way forward and searching for new innovations,” Besenbruch said. “Traditional compression is not advancing sufficiently fast; it has only seen iterative progress for decades and has reached its peak … Deep Render is resetting the industry, benefiting its customers.” Whether or not that’s true, recent years have seen a surge of streaming video traffic, with Cisco predicting that video would account for 82% of all IP traffic by 2022. Besenbruch makes the case that better compression allows streaming video platforms (e.g., Twitch, YouTube and Netflix) to increase the quality of streaming without sacrificing in other, bandwidth-related areas — and hence an attractive investment. “If the internet pipes are difficult to extend, we can only make the data that flows through the pipes smaller,” Besenbruch said. Fortunately for Deep Render, there’s not much in the way of startup competition. Tucodec, a Shanghai-based rival, appears to have gone under; the website’s no longer reachable. As for WaveOne, another competitor, it raised $9 million throughout the course of its nine-year life span before disappearing with little trace. For its part, Deep Render has raised a total of $15 million and plans to take on venture debt soon. The startup is pre-revenue, but Besenbruch claims it has paid proof-of-concepts and pilots with three Big Tech companies with market caps of over $300 billion (he declined to name names). Proof of concepts are one thing, though. Time will tell whether Deep Render can convert those into recurring revenue. After all, there isn’t much reason for companies with the in-house talent to turn to third-party vendors like Deep Render; Netflix has historically trimmed its bandwidth needs by as much as 20% without AI. So Deep Render’s challenge will be convincing would-be customers that its product is truly exceptional in some way. “We expect 40 million daily users by 2023 and 300 million by 2024 … We project over $40M annual recurring revenue in 2024,” Besenbruch said optimistically. “The integration of our software into the platform systems of our Big Tech customers enables this growth.” Assuming the growth happens, London-based Deep Render expects to expand the size of its workforce from 25 people to around 45 by the end of the year."
375,Uber and Cartken are bringing sidewalk delivery robots to Virginia,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 20, 2023","Uber is expanding its partnership with sidewalk delivery robot startup Cartken to Fairfax, Virginia. Starting Thursday, Uber Eats customers around the Mosaic District can choose to have food from select merchants delivered via one of Cartken’s small, six-wheeled, autonomous bots. This is the second city where Uber and Cartken are partnering for commercial deliveries. The companies first launched a pilot in Miami in December, which is ongoing. The Mosaic District is a shopping and dining center, and the bots will deliver food from restaurants to homes and businesses “in an around” the district, according to an Uber spokesperson. Uber did not specify what the delivery radius would be, but the district is about 31 acres, or 0.5 square miles, according to the Fairfax County Department of Planning and Development. Cartken’s robots are electric and have a cargo capacity of around 1.5 cubic feet, or about two paper grocery bags. The robots have a number of cameras used to identify objects and help them reach their destination. Cartken has said before that its robots operate fully autonomously under certain conditions. If the bot meets something it hasn’t yet encountered, it can reach out to a remote operator for assistance. Aside from its partnership with Uber, Cartken has also linked up with Grubhub to bring bots to college campuses like Ohio State University. Sidewalk delivery robots are becoming increasingly common on college campuses, where the neatly lined pavements and closed environment make for a safe place to test autonomous tech. That’s also likely why the Mosaic District also makes for an attractive location for Uber and Cartken to launch their latest partnership. At launch, merchants like Our Mom Eugenia, Pupatella and RASA will participate in the program. Image Credits: Uber At launch, merchants like Our Mom Eugenia, Pupatella and RASA will participate in the program. Image Credits: Uber The companies wouldn’t share the size of Cartken’s fleet to be deployed, but Uber said it can be scaled to match customer demand. A spokesperson also told TechCrunch the robots can operate in all types of weather, even snow or rain. The spokesperson declined to provide exact hours that the bots will operate, but did say customers would be able to access them for lunch and dinner orders. From the customer’s perspective while ordering, nothing will change much. The customer will still pay the merchant for the cost of food, and may also pay a delivery charge to Uber. If a customer adds a tip, however, they’ll receive a refund on that tip. When the order is delivered, the customer will have to meet the bot outside and Uber will provide instructions for how to access their order. Uber has been increasingly adding to its autonomous vehicle pilot portfolio in recent years. Last May, the company began a pilot in Los Angeles to deliver food via Serve Robotic’s autonomous sidewalk robots and Motional’s self-driving cars. At the end of last year, Uber and Motional also launched a robotaxi service in Las Vegas, part of the companies’ 10-year plan to co-scale across major North American cities.  "
376,Edtech MindX wants to build ‘little Silicon Valleys’ across Vietnam,['@catherineshu'],"April 11, 2023","Founded in 2015, MindX was created to address the lack of coding in Vietnamese school curriculums. The startup’s goal is to create “small Silicon Valleys” across Vietnam, with educational centers that help prepare students of all ages for careers in tech. Since TechCrunch covered MindX’s Series A funding in November 2021, it’s tripled its geographical coverage to 32 campuses across Vietnam, graduated 35,000 students so far and connected students to employers in countries like Australia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and, soon, the United States. The startup claims to be the largest coding educator in the region. Today, the edtech announced that it has raised $15 million in Series B funding led by Kaizenvest, a private equity firm that focuses on the education space. Other investors included Thai education firm Aksorn, Japanese HR firm Mynavi and returning investor Wavemaker Partners. MindX also received another round of debt financing from Beacon Fund, an impact investment firm focused on women-owned and led businesses in Southeast Asia. MindX’s educational offerings have now expanded beyond coding to in-demand skills like blockchain, data analytics and UI/UX design. It also began entering Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities like Ha Long, Da Nang and Bien Hoa, with the goal of covering 45 cities by June. Founder Nguyen Thanh Tung told TechCrunch that that MindX had many students in those cities who had been taking classes virtually, and they started attending classes in person once new campuses opened. Nguyen said localization is very important to MindX as it scales into new areas. Before entering a new city or province, its team spends months visiting homes and getting to know students and parents. Then they customize their product offerings based on what they hear. Despite its hybrid model, most of MindX’s campuses are standalone, because this gives it better brand recognition and more control over curriculum and teaching quality. Before the pandemic, all of MindX’s classes were in person. During the pandemic, MindX shifted to a hybrid model, letting students attend classes at a campus or virtually from home. This helped the company reach new students in remote areas, and it continues to uses a hybrid model, with online classes for instruction and in-person classes for tutorials. “The transition to a hybrid model was not without its challenges,” said Nguyen. “It was an entirely different learning experience.” MindX had to revamp its course materials and learning experiences to make sure that both online and in-person delivery was seamless. For example, it added online mini-game and breakout room group discussions to its online classes to make them more engaging. MindX’s afterschool classes include web/blockchain programming, digital art, data analytics and UI/UX design. Courses range in length from two months to six years. One difference between MindX and other edtechs is that it focuses on getting students ready for new jobs (MindX currently has over 300 hiring partners). For example, it offers real-life projects, career talks and mock interviews. It also holds Demo Days, where students’ projects are judged by businesses. For students in longer courses, MindX hosts an entrepreneurial program with classes on marketing, fundraising and other business skills. At the end of the course, students apply their new skills to projects like websites, mobile apps and games. Then they can pitch their ideas for funding to a panel that includes MindX’s co-founders and representatives from venture firms. The new funding will be used to develop MindX’s product portfolio, its hybrid model and tech tools to increase Vietnam’s digital talent pool. Nguyen said MindX will focus on developing accredited programs and promoting gender equality in its courses with scholarships for female students. In a statement about its investment in MindX, Kaizenvest founder and managing partner Sandeep Aneja said, “The company (MindX) is well-positioned to lead the coding and digital skills space in Vietnam. We are delighted to associate with the founding team as they have consistently delivered high quality learning outcomes. We believe this investment fits within  the future of learning themes and is a testament to our confidence in the growing demand of technology courses across Southeast Asia during the long term.”  "
377,Intuit’s shift,['@jagmeets13'],"April 27, 2023","If artificial intelligence feels like it is taking over the world, that feeling has become an anxious obsession among larger tech companies. These are organizations that have typically thrived secure in the knowledge that they can keep a competitive edge through their very DNA: leveraging software to build more interesting, faster and disruptive products. Now, a big question hangs above all of them: Will the evolution of AI supercharge that whole model, or will it disrupt them, the previous generation’s disruptors? Intuit, the U.S. financial and accounting software behemoth, is among those sincerely hoping that it lands in the first of those camps. It may not have been at the forefront of developing generative AI, the plat du jour in tech, but it happens to have registered 700 AI-related patents covering areas like natural language processing and machine learning. And in its artillery is also the “oil” that many AI machines need to work: a trove of data and data infrastructure — including 730 million customer interactions and 58 billion machine learning predictions daily over the last five years — that it believes will help catapult it into a strong position in the future. But as you might guess, it hasn’t been a fully smooth ride. Intuit’s move, led by CEO Sasan Goodarzi, to becoming an AI-driven company has been well conveyed. Some of that has not been easy. In 2020, the company laid off over 700 employees, people working in less critical roles, adding a similar number of new roles, to mark a shift toward its AI plan. And big bets like Credit Karma — a high-profile acquisition for Intuit, buying it for $7.1 billion in February 2020 — saw “revenue challenges” that resulted in a halt in hiring last year. At the time, the division’s then chief people officer Colleen McCreary blamed it “due to the uncertainty of the economic environment.” Daniel Jester, director of equity research for software at BMO Capital Markets, told TechCrunch that while Intuit has framed the strategic vision as an “AI-driven expert platform,” its actual execution of that has not been quite so revolutionary. Intuit is currently focused on using AI and machine learning to augment the platform — not to build a full-scale replacement for financial experts in its tax and accounting software business. “In the near-term, similar to most companies, Intuit as an overall organization is attempting to drive efficient growth in a macro environment which has become more challenging for many of their customers,” he said. “But like many companies of its size, the factors impacting their success vary depending on the business unit.” On top of all this, Intuit also has a reputation of pushing against disruption in areas that might threaten its business. Specifically, it’s known for its strong lobbying efforts against free tax services in the U.S. Now, it looks like that is a hot potato Intuit could end up eating one way or the other: win the argument against free tax services; or win the business by making more compelling paid products that use AI. And that is the point: There remains still a lot of potential, and now that having an AI strategy is a must for tech businesses being scrutinized in the public markets, the company’s AI tune is getting louder. Intuit’s chief data officer Ashok Srivastava believes the company has the right mindset, based on the strategy that it set several years ago to position itself as an “AI-driven expert platform.” That is to say, Mountain View-based Intuit’s portfolio of services — which includes platforms to manage personal finance (Credit Karma), marketing automation (Mailchimp), accounting (QuickBooks) and income tax returns (TurboTax) — all have had, and will be getting, more of the AI treatment. “The AI that we build is built on a very vast data infrastructure that we’ve been creating over the last many years,” said Srivastava in an interview. “This enables real-time data, enables streaming use cases, batch processing, all the manipulation, all of the storage. And most importantly, the transmission of clean data happens in this infrastructure layer.” Srivastava joined Intuit in 2017 after cutting his teeth at IBM, Sama and NASA, where he handled technical and financial projects. He told TechCrunch that the goal with the AI strategy is to deliver “more money,” “reduce work” and “complete confidence” to customers.
If data is the new oil, then I would argue that AI is the new electricity. “Very few companies have the customers, the scale of data that we have and the expertise that we have,” he said. “There will always be competitors. But we’re singularly focused on the customer’s needs.” He believes that companies without AI capability will not survive over time. “If data is the new oil, then I would argue that AI is the new electricity,” he said. AI — both the talent to build it and work with it, as well as the tech itself — has been in demand for some time, but generative AI, which essentially works as a branch of AI that uses a large amount of data to create machine-generated content such as text, image and video, has taken interest and demand to new levels. Various consumer-focused companies have started deploying generative AI on top of their products and services to attract customers and increase efficiency, and simply to ride the wave of hype in the space. Companies like OpenAI have opened the door to the idea of a “general” AI capable of addressing any and all scenarios. But before that, companies like Intuit have been working on generative AI well before that to address more narrow use cases, according to Srivastava. One example Srivastava shared: live services within TurboTax and QuickBooks that allow customers to interact with human experts. Instead of letting the experts type notes as the customer is talking to understand their problem and offer them solutions, automatic transcripts are generated to keep a record of the conversation. After that, a generative AI capability summarizes the conversation into a few key steps to save everyone time at the end of the chat. Intuit also uses an AI-native experience to optimize data flows based on the financial transaction data it gets from customers. “We at Intuit deal with an enormous amount of financial transaction data. And as this data comes into our platform, we need to automatically categorize that data into different buckets for our customer,” said Srivastava. “What makes this problem hard is each customer has a different need for categorization. It’s completely personal… We actually reinvented this entire experience with artificial intelligence. We are building one model per customer, so that as this data flows in, each model does that optimization.” Intuit has its second-largest team in India after the U.S., with more than 1,600 employees working from Bengaluru. These employees are primarily tasked to help build solutions for global markets. “India plays a critical role in our artificial intelligence strategy,” said Srivastava. “One of the unique things about India is that it’s showing a tremendous opportunity in terms of the talent and the skills that we have here.” Indian engineers at Intuit work on AI, data and other capabilities that are being built into payroll and other parts of the company’s stack. Srivastava told TechCrunch that one of the key developments coming from the South Asian nation is an AI model for the mid-market. Stating how the Indian engineers help the company fulfill its plan to become an AI-driven player, Srivastava said he saw the local team developing a solution that includes deep statistics and machine learning to converse with customers and generative narratives. The solution is currently showing results using templates, but those will soon be converted into generative AI. “There are other areas in AI that the team has focused on, including modeling, churn and other aspects,” Srivastava said. Although India has been an important market from the engineering perspective, Intuit does not consider the country a significant consumer market. It discontinued QuickBooks for Indian customers in January this year. However, the company, which celebrated its 18th anniversary in the country this year, has committed to continue to support and invest in Indian talent. It is not the first time that Intuit has planned a pivot from a legacy software vendor. The company has a history of going through a number of shifts to stay relevant in the market. That includes recent acquisitions, such as those of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, which were made to expand to new kinds of business verticals. Those moves have already helped the company see 32% year-on-year growth in revenue to $12.7 billion in the fiscal year 2022. Now, the ongoing shift toward AI is expected to expand the company’s growth further. “Firms like Intuit could benefit from implementing the multiple pillars of AI that include descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, causal analytics and prescriptive analytics,” said Anindya Ghose, Heinz Riehl Chair Professor of Business at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business. “They will need to invest in the right infrastructure and resources to determine which of these four pillars are most relevant to their lines of business. They need to identify complementarities between human intelligence and machine intelligence.” Nonetheless, Intuit has challenges while looking to grow as an AI-driven company. Steve Enders, a software research analyst at Citi Research, told TechCrunch that one of the biggest challenges for the company in the consumer segment is the growing advancements coming from generative AI. A recent GPT-4 demo suggested that the solution would be ready to complete users’ taxes using its advanced algorithms. There has also been that nascent concern about competition in the overall tax market with reports of the U.S. expanding its free tax service, the analyst said referring a significant challenge for Intuit’s TurboTax. When asked about TurboTax, free services and whether AI would ever play a role in a new product from Intuit, Srivastava avoided a direct answer, claiming that AI in any form is intrinsic value to the company. “Sometimes there are prominent uses of AI, sometimes there are not. But either way, people know that we’re working to deliver value for them. And that’s what we’re known for, something I’m very proud of,” he said. Enders also pointed out that in the SMB segment, where Intuit targets QuickBooks, the company was moving into the mid-market, as well as trying to become more critical to its existing SMB customers by providing a broader portfolio of software solutions. In the credit segment where the company has Credit Karma, the analyst said the biggest challenge is macro-related, with tightened lending standards from banks leading to fewer financial products being sold to consumers. “I think there is always some risk of potential new competitors coming in, but Intuit should have a data and training set advantage given their dominant share in the tax and SMB accounting world,” he said. “Speed to market for some up and coming solutions may matter a bit more, particularly for CRM/marketing solutions in the SMB segment, but that is still a work in progress.” This is where those “revenue challenges” have also played out. Jester at BMO said that in the long term, it would be Intuit’s ability to harness its platforms to deepen relationships with customers and drive retention across the customer journey. As the AI revolution marches on, it will be exciting to see how Intuit continues to transform its business in the years to come and uses its resources from markets including India to develop competitive solutions effectively for the future.

379,The era of software-defined battery startups is here,['@tdechant'],"May 2, 2023","“Batteries are hard,” an expert once said. He wasn’t kidding. Designing and manufacturing pouches, slabs or cylinders filled with volatile chemicals that are capable of recharging ever more quickly is far from easy. Just ask LG, which had to pay GM nearly $2 billion for a costly manufacturing defect that saw every Chevy Bolt recalled. It gets even harder when you consider the realm of possibilities. There’s a range of materials that can store electrons and tweaking their amounts only expands the number of combinations. “Whenever you have a new battery that needs to be designed, there’s a huge design space, almost limitless design space,” Kaixiang Lin, co-founder and CEO of Chemix, told TechCrunch+. Years ago, new battery types were discovered by chemists laboring away at benches, testing different combinations. They were guided by an in-depth understanding of electrochemistry, decades of previous research and a hefty amount of intuition. They made great strides relying on that combination. But as batteries have spread throughout society, the need for new and specialized chemistries has only grown. Enter artificial intelligence. Battery companies have started to turn to machine learning to understand how batteries degrade over time, how they might charge faster and even which combination of materials might produce a better cell. The move toward specialization is creating more niches for startups. It’s also a transition that appears to be driving parts of the early-stage battery industry to behave more like the software sector: quick to scale, and possibly, quick to fail. Chemix is hoping that by building a company that’s entirely focused on applying AI to battery development, it’ll be able to create a moat that’s broad and deep enough to let it stay ahead of its competition. Lin and co-founder Jason Koeller, who serves as CTO, founded Chemix in 2021 and participated in UC Berkeley’s SkyDeck accelerator. Now, the company has raised a $10 million seed round from Mayfield Fund, Ibex Investors and Radical Ventures, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. Chemix is valued at $37 million post-money, according to PitchBook data. The company uses data and software to crank out novel cell designs that it hopes will allow it to serve a wide range of customers. Lin likened his company’s approach to Nvidia, which designs advanced logic chips while letting other companies (mainly TSMC) produce the physical product. “We focus on the high value-add step that is, I would say, the most challenging step: zero to one, how to come up with a battery design because of the limitless design space,” he said. “We basically leverage AI/ML to speed up the development process to find the most optimum design.” "
380,Hugging Face and ServiceNow release a free code-generating model,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"May 4, 2023","AI startup Hugging Face and ServiceNow Research, ServiceNow’s R&D division, have released StarCoder, a free alternative to code-generating AI systems along the lines of GitHub’s Copilot. Code-generating systems like DeepMind’s AlphaCode; Amazon’s CodeWhisperer; and OpenAI’s Codex, which powers Copilot, provide a tantalizing glimpse at what’s possible with AI within the realm of computer programming. Assuming the ethical, technical and legal issues are someday ironed out (and AI-powered coding tools don’t cause more bugs and security exploits than they solve), they could cut development costs substantially while allowing coders to focus on more creative tasks. According to a study from the University of Cambridge, at least half of developers’ efforts are spent debugging and not actively programming, which costs the software industry an estimated $312 billion per year. But so far, only a handful of code-generating AI systems have been made freely available to the public — reflecting the commercial incentives of the organizations building them (see: Replit). StarCoder, which by contrast is licensed to allow for royalty-free use by anyone, including corporations, was trained on over 80 programming languages as well as text from GitHub repositories, including documentation and programming notebooks. StarCoder integrates with Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code code editor and, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can follow basic instructions (e.g., “create an app UI”) and answer questions about code. Congratulations to all the @BigCodeProject contributors that worked tirelessly over the last 6+ months to bring the vision of releasing a responsibly developed 15B parameter Code LLM to fruition. We cannot thank you enough for the collaboration & contributions to the community. https://t.co/282sCRJq3k — ServiceNow Research (@ServiceNowRSRCH) May 4, 2023  Leandro von Werra, a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face and a co-lead on StarCoder, claims that StarCoder matches or outperforms the AI model from OpenAI that was used to power initial versions of Copilot. “One thing we learned from releases such as Stable Diffusion last year is the creativity and capability of the open-source community,” von Werra told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Within weeks of the release the community had built dozens of variants of the model as well as custom applications. Releasing a powerful code generation model allows anybody to fine-tune and adapt it to their own use-cases and will enable countless downstream applications.” StarCoder is a part of Hugging Face’s and ServiceNow’s over-600-person BigCode project, launched late last year, which aims to develop “state-of-the-art” AI systems for code in an “open and responsible” way. Hugging Face supplied an in-house compute cluster of 512 Nvidia V100 GPUs to train the StarCoder model. Various BigCode working groups focus on subtopics like collecting datasets, implementing methods for training code models, developing an evaluation suite and discussing ethical best practices. For example, the Legal, Ethics and Governance working group explored questions on data licensing, attribution of generated code to original code, the redaction of personally identifiable information (PII), and the risks of outputting malicious code. Inspired by Hugging Face’s previous efforts to open source sophisticated text-generating systems, BigCode seeks to address some of the controversies arising around the practice of AI-powered code generation. The nonprofit Software Freedom Conservancy among others has criticized GitHub and OpenAI for using public source code, not all of which is under a permissive license, to train and monetize Codex. Codex is available through OpenAI’s and Microsoft’s paid APIs, while GitHub recently began charging for access to Copilot. For their parts, GitHub and OpenAI assert that Codex and Copilot — protected by the doctrine of fair use, at least in the U.S. — don’t run afoul of any licensing agreements. “Releasing a capable code-generating system can serve as a research platform for institutions that are interested in the topic but don’t have the necessary resources or know-how to train such models,” von Werra said. “We believe that in the long run this leads to fruitful research on safety, capabilities and limits of code-generating systems.” Unlike Copilot, the 15-billion-parameter StarCoder was trained over the course of several days on an open source dataset called The Stack, which has over 19 million curated, permissively licensed repositories and more than six terabytes of code in over 350 programming languages. In machine learning, parameters are the parts of an AI system learned from historical training data and essentially define the skill of the system on a problem, such as generating code. A graphic breaking down the contents of The Stack dataset. Image Credits: BigCode A graphic breaking down the contents of The Stack dataset. Image Credits: BigCode Because it’s permissively licensed, code from The Stack can be copied, modified and redistributed. But the BigCode project also provides a way for developers to “opt out” of The Stack, similar to efforts elsewhere to let artists remove their work from text-to-image AI training datasets. The BigCode team also worked to remove PII from The Stack, such as names, usernames, email and IP addresses, and keys and passwords. They created a separate dataset of 12,000 files containing PII, which they plan to release to researchers through “gated access.” Beyond this, the BigCode team used Hugging Face’s malicious code detection tool to remove files from The Stack that might be considered “unsafe,” such as those with known exploits. The privacy and security issues with generative AI systems, which for the most part are trained on relatively unfiltered data from the web, are well-established. ChatGPT once volunteered a journalist’s phone number. And GitHub has acknowledged that Copilot may generate keys, credentials and passwords seen in its training data on novel strings. “Code poses some of the most sensitive intellectual property for most companies,” von Werra said. “In particular, sharing it outside their infrastructure poses immense challenges.” To his point, some legal experts have argued that code-generating AI systems could put companies at risk if they were to unwittingly incorporate copyrighted or sensitive text from the tools into their production software. As Elaine Atwell notes in a piece on Kolide’s corporate blog, because systems like Copilot strip code of its licenses, it’s difficult to tell which code is permissible to deploy and which might have incompatible terms of use. In response to the criticisms, GitHub added a toggle that lets customers prevent suggested code that matches public, potentially copyrighted content from GitHub from being shown. Amazon, following suit, has CodeWhisperer highlight and optionally filter the license associated with functions it suggests that bear a resemblance to snippets found in its training data. So what does ServiceNow, a company that deals mostly in enterprise automation software, get out of this? A “strong-performing model and a responsible AI model license that permits commercial use,” said Harm de Vries, the lead of the Large Language Model Lab at ServiceNow Research and the co-lead of the BigCode project. One imagines that ServiceNow will eventually build StarCoder into its commercial products. The company wouldn’t reveal how much, in dollars, it’s invested in the BigCode project, save that the amount of donated compute was “substantial.” “The Large Language Models Lab at ServiceNow Research is building up expertise on the responsible development of generative AI models to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of these powerful models for our customers,” de Vries said. “The open-scientific research approach to BigCode provides ServiceNow developers and customers with full transparency into how everything was developed and demonstrates ServiceNow’s commitment to making socially responsible contributions to the community.” StarCoder isn’t open source in the strictest sense. Rather, it’s being released under a licensing scheme, OpenRAIL-M, that includes “legally enforceable” use case restrictions that derivatives of the model — and apps using the model — are required to comply with. For example, StarCoder users must agree not to leverage the model to generate or distribute malicious code. While real-world examples are few and far between (at least for now), researchers have demonstrated how AI like StarCoder could be used in malware to evade basic forms of detection. Whether developers actually respect the terms of the license remains to be seen. Legal threats aside, there’s nothing at the base technical level to prevent them from disregarding the terms to their own ends. That’s what happened with the aforementioned Stable Diffusion, whose similarly restrictive license was ignored by developers who used the generative AI model to create pictures of celebrity deepfakes. But the possibility hasn’t discouraged von Werra, who feels the downsides of not releasing StarCoder aren’t outweighed by the upsides. “At launch, StarCoder will not ship as many features as GitHub Copilot, but with its open-source nature, the community can help improve it along the way as well as integrate custom models,” he said. The StarCoder code repositories, model training framework, dataset-filtering methods, code evaluation suite and research analysis notebooks are available on GitHub as of this week. The BigCode project will maintain them going forward as the groups look to develop more capable code-generating models, fueled by input from the community. There’s certainly work to be done. In the technical paper accompanying StarCoder’s release, Hugging Face and ServiceNow say that the model may produce inaccurate, offensive, and misleading content as well as PII and malicious code that managed to make it past the dataset filtering stage."
381,Niu’s latest scooter falls short on built-for-the-city promise,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 4, 2023","The Niu Technologies KQi3 Max has the kind of specs that should make it the ideal scooter for urban dwellers — especially those who live in hilly terrain. The 46.5-pound scooter has enough power to whisk riders through city streets at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour, handle steep hills and take sharp turns, all while managing a range of 40 miles. And yet, the Niu Technologies KQi3 Max lacks some key features that its city-dwelling consumer base will want. After a month of testing the KQi3 Max, I found the scooter had plenty of zip, power and battery range. But it missed the mark on sturdiness, safety and security features and weight — areas that one would expect to be covered for the $999 price. Niu has other versions of the KQi3 in its range, including the Sport ($699, top speed 17.4 mph) and the Pro ($799, top speed 19.9 mph). As someone who covers transportation, I’ve generally supported the idea that micromobility has the potential to transform the way we move, particularly through cities. Since my move from New York to Auckland, New Zealand, I have been seeking a micromobility unicorn in a car-filled forest.  Auckland’s hilly and sprawling landscape combined with sparse bike lanes and inconsistent public transit has made a 2009 Nissan March my go-to form of transportation — a surprising shift for this native New Yorker.  E-bikes would be an ideal solution to at least curb my reliance on a car that is on the cusp of some expensive repairs. But the high cost of e-bikes — due to New Zealand’s reliance on imports — makes it a challenging proposition. E-scooters could, in theory, provide me (and other city folks) a cheaper alternative to e-bikes for the purposes of at least getting to and from work and social engagements. So when Niu offered to send me a KQi3, which it deemed to be “the safest electric scooter,” I was intrigued. Could I, someone who doesn’t always feel safe on e-scooters, replace my car with one in a city like Auckland? The TL;DR is: Yes, but maybe not the KQi3.   Niu promises the KQi3 Max is a “city on your doorstep.” And in many ways, it delivers. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan Niu promises the KQi3 Max is a “city on your doorstep.” And in many ways, it delivers. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan The KQi3 Max is equipped with an electric motor that packs 450 watts of power, a 608 kilowatt-hour battery that can travel 40 miles on a single charge and dual disc brakes in the front and rear. That combo allows the scooter to reach an impressive top speed of 20 miles per hour, which it easily achieves on flat ground or when going down hill. The powerful motor also means it can scale hills at more than a crawl, usually at about 9 mph to 14 mph depending on steepness. The range on the KQi3, which is double some of its competitors, is also boosted by regenerative braking that pumps energy back into the battery. Once that battery is empty, however, expect it to take about eight hours to charge.  There are also bright front and rear LED lights, side reflectors and an LED display that clearly shows the speed at which you’re riding, how much charge you’ve got and a tantalizing suggestion of connecting the scooter to your phone via Bluetooth. Alas, the Bluetooth feature never worked despite my multiple attempts (more on that later).  The scooter also folds, a sought-after feature for those living in apartments and one that suggests that it is portable. And therein lies one of the KQi3 Max’s shortfalls. The scooter isn’t just heavy at 46.5 pounds, it also lacks a handle. In other words, this scooter isn’t going anywhere easily. And if you live in an apartment that lacks an elevator or want to try and take this scooter on a bus, good luck. (To compare another scooter I’ve tried recently, the Taur also folds, but weighs 38 pounds, is easily carried by its neck and can stand vertically when folded.) The Niu KQi3 Max e-scooter has front and rear braking, a bell and an LED display. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan The Niu KQi3 Max e-scooter has front and rear braking, a bell and an LED display. Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan I write for TechCrunch, so I’m not a luddite, and I know how to troubleshoot. But after an hour of searching Reddit posts, binding and unbinding the scooter to the app, deleting and redownloading the app, I gave up trying to connect the two via Bluetooth. This meant that I was unable to test certain features, like the ability to lock the scooter from my phone. Without that, there is no obvious way to ensure that someone on the street doesn’t just hit the ON button and ride off. The shape of these vehicles really doesn’t lend itself to a bike lock situation (although a U-lock might work), so you really do want a smart locking or anti-theft technology.  Without that Bluetooth connection, the app was rendered useless to me, particularly when alerts in Chinese popped up. I didn’t feel like I was missing out on too many other features, though. The app also displays rider stats, but if I’m not breaking a sweat and paring the data with my Fitbit, I definitely don’t care how many miles I’ve ridden.  Users can also use the app to access and switch the four rider modes: E-Save, Sport, Pedestrian and Custom. Three of the modes are also accessible on the scooter. Custom was only available through the app, which meant I was unable to test that mode. I rode mostly in Sport because it was the fastest. The default mode is E-Save, which only allows you to ride up to about 9 miles per hour. The acceleration in that mode is less jolty, though, and since it reins in the torque, E-Save mode helps increase battery life. Without the help of an app, Pedestrian mode was hard to figure out (FYI you get there by pressing the ON button five times, something I figured out through Reddit), but I never felt the need to use it. Its sole purpose is to slow riders down to walking speed, 5 miles per hour, just in case you can’t trust yourself to slow down around pedestrians.  What stands out the most about the KQi3 Max is its speed. I found that it took me the same amount of time to scoot as it would to drive, but with none of the feelings of guilt about being one small person hauling around a 2,000-pound machine. However, for such a heavy scooter (about 46.5 pounds — try lugging that up your fifth-floor walkup!), it didn’t feel particularly sturdy on the road, despite the comfortable, wide foot base and the 75-degree tilt to the neck, which is supposed to make it more stable. The handlebars shook anytime I encountered uneven roads and the 9.5-inch tires felt too small for many of Auckland’s sidewalk ramps. The acceleration in Sport mode was perhaps even too effective, often throwing me back a bit. The front wheel lifted off the ground more than once as I accelerated. Braking produced a similar joltiness. I became accustomed to the way the KQi3 rode with time, but at high speeds and while sharing the road with cars, stability is one of those must-have items.  Maybe you’re reading this thinking, Well, she just doesn’t sound like a confident rider. That’s not the scooter’s fault. If so, you and my partner have something in common. So I asked him to ride the scooter to work and let me know what he thought.  “I actually see what you mean about the safety concerns,” he texted me later that morning. “It’s pretty unstable, even with both hands, and close to impossible to take one hand off to do any kind of adjustment to headphones or pocket etc.” I had a similar fear of removing one hand, which meant I couldn’t signal to cars behind me when I wanted to turn. This scooter (probably all scooters) would massively improve with turn signals. My partner, who is a cyclist and confident road user, also said the roads were a little wet when he rode, so braking was “very precarious.” He said when braking at over 14 miles per hour, the wheels locked and started skidding out.  It is possible that there was a problem with the individual scooter that I tested, because I’ve seen other reviews online that praise the KQi3’s excellent brakes and its ability to handle most road types.  My pros and cons for the KQi3 Max are deeply tied to what I — a 31-year-old woman who lives and works in a sprawling, hilly city and occasionally uses stairs — would be looking for in a scooter. The number one thing is feeling safe, which wasn’t always the case with this one. Second is speed and ease of movement, which the KQi3 definitely achieved. Third is something lightweight and easy to carry up and down stairs, so the scooter left something to be desired there. Fourth is a good intelligent system that offers a way to lock the scooter and prevent theft. While Niu does claim to offer this, I was unable to confirm that offering. All up, the KQi3 Max ticks some of my boxes, but not all of them."
382,NationsBenefits confirms thousands had personal data stolen in Fortra breach,['@zackwhittaker'],"April 19, 2023","Another corporate giant has confirmed thousands of healthcare members had information stolen in the cyberattack targeting Fortra customers. Florida-based technology company NationsBenefits said in a data breach notice filed with New Hampshire’s attorney general that more than 7,100 state residents had their personal information stolen in the late-January ransomware attack on Fortra’s systems. NationsBenefits provides supplemental benefits for health insurance members, such as vision, hearing and over-the-counter drugs. The data breach notice said hackers stole personal information of NationsBenefits members stored in its Fortra-hosted instance of GoAnywhere, a file-transfer software tool used by thousands of organizations to share large sets of data over the internet. Hackers used a previously unknown vulnerability to raid dozens of customer GoAnywhere instances hosted by Fortra in the January mass-hack. The Clop ransomware gang claimed responsibility, alleging it stole data on more than a hundred organizations. When reached by TechCrunch, NationsBenefits spokesperson Michael Fried declined to say what specific data was stolen in the incident, adding that the company is “complying with all legal and commercial obligations in response to this incident.” It’s not known how many individuals residing outside of New Hampshire are affected. NationsBenefits also filed a data breach notice in California, but companies are not obligated under the state’s law to disclose how many residents are affected by a data breach. Companies typically have to disclose data breaches in California when 500 residents or more are affected. NationsBenefits has more than 20 million members across the United States. When asked, the company’s spokesperson declined to say how many of its millions of members are affected by the breach. The healthcare benefits company is the latest Fortra customer to confirm it was affected by the January breach. U.S. healthcare giant Community Health Systems was the first confirmed victim and one of the worst affected, with the hackers claiming to have stolen data on at least 1 million patients. Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, healthcare program provider US Wellness, investment giant Onex, the U.K.’s Pension Protection Fund, Brightline, and the City of Toronto have all confirmed data thefts following the hack. Fortra has faced criticism for its poor handling of the breach, which included hiding details of the zero-day exploit behind a customer login wall. News of the breach only came to light when security reporter Brian Krebs published the company’s hidden disclosure online. Fortra patched the vulnerability a week later. TechCrunch reported that Fortra told some customers that their data was safe, only to find that their data was stolen after hackers sent a ransom demand. NationsBenefits acknowledged in its statement that “only after we contacted Fortra did they confirm the existence of the vulnerability.” In its first public acknowledgment of the breach, Fortra said in a blog post Tuesday that customers running their own on-premise server were hacked almost two weeks before Fortra’s hosted systems were compromised. Fortra spokesperson Rachel Woodford declined to say how many customers are affected or comment beyond the company’s blog post.  "
383,Alibaba founder Jack Ma returns to China after a year of uncertainty,['@ritacyliao'],"March 27, 2023","Jack Ma’s whereabouts are making headlines again, roughly a year after the billionaire founder of Alibaba disappeared from the public eye. Ma had chosen to stay abroad despite China’s efforts to restore confidence in entrepreneurs, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Within hours, however, it seems Ma actually visited an Alibaba-funded K-12 school in Hangzhou, according to an article published by the school, Yungu. The Bloomberg article had since been updated to reflect Ma’s appearance in Hangzhou, which is home to the founder and Alibaba. He reportedly talked about how ChatGPT posed a challenge to education during the visit. Interest in Ma’s whereabouts has renewed recently, given that China is trying to voice support for the private sector following a years-long crackdown on the tech industry, including shelving the IPO plans of Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba. The movement prompted some founders to move abroad and seek to expand their businesses overseas. The news comes as Chinese tech firms are facing unprecedented pressure in the West. Last Thursday, U.S. lawmakers grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a congressional hearing that spanned five hours, firing harsh questions that brought to light the irreconcilable differences between the two superpowers. The hearing, as one Chinese founder said to TechCrunch, sent a chill up their spine. TikTok isn’t the only one running into roadblocks in the U.S. A group of “businesses and individuals” have formed a “Shut Down Shein” campaign to question the business practices of Shein, the Singapore-headquartered fast fashion giant that has risen to global dominance thanks to its data-driven supply chains in China. Shein refuted a report that it faced risks of being shut down in the U.S.      "
384,Let’s talk about ‘Mrs. Davis’ and the show’s wild approach to AI,['@laurenforristal'],"April 18, 2023","Set in an alt-near future reality, Peacock’s newest original series, “Mrs. Davis,” releasing on April 20, is edging toward being a little too believable — minus the kidnapping Germans, an elusive Holy Grail and a life-threatening venture inside a gargantuan whale. The show centers around an all-knowing AI that’s designed to satisfy its users, sending them on quests that give them a sense of purpose and making them feel like all their problems are finally solved. We spoke with “Mrs. Davis” co-creators, Damon Lindelof and Tara Hernandez, to find out more about why they were inspired to film a show where AI wants to control our lives. Lindelof, the co-creator of “Lost,” and Hernandez, mainly known for her work on “The Big Bang Theory,” were introduced to each other during the peak of COVID and brainstormed ideas that would eventually become “Mrs. Davis.” The showrunners pointed out that the show was dreamed up three years before ChatGPT launched to the public. “It’s really interesting. Not that we were ahead of the curve, but it’s sort of…taking it to the next level. As you’re well aware, [AI] is moving at a pretty quantum rate right now,” Lindelof told us. Initially, the co-creators had thought about centering the show’s conflict around an app that could help determine which COVID activities were safe and those that were not, according to the latest COVID rules. They then spiraled further and thought up an app that could provide relationship advice, professional guidance and — as crazy as it sounds — replaces religion altogether. This then evolved into the “Mrs. Davis” AI. Lindelof mentioned to us that he consumed a lot of news related to AI and listened to podcasts like “Rabbit Hole,” which talks about how the internet impacts our lives. The book, “You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How AI Works and Why It’s Making the World a Weirder Place” by Janelle Shane also came out around the same time they were writing the show, which both Lindelof and Hernandez enjoyed reading. (Shane is an optics research scientist and AI researcher who runs a humor blog called AI Weirdness.) “It felt like the writer sort of had this relationship with her algorithm and would teach it things and it felt not unlike raising a pet, you know, and a really funny one at that,” said Hernandez. “So, I think that really informed us that algorithms could be super dumb and silly and that we found delight in the fact when they are because it makes us feel a little better about our position in society.” Hernandez and Lindelof also selected people with diverse backgrounds to help write the show, including those with experience in tech. “Once we got the green light to continue with our initial pitch, we put together a writer’s room, and we made sure that the backgrounds and the experiences of our writers were unlike our own,” Hernandez added. “We had Jonny Sun, a writer who goes to MIT, and Nadra Widatalla comes from a gaming background…they really became our guides in these worlds that we, ourselves were maybe unfamiliar with.” Sun is a Ph.D. candidate at MIT with a background in machine learning and evolutionary robotics. Not only did Sun help expand plot points and write a few episodes for the show, but he also developed an algorithm that generated episode titles. “We would feed [the algorithm] an episode synopsis in the prompt box, like here’s three or four sentences about what happens in episode three of ‘Mrs. Davis.’ And then the script for that episode. So this algorithm can actually read and understand what a story was and then give us a title,” Lindelof explained to TechCrunch. “But then we realized it didn’t know what a title was… there were titles that were 35 words or 100 words.” It ultimately took months to program, and Sun trained several models before the team landed on a favorite algorithm. “It made up its own language… episode two features these Germans, so there’s [a title] that sounds like it could be German,” Hernandez said. “We are big fans of the strange, weird and just almost-right-but-indecipherably-wrong ‘unhuman’ quality of algorithmically generated language, and wanted our episode titles to feel that way, reflecting the weirdness of ‘Mrs. Davis’ and the uncanny, surreal, but also poignant, tone of our series.” Some examples of AI-generated episode titles include: (The following part of this TechCrunch story may contain spoilers.) Artificial intelligence has come a long way since machine learning and is becoming increasingly embedded in our daily lives. With the snowballing ubiquity of algorithms and the current rise of generative AI tools, the show certainly addresses a timely topic. After watching all eight episodes of Mrs. Davis, we have to say it’s one of the wackier shows that we’ve seen in a long time. We won’t reveal too much, but let’s just say it made our brains hurt a little. (But in a good way, we suppose?) In this “Black Mirror”-esque show, Mrs. Davis has seemingly eliminated the need for social media apps, distracting its four billion users from the world’s issues with a gamified reward system. It sends its users out on quests until they eventually earn their “wings,” which provide a sense of status (much like a verification mark). These wings are almost impossible to get, which is why Mrs. Davis offers a shortcut. If a user wants instant wings, they must give it their life. Cue dramatic, dystopian music. Image Credits: Peacock Image Credits: Peacock TechCrunch spoke with the main cast, which includes Betty Gilpin (Sister Simon), Jake McDorman (Wiley), and Chris Diamantopoulos (JQ). All three characters have personal vendettas against Mrs. D. Sister Simone, the protagonist, is a nun that hates the algorithm because it took away her parents’ livelihood and — in her eyes — is responsible for her father’s death. Before the algorithm was created, Simone’s parents were magicians. However, Mrs. Davis took away the curiosity behind magic since it gave users all the answers. Consumed with vengeance, Simone teams up with a resistance group to try and destroy it. Throughout the show, we see Mrs. D speaking to Simone through its cult-like followers (a.k.a. users). Every time Mrs. D wants to tell her something, the user asks Simone if they can “proxy” or repeat what the algorithm is saying through their earphones. We asked Gilpin what she thought about algorithms and AI before the show and what she thinks of them now. “Before we were filming and even when we were filming, ChatGPT wasn’t really a thing… It wasn’t in the headlines like it is now,” Gilpin told us. “Now I have a pretty healthy fear of it, where I used to think it was sort of this niche thing that smarter people than I am were interested in. I think now I’m sort of asking the same question that Simone asks in the series, which is, ‘Is this an incredible thing for society or is this poison?’ I don’t know.” “I understand the impulse in a world where, particularly in the pandemic when we had so many questions and no answers…to follow something that purports to have all the answers. But that’s against the purpose of being alive…having a robot try to sidestep those moments in life for us… It may be helpful in curing disease, but in terms of interfering with human interaction and being existential, being a person of faith or the intangible, I don’t think those are things that I’m willing to give up,” she added. Betty Gilpin as Simone. Image Credits: Sophie Kohler/Peacock Betty Gilpin as Simone. Image Credits: Sophie Kohler/Peacock Like Simone, Wiley and JQ are also personally affected by Mrs. D and dedicate their lives to ending the algorithm once and for all. Wiley, who is Simone’s ex-boyfriend, leads this resistance group, alongside his friend and confidant, JQ. They enlist a team of tech nerds to build an off-grid, “top-secret” hideout equipped with an advanced server that — to their knowledge — Mrs. Davis can’t access. There’s even a bit throughout the series where Wiley and JQ have an endless supply of burner flip phones, breaking them after every single call to avoid suspicion. (Albeit wasteful, it’s also hilarious.) “It’s a physical manifestation of the paranoia that ‘The Big D’ is everywhere, and in order to avoid and to continually scramble and make sure that [Mrs. Davis] is not anywhere intercepting any of these calls or ahead of us, we break the phone to break a signal after the call is done,” Diamantopoulos told us. “It’s like in those old World War II movies when the French Resistance would meet under candlelight in a small bar somewhere in like north of Berlin, and they’d have the names of these German generals written on a piece of paper, and then they’d light a cigarette and light it on fire,” he explained. What’s so great about this show is that it never takes itself too seriously, whether that’s how it portrays Mrs. D or all the outrageous tasks the AI assigns to Simone and Wiley. “When I got the script, it was clear that this was like five different genres in one,” McDorman said. “There were elements of an adventure story, science fiction, obviously with an algorithm, a little bit of a rom-com, definitely comedy and also drama. I think I said this to Damon [Lindelof] — and I mean this in the best way — it’s like a game of Mad Libs that just got out of control. So yeah, something that’s that unique and that original and not afraid to take big swings like that is obviously exciting and rare to come across.” Diamantopoulos as JQ (left) and McDorman as Wiley (right). Image Credits: Peacock Diamantopoulos as JQ (left) and McDorman as Wiley (right). Image Credits: Peacock The show takes us down many theme-driven roads, including religion, spirituality, toxic masculinity and some serious mommy issues. However, the central theme focuses on how technology rules our lives. However, Lindelof and Hernandez want to add that “Mrs. Davis” isn’t an anti-technology show. It is only meant to encourage viewers to talk about it. “Mrs. Davis was always intended to provoke discussion. To be an exploration. To ask the question: Is this really good for us? Is this helping me or hurting me? Which is why it felt like such a natural pairing to center the series on a nun — who is also going through the same kind of exploration as it relates to her faith,” said Hernandez. Peacock will release the first four episodes of Mrs. Davis on April 20.  "
385,"Hackers used spyware made in Spain to target users in the UAE, Google says","['Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai', 'Carly Page']","March 29, 2023","In November 2022, Google revealed the existence of a then-unknown spyware vendor called Variston. Now, Google researchers say they have seen hackers use Variston’s tools in the United Arab Emirates. In a report published on Wednesday, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said it discovered hackers targeting people in the UAE who used Samsung’s native Android browser, which is a customized version of Chromium. The hackers used a set of vulnerabilities chained together and delivered via one-time web links sent to the targets by text message. Of the four vulnerabilities in the chain, two were zero-days at the time of the attack, meaning they had not been reported to the software maker and were unknown at that point, according to the new blog post by TAG. If a target clicked on the malicious web links, they would have been directed to a landing page “identical to the one TAG examined in the Heliconia framework developed by commercial spyware vendor Variston.” (Both campaigns used the same exact and unique landing page, Google told TechCrunch. Once exploited the victim would have been infected with “a fully featured Android spyware suite” designed to capture data from chat and browser apps, according to the post. “The actor using the exploit chain to target UAE users may be a customer or partner of Variston, or otherwise working closely with the spyware vendor,” the blog post read. It’s unclear who is behind the hacking campaign or who the victims are. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that TAG observed about 10 malicious web links in the wild. Some of the links redirected to StackOverflow after exploitation and may have been the attacker’s test devices, Google said. TAG said it wasn’t clear who was behind the hacking campaign. Samsung spokesperson Chris Langlois said that the company has “already taken necessary steps to prevent these potential exploit chains by issuing patches for the Samsung Internet app in December 2022.” “December’s updates to the Samsung Internet app disable entry points for the remaining vulnerabilities and ensure devices are protected. We are actively collaborating with our partners to release patches for the remaining vulnerabilities as early as possible, starting in April, and recommend all users keep their devices updated with the latest software to ensure the highest level of protection possible,” Langlois said. Ralf Wegener and Ramanan Jayaraman are the founders of Variston, according to Intelligence Online, an online news publication that covers the surveillance industry. The two owned half of the company each in 2018, according to Spanish business records. Neither founder responded to a request for comment. Variston is headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. According to business registration records in Italy, Variston acquired the Italian zero-day research company Truel in 2018. The hacking campaign in the UAE was discovered by Amnesty International’s Security Lab. In a press release, Amnesty said that the campaign has been active since at least 2020 and targeted both mobile phones and computers. Amnesty said they observed the exploits being delivered by a network of more than 1,000 malicious domains, “including domains spoofing media websites in multiple countries.” The organization also said they observed traces of the campaign in Indonesia, Belarus, the UAE and Italy, but these countries “likely represent only a small subset of the overall attack campaign based on the extensive nature of the wider attack infrastructure.” Google also said on Wednesday that it discovered hackers exploiting an iOS zero-day bug, patched in November, to remotely plant spyware on users’ devices. The researchers say they observed attackers abusing the security flaw as part of an exploit chain targeting iPhone owners running iOS 15.1 and older located in Italy, Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The flaw was found in the WebKit browser engine that powers Safari and other apps, and was first discovered and reported by Google TAG researchers. Apple patched the bug in December, confirming at the time that the company was aware that the vulnerability was actively exploited “against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.1.” Hackers also used a second iOS vulnerability described as a PAC bypass technique that was fixed by Apple in March 2022, which Google researchers say is the exact technique used by North Macedonian spyware developer Cytrox to install its Predator spyware. Citizen Lab previously released a report highlighting widespread government use of the Predator spyware. Google also observed hackers exploiting a chain of three Android bugs targeting devices running an ARM-based graphics chip, including one zero-day. Google said ARM released a fix, but several vendors — including Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo and Google itself — did not incorporate the patch, resulting in “a situation where attackers were able to freely exploit the bug for several months,” Google said. The discovery of these new hacking campaigns is “a reminder that the commercial spyware industry continues to thrive, says Google. “Even smaller surveillance vendors have access to 0-days, and vendors stockpiling and using 0-day vulnerabilities in secret poses a severe risk to the Internet.” “These campaigns may also indicate that exploits and techniques are being shared between surveillance vendors, enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools,” the blog read. This story has been updated with a statement from Amnesty International, and Samsung.  "
386,Dabbsson’s new Home Backup Power Station is here to keep your lights on,['@Haje'],"April 19, 2023","What do you do when the lights go out? When the snow became too much for the power lines as a kid, I remember candles and Primus stoves. In today’s world of high-tech electrification, we’re going in a slightly different direction and Dabbsson today announced its new Portable Home Backup Power Ecosystem, which harnesses the charging and storage technology from electric vehicles to ensure that you won’t be without energy in a blackout. Dabbsson’s Portable Home Backup Power Ecosystem comprises three elements: First, there is the Portable Home Backup Power Station. It has a base capacity of 2,330Wh, which is expandable to 8,330Wh, with a 2,200 watt steady power delivery, and can deliver up to 4400 watts worth of surge output. Second comes the Smart Expandable Battery. Up to two expandable batteries can increase the Portable Home Backup Power Station’s capacity to 5,330Wh and 8,330Wh, with one and two additional batteries, respectively. Finally there’s a solar panel. The system can be charged via multiple means — from AC power in around two hours, but to ensure that batteries remain charged whatever the duration of a blackout, compatible solar charging panels are available. Modular solar options range from 200W to 3,000W, covering the needs of most households.   Dabbsson states that its Portable Home Backup Power System can power up to 15 devices simultaneously. The company claims this makes it 30% more powerful than traditional products of the same capacity. “As our world continues to face new and unpredictable energy challenges and disruptions, we’re committed to helping consumers and their families feel safer and more secure with reliable, high-performance power solutions,” said Sam Lam, head of Global Markets at Dabbsson in a statement to TechCrunch. I’ve been testing out the power station and an additional battery, along with the company’s 200W solar panel. The overall system isn’t quite as powerful or flexible as a full-house battery system, but it’s certainly a lot more powerful than the smaller, more portable solutions that are flooding the market from all directions. “Our vision is to introduce new innovations in decentralized home energy, with modular and renewable energy options to suit every household,” said Lam. “We want to provide sustainable alternatives to consumers who are committed to reducing their carbon footprint while increasing their energy autonomy — without sacrificing on performance or reliability.” For Dabbsson, these portable power solutions are the first step in its plans to expand decentralized energy provision, with the aim being for households and apartments to run entirely off-grid."

389,"Snapchat sees spike in 1-star reviews as users pan the ‘My AI’ feature, calling for its removal",['@sarahintampa'],"April 24, 2023","The user reviews for Snapchat’s “My AI” feature are in — and they’re not good. Launched last week to global users after initially being a subscriber-only addition, Snapchat’s new AI chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology is now pinned to the top of the app’s Chat tab where users can ask it questions and get instant responses. But following the chatbot’s rollout to Snapchat’s wider community, Snapchat’s app has seen a spike in negative reviews amid a growing number of complaints shared on social media. Over the past week, Snapchat’s average U.S. App Store review was 1.67, with 75% of reviews being one-star, according to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. For comparison, across Q1 2023, the Snapchat average U.S. App Store review was 3.05, with only 35% of reviews being one-star. The number of daily reviews has also increased by five times over the last week, the firm noted. Another app data provider, Apptopia, reports a similar trend. Its analysis shows “AI” was the top keyword in Snapchat’s App Store reviews over the past seven days, where it was mentioned 2,973 times. The firm has given the term an “Impact Score” rating of -9.2. This Impact Score is a weighted index that measures the effect a term has on sentiment and ranges from -10 to +10. Apptopia also said that Snapchat received around 3x more one-star ratings than usual on April 20, 2023. That’s the day after the My AI global release was announced. Now, the number of one-star reviews is starting to come down a bit, but they still remain elevated. Image Credits: Apptopia (analysis of Snapchat app ratings) Image Credits: Apptopia (analysis of Snapchat app ratings) The backlash against Snapchat’s My AI comes at a time when the hype around AI is at an inflection point. Companies are weighing how to integrate AI into their businesses, not if they should. For Snap, the addition of an AI chatbot to its social app would have been thought to be a smart move, as dozens of AI chatbot apps are filling the app stores, raking in millions of dollars — a signal that could easily be interpreted to indicate growing consumer demand for social AI chat experiences. But many Snapchat users aren’t thrilled with My AI, which appeared inside their app without warning or their consent. Image Credits: Snapchat screenshot Image Credits: Snapchat screenshot To some extent, it’s the chatbot’s placement that’s the cause of concern. My AI is pinned to the top of users’ Chat feed inside the app and can’t be unpinned, blocked or removed, as other conversations can be. This feed is where Snapchat users have regular interactions with friends and isn’t necessarily a place they want to toy around with experimental features. Plus, Snapchat already has an established presence in this feed with its own “Team Snapchat” chats, and now it’s doubling the screen real estate it wants to take for itself — or, at least, that’s how some users see it. It’s not difficult to find complaints about the My AI feature on social media. A simple search for “My AI” on Twitter, for instance, will reveal numerous results. Users are also sharing their complaints with Snapchat directly. After announcing the new chatbot in a tweet last week during Snap’s Partner Summit event, users took the replies to cite their grievances. Can we have the option to delete it? Asking for the majority of us who didn’t request this feature — ¿Bebé, Tré fue? (@tremcleod_) April 19, 2023  In dozens of responses to Snap’s tweet, users are fully panning the AI bot. They’re saying it should be opt-in only or that they should be given the option to remove it, instead of having it forced upon them. Some users are so upset they’re even threatening to quit Snapchat over this and delete the app entirely. Many are also pushing back at the fact that removing the My AI from their Chat feed requires a Snapchat+ subscription. According to Snap’s own documentation, Snapchat+ subscribers will receive early access to new My AI features and have the ability to unpin My AI or remove it from their Chats. This angers people who now feel like they’re being forced to pay Snapchat after it messed up their app with an unwanted feature.   Not only do users find the AI feature invasive, some find it creepy, as well. They’re surprised to learn that Snapchat’s AI knows their location, for example, and can use that information in its responses, even if they’re not sharing their location on the Snap Map. In a way, the AI bot is surfacing the level of personal data collection that social media companies do in the background, and putting it directly in front of the consumer. As it turns out, that’s not a great selling point when the users don’t feel they’ve specifically opted in to share that data with the AI. This speaks to a larger debate now taking place around AI, as people are waking up to the fact that it’s our own data and our labor in creating information for the web that has allowed these AI systems to come into existence in the first place. Modern AIs are trained on large data sources, including those they licensed but also on publicly available data on the internet and our personal information. This post on fb is so creepy!! Absolutely just no, we don’t want it ‼️ pic.twitter.com/TsPYeOtAmO — Madison Carroll (@MadisonCarroll0) April 21, 2023  In addition, Snapchat’s My AI had already been the subject of serious concerns before its public rollout. While available as a subscriber-only feature, The Washington Post reported the bot was responding in an unsafe manner. After telling the bot the user was a 15-year-old, the AI made suggestions about how to mask the smell of alcohol and pot at a birthday party. It also wrote an essay for school for the teen. When the bot was told the user was 13, it responded to a question about how to set the mood when having sex for the first time, the paper reported. Snap downplayed the claims at the time, saying some people had tried to “trick the chatbot into providing responses that do not conform to our guidelines.” However, it then rolled out new tools including age filters to keep the AI responses more age-appropriate, and promised parental controls were on the way. Those parental controls were still not available at the time of My AI’s public launch and Snap gave no update as to when they could be expected. Despite the numerous complaints, there were a handful of dissenters to the backlash over My AI. “Am I the only one who loves it?,” asked one user in the replies to Snapchat’s tweet. Only one person responded to them, saying just “yo.” Image Credits: Sensor Tower (analysis of Snapchat app reviews) Image Credits: Sensor Tower (analysis of Snapchat app reviews) Digging into the negative review spike, it becomes clear that Snapchat’s app ratings don’t even tell the full story here. A chart from Sensor Tower, for instance, shows that five-star reviews also spiked over the past few days alongside the one-star reviews where users were complaining about the My AI feature. That would lead one to believe that the AI feature is divisive, as opposed to being widely panned. But a closer inspection of those five-star reviews indicates that many of them also include My AI complaints. For example, one threatens “Get rid of AI. Or I will change my review to a one star. Nobody at all wants AI on Snapchat.” Image Credits: Sensor Tower (analysis of Snapchat app reviews) Image Credits: Sensor Tower (analysis of Snapchat app reviews) Several other five-star reviews demand to block the AI or remove it, call it creepy or “crap” and yet the user has still rated the app five stars. It’s unclear if that’s due to user error, issues with Sensor Tower analysis or something else. In any event, a number of these “5-star” reviews should be considered negative reviews or complaints, based on their actual commentary. Still, scrolling through the App Store reviews sorted by “Most Recent” shows how many complaints there are. Nearly all the new reviews have something to say about My AI, and the majority are not good. https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RPReplay_Final1682349613.mp4 Snapchat declined to comment on the situation but noted that Snapchat+ users sent nearly 2 million chats to the AI while in early testing. The company says it’s constantly iterating on Snapchat’s features based on the community’s feedback but did not commit to removing the AI. Instead, a Snapchat spokesperson said if users didn’t like the AI feature, they don’t have to use it.  "

391,"Despite uncertain US future, TikTok launches Branded Effects for marketers",['@sarahintampa'],"March 27, 2023","While the U.S. government debates TikTok’s future following last week’s congressional hearing, the video entertainment platform today announced a new product called Branded Effects aimed at businesses marketing themselves on its platform. The solution will allow brands to collaborate with TikTok effect creators to design custom effects — like AR experiences and other interactive features — to accompany their online campaigns and marketing efforts. The solution, Effect House Branded Effects, is an extension of TikTok’s existing development platform Effect House, launched roughly a year ago. With Effect House, the company had put the tools needed to develop AR effects into creators’ hands, allowing them to extend TikTok’s existing AR effect library — a competitive feature for its app. The suite also includes other things AR effect creators would need to get started, like templates, tutorials, and documentation that explains how to create specific types of effects, like Segmentation, Face Mask, Head Tracker, Face Stretch and 3D Face, as well as how to use different textures, materials, lighting and shadows, and more.   Now, with the launch of Branded Effects, businesses can begin to work with TikTok’s top effect creators to build out effects for the brand’s social media and online campaigns that also include specific features, like calls-to-action or custom audience targeting, among other things. Brands can use Branded Effects to engage users in a number of ways, like offering ways to virtually try-on makeup, change the user’s hair color, have them put on a hat, overlay a sticker or frame onto the video, follow dance moves, use head movements to steer a vehicle, unlock animations by scanning images, text or objects in real life and more. The company suggests the product makes sense for a range of businesses, including brands working in spaces like personal care, beauty, consumer packaged goods, entertainment and retail. TikTok says Branded Effects also allow the brand to boost their content to a wider audience through things like paid branding traffic solutions and can place their effects in premium placements on the effect panel’s “Trending” tab for greater visibility. In addition, TikTok says all its ad formats support showcasing the Branded Effects and can drive viewers to the app’s Effects Page, where the Branded Effect could then be selected with a tap. Brands are also able to control what brand-safe videos appear on the effect’s detail page to ensure that only appropriate or positive videos are showcased when TikTok users look up the effect on the app to see how other people are using it. “We’ve seen brands use effects on TikTok in all kinds of creative ways to reach new audiences, share stories, and build community,” said Greg Feingold, Effect House Community Lead, in a statement. “By working with top Effect House creators to create effects, brands can further harness the creativity and authenticity of the TikTok community.” TikTok noted that Microsoft was among the businesses already using effects to reach TikTok’s online community. In a blog post, TikTok said that Microsoft 365’s agency Superdigital had leveraged Effect House to create the WordArt You effect in partnership with Effect House creators Eddy Adams (@eddyin3d) and Jan Trejo (@janmahavan), which resulted in 126,000 TikTok videos featuring the effect and millions of views. Another early adopter, Mucinex, ran a Branded Effect campaign that saw a 42.7% lift in purchase intent, according to an online case study. Other Branded Effect testers included beauty brand Laneige, gum maker Dirol, Netflix Germany and Shoppers Drug Mart. The timing of the announcement is interesting, given the threat of a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. has had advertisers scrambling to develop contingency plans as to where to shift their marketing efforts if TikTok is no longer accessible. As Reuters recently reported, brands and agencies have been having meetings, but for some seeing strong performance from their TikTok ads, there’s no plan to pull out as of yet. The report also cited data from Insider Intelligence that claims TikTok’s U.S. ad revenue is expected to reach $6.83 billion this year, from $780 million in 2020. TikTok had announced just ahead of the hearing its platform now reaches 150 million monthly active users in the U.S."
392,Capital efficiency is the new VC filter for startups,[],"April 27, 2023","The VC landscape has undergone a tectonic shift in the past year. A year ago, 90% of VC meetings with startups would have been about growth with little regard for how that growth would be achieved. It didn’t matter whether you were burning money left and right: As long as you had chubby growth numbers, a strong story and charisma, your round was pretty much guaranteed. But as cash becomes more expensive, investors are giving more and more attention to resource-focused, shrewd founders who can handle the hard times ahead. In 2023, most VC meetings focus on whether a business can deliver sustainable, efficient growth during the downturn. As far as our anecdotal evidence is concerned, most founders haven’t quite adjusted to the change. We repeatedly see startups at all stages failing to raise at the same multiples and velocity they used to because, by current standards, they are terribly capital inefficient and may not even be aware of that. In this article, we will explain why that happens and which metrics to track to understand where you stand on the capital efficiency scale. We also explore potential solutions that have proven helpful to companies we worked with. But first, let’s talk about how you shouldn’t measure your capital efficiency. Understanding where you stand as a business boils down to the metrics you use and how well you can interpret them. In this respect, capital efficiency remains the blind spot for most founders, who rely on a single metric to draw conclusions. This figure can be found by dividing customer lifetime value by customer acquisition cost (LTV:CAC ratio). The biggest problem with treating LTV:CAC as the holy grail of capital efficiency boils down to its oversimplified and often straight-up misleading nature. In fact, the rate at which this metric gets misconstrued by SaaS companies has even started conversations about the need to retire the metric altogether. The biggest problem with treating LTV:CAC as the holy grail of capital efficiency boils down to its oversimplified and often straight-up misleading nature. For this method to be foolproof, you must use reliable retention data, which can be hard to come by for startups with little historical data. As an example, we worked with several startups who calculated their CAC wrong or based LTV calculations on unrealistic churn assumptions in absence of historical data. This, in turn, showed “fake good,” bogus LTV:CAC ratio numbers. Whether SaaS companies should ditch the LTV:CAC metric entirely is debatable, but the point still stands: You can’t measure your capital efficiency only that way. Today, investors zoom in on other efficiency metrics that paint a more reliable and comprehensive picture of the startup’s capital efficiency, and so should you. Let’s see what they are. CAC payback is one of the focal and most telling metrics you can turn to if you need to understand how efficiently you use your capital. It shows how long it will take for your customer acquisition costs to pay off. How long should your payback time be? Ideally — as short as possible, with specific ballparks depending on your industry and business model. According to Bessemer Venture Partners, here are the benchmarks for B2B SaaS that investors will measure your payback against: The importance of staying within these benchmarks is vital when you compete with companies in the same space. For example, while Asana takes almost five years to recoup its CAC, Monday achieves this 2.3 times faster, with a CAC payback of 25 months. Unfortunately, we see startups falling outside of these benchmarks all the time. One of the startups we worked with turned out to have a CAC payback of over 35 months. Just think about it: almost three years to break even on a single customer acquisition! How do you fix a situation like this? There are a few key steps that will bring your payback time down:"
393,PayPal adds Apple Pay support for small merchants using Advanced Checkout,['@indianidle'],"April 4, 2023","PayPal is adding new tools for small business owners, including Apple Pay support at checkout, the option for customers to save their cards for this specific site and access to IC++ pricing. Small and medium businesses currently have two ways to integrate PayPal in the checkout flow. In addition to the Standard Checkout integration that lets you accept PayPal payments with little effort, the company also has an Advanced Checkout integration feature for companies that want more personalizations and payment features. Companies that have opted for the latter option can now accept Apple Pay payments from their customers. The checkout tool already offers multiple options to customers — they can make payments via PayPal, Venmo and PayPal Pay Later, as well as with credit cards. Last year, PayPal and Venmo announced support for Apple’s tap-to-pay-on-iPhone solution. It marked the beginning of a new business relationship between Apple and the payment company. PayPal is also adding another tool to the checkout product. Customers can choose to save their cards in a secure vault for that particular e-commerce business — the card won’t be stored in a PayPal account as customers don’t need to have a PayPal account for card payments. So if users are shopping from that business frequently, they don’t need to punch in their card details every time. The payment company also has support for account updater and network token service, which automatically updates details when lost or stolen cards-on-file are reissued. Nitin Prabhu, the company’s VP for merchant experiences and payment solutions, told TechCrunch on a call that with Advanced Checkout, the company doesn’t share any purchase intelligence with other competitors. But he mentioned that the data they gather from a merchant site can be used to offer their products, including PayPal Pay Later. He also noted that PayPal uses the data to mitigate risk and fraud. The fintech is also introducing the IC++ pricing model for businesses. Until now, PayPal offered a flat fee model for advanced checkout. But Prabhu said that for medium-sized businesses making multiple millions a year, IC++ could offer a good alternative. The IC++ structure consists of interchange fees (charged by the issuer bank), card network fees (charged by a network like Visa and Mastercard) and markup fees collected by PayPal. With this method, merchants can see if they can incentivize customers into using cards by a specific bank or a specific network. PayPal is facing competition from Amazon, which in January launched the Buy with Prime product offering checkouts and shipping. In a recent note to clients, wealth management/research firm Bernstein said that companies are offering services beyond the checkout button, which has been PayPal’s core strength historically. “For other pay buttons, like PayPal, for years the pitch of pay buttons has been that they drive up sales conversions by double digits. Today, the pay button alone is increasingly becoming commoditized given that almost a dozen options now exist and guest checkout (the real friction point for consumers) is shrinking in its share of checkout. While Buy With Prime may not be a big deal on its own in the context of overall eCommerce (which is larger than eRetail), we worry about the risk of share losses from a thousand cuts for PayPal. As a reminder, the core button remains the profit engine for PayPal, and within that business, SMBs are PayPal’s bread and butter (with deeply attractive economics),” the note said. PayPal has also been trying to be a checkout option for different e-commerce purchases. Last year, it partnered with Amazon to offer customers Venmo as a payment option."
394,China’s central bank digital currency takes a bigger place on WeChat’s platform,['@ritacyliao'],"April 26, 2023","For the last few years, China’s central bank has been trying to ramp up the adoption of digital yuan, or e-CNY, which forms part of the country’s monetary base, M0. The bank has a designated app for e-CNY that crossed 261 million individual users in early 2022, but it’s also enlisting help from the private sector to take its official digital money to a broader user base. China’s biggest messenger WeChat said Wednesday that it’s extended the use of e-CNY payments to transactions happening through its short video and mini-app platforms, which together cover merchants from small influencers to brands touting products on WeChat. For those unfamiliar with WeChat, the Tencent-owned messenger is a sprawling empire that far exceeds what WhatsApp or Messenger can do. It comes with its own payments system, WeChat Pay; supports millions of third-party lite apps, making it a rival to the App Store; has a short video network that competes with Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese version, for eyeball time; and has a host of other features that can easily be standalone apps — but Asia loves super apps. In 2022, WeChat mini apps generated several trillion RMB ($1 = RMB6.9) of transaction value, according to Tencent. Clearly, that sea of microtransactions are potential targets of the digital yuan. Today’s update is an expansion of the e-CNY payments option that WeChat already supports since early last year. Only merchants that accept e-CNY will be taking payments in the central bank digital currency, according to WeChat’s announcement. Image Credits: WeChat Image Credits: WeChat While the central bank has set up a network of e-CNY payment gateways at online and offline retailers across China, WeChat Pay and its rival Alipay, Alibaba’s affiliated payments method are still by far the most ubiquitous digital payment methods. The central bank regulator made it clear that digital yuan isn’t meant to compete with the two payments giants. Rather, it’s supposed to play a complementary role. As we reported previously: For instance, it could support anonymity for small-value transactions just like physical cash. In other cases, large amounts of funds sent from a provincial government to a town could be paid in e-CNY to prevent corruption using the digital currency’s traceable capabilities. Digital yuan’s anonymity is relative and applies only to the transacting parties involved. As with all other forms of internet services in China, digital yuan users have to verify their real identities before using the wallet. To use e-CNY on WeChat, they need to link their real-name verified central bank wallet to WeChat Pay, which also authenticates their identities. Say a user sees a frying pan they like from a WeChat short video that happens to be selling it — like how TikTok is trying to integrate commerce. At checkout, they will be directed to WeChat Pay, which is linked to their bank accounts, and now, the digital yuan wallet as well.   "
395,Ford to spend $1.3B to transform Canada factory into EV manufacturing hub,['@kirstenkorosec'],"April 11, 2023","Ford said Tuesday it will spend $1.34 billion (C$1.8B) to turn its 70-year-old Oakville facility in Canada into an assembly plant for its next-generation of electric vehicles. The campus, which first opened in 1953, will be renamed Oakville Electric Vehicle Complex. The company said Tuesday it will begin modernizing the 487-acre site in the second quarter of 2024. The upgrade includes completely retooling the facility that currently produces the internal combustion engine-powered Ford Edge and Lincoln Nautilus to one that only produces EVs. This is the first time that Ford has completely retooled an existing plant for EVs in North America. Ford also plans to add a 407,000-square-foot battery plant that will use cells and arrays from its BlueOvalSK Battery Park in Kentucky. Workers will assemble the components into battery packs and then install them into EVs produced at the plant. “I’m most excited for the world to see the incredible next-generation electric and fully digitally connected vehicles produced in Oakville,” CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. Ford, along with its rivals, are scrambling to upgrade existing facilities and build new ones as they shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs. Ford has said it wants the production capacity to sell 2 million EVs a year globally by the end of 2026. Ford has also announced plans to modernize its assembly plant in Cologne, Germany and build a $5.6 billion complex in Tennessee known as “BlueOval” that will be the epicenter of its future electric vehicles. Ford announced in March that its BlueOval City complex outside of Memphis, Tennessee will include a truck plant capable of producing 500,000 electric vehicles a year. The first vehicle to come off the line will be a next-gen electric truck, code named Project T3, in 2025. Construction at BlueOval City began last fall. A $5.8 billion sister site in Kentucky, called BlueOvalSK Battery Park, will house a pair of battery plants. The company also announced in 2023 plans to invest $3.5 billion to build a factory in Michigan that will make cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries for its growing portfolio of electric vehicles. The factory will not make nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), a technology that is in its current EVs. Ford said it is working with Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., known as CATL. Under the arrangement, Ford’s wholly owned subsidiary would manufacture the battery cells using LFP battery cell knowledge and services provided by CATL."

397,I played the anime dating sim that does your taxes for you,['@asilbwrites'],"March 30, 2023","Yes, there is an anime dating sim that does your taxes, and it actually works. Tax Heaven 3000 is a game produced by MSCHF, the venture-funded creative studio behind projects like Push Party, the Lil Nas X blood shoes, the big red Astro Boy boots and Dead Startup Toys. Basically, they just make a bunch of absurd ideas into reality, which is perhaps the most noble possible use of VC money. In Tax Heaven 3000 (or TH3K, for those initiated), you have just moved to a new town, and you don’t know anyone. You need to buy a pencil to fill out some forms for your new lease, but — oh no! You’ve bumped into a pink-haired anime girl named Iris! You hit it off, despite the fact that she immediately asked you if you’re a U.S. resident, which your character describes as a “weirdly nationalist” first impression. You meet up for coffee later, where she asks you more about yourself, like whether you’re filing taxes single or jointly, your employment situation, your phone number and if you’ve invested in crypto (if that’s the case, she abruptly leaves and the game ends). Your romantic love story with Iris (get it, like IRS?) continues similarly throughout the game — while getting to know you, she asks you further questions, like what your address is and whether you have dependents (TH3K only works for single people without dependents, because Iris doesn’t want to get involved in a complicated situation and/or MSCHF did not make the game that complex… also, it doesn’t do state tax.) She even gets nosy enough to ask you for your annual income, tax withholdings and even your social security number, but you’re so enamored by Iris that you’re willing to look past her invasive questions — and the fact that she seems to love talking about taxes. A lot. Image Credits: MSCHF Image Credits: MSCHF By the end of the game — and after you’ve verified your information is correct, you’ve uploaded your tax forms, etc. — you get an actual PDF of your tax return, which you can just print out and mail to the IRS. Just make sure you remove the two top pages of the document before you put them into an envelope, because they’re littered with Lisa Frank-style graphics. But you don’t need those pages, they’re just informational! For you! Iris wants you to feel empowered to do your taxes without the evil corporate lobbyists like TurboTax! Is Tax Heaven 3000 safe? That’s up to your own discretion, because there’s no doubt that someone on the internet has been duped into giving a devious anime girl their social security number before (people do crazy things for VTubers). But for what it’s worth, this is a piece of software that you download onto your computer, which doesn’t connect to the internet. I was able to play through the whole game while disconnected from Wi-Fi. But, for the record, I did not give the cute anime girl my social security number, in part because I have already done my taxes (not to brag). Like any manic pixie dream girl, there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Iris. She has a dark streak — sometimes, she looks at you sternly, and the cute soundtrack completely stops. Image Credits: MSCHF Image Credits: MSCHF “Don’t ever get involved with TurboTax,” Iris will tell you, her cheeks reddening. “They’re dangerous.”  In the game, you notice it, and it feels a bit fishy, but you don’t think too hard about it. But of course, this is MSCHF, so there’s always more to the story. On TH3K’s website, there’s a button to download the X-rated patch of the game (the actual gameplay is pretty PG-13, though there are a few innuendos). This is not an actual X-rated patch (and I only clicked on it for journalistic purposes) — it’s a link to a Wattpad story about Iris’ abduction from TurboTax. Yes, MSCHF appears to have written fan fiction about Iris the tax prep anime girl (there is even some fan art). At least we got a little closure about why Iris is so tortured by corporate tax prep software.    "

399,Ex-Flipkart exec’s Flash app wants to be an inbox for your e-commerce needs,['@indianidle'],"March 23, 2023","Email inboxes are tricky tools, because they become hard to manage over time and you have to spend a lot of time searching for what you’re trying to find. And if you have been using one email address everywhere, it’s also painful to change that at a later stage. Email tools also often fail to identify different kinds of emails and group them properly. India-based startup Flash is attempting to solve this problem by creating a solution (read email ID) that you can use for all e-commerce needs, and it will even reward you to use the service. Flash, available on both iOS and Android, lets you create an email ID (with @flash.co domain) that you can use on all shopping platforms. In return, you can earn rewards such as coupons and cashback. Once you download the app from the Play Store or the App Store, you can sign up with a new email ID and use it to shop across platforms. After placing an order, you can also track multiple shipments from within the app. Image Credits: Flash Image Credits: Flash The inbox is divided into two parts: Handpicked and Others. The Handpicked inbox has important emails such as order delivery updates and sign-up verifications, while the Other section carries promotional emails. In my usage in the last few weeks, I noticed that some sign-up/verification emails ended up in the Other inbox. The startup said it is still ironing out its filtering algorithm to avoid that. Flash’s email inbox is rudimentary at the moment. You can only forward or reply to emails. Flash said that next month, users will have features like archive, auto-forward and flags. Image Credits: Flash Image Credits: Flash Apart from creating a new inbox for e-commerce, the app also lets you connect it to your Gmail inbox. This allows the app to build a summary of your orders in the last 12 months and show a report of your e-commerce expenses. Plus, it also fetches orders for shipment tracking from your Gmail account. Almost all e-commerce and payment services in India have offered some kind of reward to boost engagement and retention. Flash has a couple of types of rewards up its sleeve: First, it provides cashback on its own for completing certain orders or signing up for some services with a “@flash.co” email address. It also has special coupons through brand collaborations with Walmart-owned Myntra, Puma, pharmacy platform Pharmeasy, and Warburg Pincus-backed electronics brand Boat. Discount coupons are standard practice in the Indian e-commerce market. Google Pay, Paytm, and Tiger Global-backed Cred offer a ton of these coupons in different shapes and forms. But often, they have a lot of caveats attached. Image Credits: Flash Image Credits: Flash Flash also provides rewards for certain “streaks,” like shopping several times with a certain brand or placing orders across a particular category in a defined time period. This will let users earn a mix of rewards from Flash and brands both. The startup provides Flash coins, which are equivalent to the local currency as rewards. Users can deposit the money directly into their bank accounts by linking their UPI (Unified Payment Infercae) IDs, India’s indigenous payment network. Flash was founded by Ranjith Boyanapalli, a former Flipkart executive, in April last year. The company raised $5.8 million in seed funding in November from a bunch of investors, including Global Founders Capital (GFC), White Venture Capital and Zinal Growth, with participation from the likes of Flipkart founder Binny Bansal, Cred’s Kunal Shah, Udaan’s Sujeet Kumar, and Groww’s Lalit Keshre. Before starting Flash, Boyanapalli was a senior VP at Flipkart, where he managed the company’s fintech and payment verticals. In a call with TechCrunch, he said there’s huge value in leveraging the data of online shoppers to provide value to consumers. Flash’s idea is rooted in taking advantage of cross-merchant data intelligence through a single email ID, he said. “We are targeting around 25 million power shoppers in India who shop from multiple merchants every year and have a major contribution in terms of market spend in the country’s e-commerce market,” Boyanapalli said. One of the challenges these shoppers face is excessive spam from different merchants, he said. Plus, it’s hard to track orders through emails. Notably, Gmail has rolled out order tracking capabilities, but it’s limited to certain geographies for now. For brands, it’s harder to engage customers, as they are bombarded with coupons, which results in lower conversion rates. Boyanapalli said Flash is trying to solve all these problems through one app. There are plenty of e-commerce apps in both India and the U.S. that offer either order tracking or rewards, including Shopify’s Shop app, Groupon, and Cashkaro. But Flash believes that it has an advantage because it brings all of these functions together in one app. India’s e-commerce market is set to double in size to over $130 billion by 2025, according to Bernstein, and the startup is trying to target people who will contribute most to those figures. But the vast majority of those people make purchases through Amazon India and Flipkart, services that currently are not playing ball with Flash for any rewards program. Flash is focused on rolling out features such as monthly reports, inbox search, email labeling, archiving and auto-forwarding in the next few months. The company is also building its own “Login with Flash” authentication mechanism that e-commerce partners can integrate into their service. Apart from feature rollouts, the startup is also thinking about category expansion by tuning its product for travel and OTT (over the air) purchases. So in the future, the app could let you manage all your tickets and subscriptions. Flash is gearing up to launch in the U.S. this year, where the e-commerce market is much bigger than that of India, both in terms of high-value shoppers and gross revenue."
400,"In letter to EU, open source bodies say Cyber Resilience Act could have ‘chilling effect’ on software development",['@psawers'],"April 18, 2023","More than a dozen open source industry bodies have published an open letter asking the European Commission (EC) to reconsider aspects of its proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), saying it will have a “chilling effect” on open source software development if implemented in its current form. Thirteen organizations, including the Eclipse Foundation, Linux Foundation Europe, and the Open Source Initiative (OSI), also note that the Cyber Resilience Act as its written “poses an unnecessary economic and technological risk to the EU.” The purpose of the letter, it seems, is for the open source community to garner a bigger say in the evolution of the CRA as it progresses through the European Parliament. The letter reads: We write to express our concern that the greater open source community has been underrepresented during the development of the Cyber Resilience Act to date, and wish to ensure this is remedied throughout the co-legislative process by lending our support. Open source software represents more than 70% of the software present in products with digital elements in Europe. Yet, our community does not have the benefit of an established relationship with the co-legislators. The software and other technical artefacts produced by us are unprecedented in their contribution to the technology industry along with our digital sovereignty and associated economic benefits on many levels. With the CRA, more than 70% of the software in Europe is about to be regulated without an in-depth consultation. First unveiled in draft from back in September, the Cyber Resilience Act strives to codify into law best cybersecurity practices for connected products sold in the European Union. The legislation is designed to strong-arm internet-connected hardware and software makers, for example those who manufacture internet-enabled toys or “smart” refrigerators, into ensuring their products are robust and kept up-to-date with the latest security updates. Penalties for non-compliance may include fines of up to €15 million, or 2.5% of global turnover. While the Cyber Resilience Act is still in its early stages, with nothing set to pass into actual law in the immediate future, the legislation has already set some alarm bells ringing in the open source world. It’s estimated that open source components constitute between 70-90% of most modern software products, from web browsers to servers, yet many open source projects are developed by individuals or small teams in their spare time. Thus, the CRA’s intentions of extending the CE marking self-certification system to software, whereby all software developers will have to testify that their software is ship-shape, could stifle open source development for fear of contravening the new legislation. The draft legislation as it stands does in fact go some way toward addressing some of these concerns. It says (emphasis ours): In order not to hamper innovation or research, free and open-source software developed or supplied outside the course of a commercial activity should not be covered by this Regulation. This is in particular the case for software, including its source code and modified versions, that is openly shared and freely accessible, usable, modifiable and redistributable. In the context of software, a commercial activity might be characterized not only by charging a price for a product, but also by charging a price for technical support services, by providing a software platform through which the manufacturer monetises other services, or by the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software. However, the language as it stands has prompted concerns from the open source world. While the text does seem to exempt non-commercial open source software from its scope, trying to define what is meant by “non-commercial” is not a straight forward endeavor. As GitHub policy director Mike Linksvayer noted in a blog post last month, developers often “create and maintain open source in a variety of paid and unpaid contexts,” which may include corporate, government, non-profit, academic, and more. “Non-profit organizations offer paid consulting services as technical support for their open source software,” Linksvayer wrote. “And increasingly, developers receive sponsorships, grants, and other forms of financial support for their efforts. These nuances require a different exemption for open source.” So really, it all comes down to language — clarifying that open source software developers won’t be held responsible for any security slipups of a downstream product that uses a particular component. “The Cyber Resilience Act can be improved by focusing on finished products,” Linksvayer added. “If open source software is not offered as a paid or monetized product, it should be exempt.” A growing number of proposed regulations in Europe is raising concerns across the technological landscape, with open source software a recurring theme. Indeed, the issues around the CRA are somewhat reminiscent of those facing the EU’s upcoming AI Act, which seeks to govern AI applications based on their perceived risks. GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke recently opined that open source software developers should be exempt from the scope of that legislation when it comes into effect, as it could create burdensome legal liability for general purpose AI systems (GPAI) and give greater power to well-financed big tech companies. As for the Cyber Resilience Act, the message from the open source software community is pretty clear — they feel that their voices are not being heard, and if changes are not made to the proposed legislation then it could have a major long-tail impact. “Our voices and expertise should be heard and have an opportunity to inform public authorities’ decisions,” the letter reads. “If the CRA is, in fact, implemented as written, it will have a chilling effect on open source software development as a global endeavour, with the net effect of undermining the EU’s own expressed goals for innovation, digital sovereignty, and future prosperity.” The full list of signatories includes: The Eclipse Foundation; Linux Foundation Europe; Open Source Initiative (OSI); OpenForum Europe (OFE); Associaçāo de Empresas de Software Open Source Portuguesas (ESOP); CNLL; The Document Foundation (TDF); European Open Source Software Business Associations (APELL); COSS – Finnish Centre for Open Systems and Solutions; Open Source Business Alliance (OSBA); Open Systems and Solutions (COSS); OW2, and Software Heritage Foundation."
401,Down rounds are prevailing as power shifts to VCs again,['@alex'],"May 3, 2023","It appears things are not going well for startups these days. Down rounds, or a funding round in which a startup raises capital at a lower valuation than its last investment, have become more common than the venture community has seen in nearly half a decade. According to data from Carta, down rounds nearly quadrupled in number in Q1 2023 compared to a year earlier. Down rounds are bad because they can lead to outsized dilution, unhappy investors, employees fretting over the value of their equity and other less than winsome events. They are new to many startups and were quite rare during the most recent venture boom, when so many startups were raising multiple up rounds in the same year that it became a mini-trend. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. It’s not shocking to see down rounds becoming more common, but it is somewhat surprising that they accounted for nearly one-fifth of all venture investments Carta saw in the first quarter. Things have gotten worse for startups much sooner than we anticipated. Furthermore, Carta reports that a minimum of “40% of all investments in Series A and Series B companies were bridge rounds in Q1, the highest figures of the 2020s.” The same forces driving the prevalence of down rounds are at play here: Namely, the pace and value of venture capital deal-making are in retreat, and as the public markets have reset, so have valuations for startups at all stages. When we went over Carta’s initial take of its Q1 2023 data, we found that fewer dollars were going to work at lower prices. That might sound like an odd combination of events. After all, if startups are cheaper, why aren’t venture investors putting more capital to work? It’s because venture investment is essentially a momentum trade, in which rising prices for startup shares lead to investors being able to raise more capital, which allows them to put more money to work at even higher prices. Yes, it is something of a self-reinforcing cycle. During periods of exuberance, if you press a VC about why they are moving so quickly and skipping nominally important techniques of intelligent investing like due diligence, they will say something about needing to play the game on the field."
402,"Max Q: Expect the worst, hope for the best",['@breadfrom'],"May 1, 2023","Hello and welcome back to Max Q! In this issue: Japanese company ispace lost communication with its Hakuto-R lander just moments before it was supposed to touch down on the lunar surface, a major blow for what the company hoped would be the first fully private lander to reach the moon. “At this moment, we have not been able to confirm successful landing on the lunar surface,” ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada said on the company’s livestream. “Currently, we have not confirmed the communication from the lander. […] We have to assume that we could not complete the landing on the lunar surface.” He said that ispace engineers will continue to assess the situation and provide an update once that investigation is complete. In an interview with TechCrunch, Hakamada said that while it is possible that the lander is safe and intact on the surface, there is no data to support that yet and it’s unclear whether imagery from a lunar orbiter could shed light on the situation either. Image Credits: ispace Hakuto-R landing livestream (screenshot) Image Credits: ispace Hakuto-R landing livestream (screenshot) Rocket engine maker Ursa Major had some big wins: First, it publicly announced news that Astra’s new Rocket 4 launch vehicle will use Ursa Major’s Hadley liquid engine to power its upper stage. Then, I uncovered that the company quietly closed a massive new tranche of funding last October at a $400 million pre-money valuation.
Ursa, led by CEO Joe Laurienti, is building a 5,000-pound liquid oxygen and kerosene engine called Hadley and a much larger, 10x more powerful Ripley engine with a 50,000-pound thrust. The company eschews the vertical integration paradigm that has historically dominated the aerospace industry. Instead, it focuses solely on the engine, one of the trickiest parts of a rocket to develop. “We really like the notion that we are a technology development company, and the companies that are flying rockets today should not be flying the same engine that they architected for their rocket 10 years ago,” Laurienti told TechCrunch in an interview last year. “That’s the paradigm we see in vertical integration.” Ursa’s other public customers include small launch companies Phantom Space and Stratolaunch. The company has also scored an engine delivery contract with the U.S. Air Force. Jordan Forness, Vehicle Operations manager at Ursa Major, reviews a Hadley engine before it ships to Astra.

403,The story of how Dave took the long road to become a neobank,['@bayareawriter'],"March 26, 2023","Welcome to The Interchange! If you received this in your inbox, thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you’re reading this as a post on our site, sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week, I’ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s my job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know. — Mary Ann Right before the Silicon Valley Bank meltdown, I had a conversation with Jason Wilk, founder and CEO of neobank Dave, about that company’s business. I was intrigued because the neobank — which counted Mark Cuban as one of its investors as a private company — took what some might say was a backward route to becoming a neobank. Rather than start out offering checking and savings, it worked its way there. And the strategy seems to have paid off for the fintech company, which went public in January of 2022. It recently reported 45% higher GAAP revenue of $59.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 45% from the same period the year prior. Here are excerpts of my interview with Wilk, which have been edited for brevity and clarity. TC: Are you benefiting from higher interest rates, and if so, how? JW: This is a challenging place for growth companies, who may have access to more capital to eventually get it because the cost of capital is a lot more expensive due to the interest rates. That’s one of the reasons why our stock has come down so much — given we are not yet profitable, although close to it. The benefit of higher interest rates for customers is that they can earn higher interest on savings and deposits, and we do benefit from that as well, as we can earn extra income from the higher rates. But I’d say overall that the highest interest rate environment is more negative than positive on the business. You’ve mentioned a path to profitability. When do you see that happening?  Last year we were 8 to 10 quarters out. Now we’re 4 to 6 quarters away from when we expect the company to be profitable. We were before in 2018 and 2019, so we’ve been there before. We’ve added a sufficient amount of staff to build our future roadmap and have 1.9 million monthly transacting members on to Dave. We need to get 2.2 million to 2.4 million customers to get to profitability/break even. We don’t need to raise capital or any other liquidity. Our anchor feature that disrupted overdraft fees is our Extra Cash product, which lets people borrow small amounts of money and now get up to a $500 cash advance [that limit was increased from $250 to $500 last summer) with up to 14 days to pay it back, with no late fees and no interest. Then in 2020 during the pandemic, the government was giving away a lot of free money via stimulus dollars and so there was less of a need for it and our marketing message was less resonant during that time. So that’s why in 2021, we grew the business about 26%, and we’ve really ramped things back up as things are returning closer to normal. You launched banking services not that long ago. How is that going? Dave was focused on Extra Cash Product but then our most requested feature is that people wanted to bank with Dave. So at the end of 2021 we launched our own checking account, and as of the second and third quarter of 2022, that was going so well we decided to just become a full-on neobank and give a checking account to every customer, and now every new and existing member is a banking member. And because of that broader expansion, and now that every customer has a card, we were able to grow the banking business 90% year over year. So you did not start out as a full-blown neobank — you sort of evolved into one. That must have helped lower your CAC (customer acquisition costs). Yes, that’s right. It was always the plan if you go back to our seed deck. We realized that CAC to acquire banking customers is very high. And now it’s a very big strategic focus of the company. We think it gives us the ability to stay with our customers a lot longer and become their primary banking destination. Our strategy moving forward is, “Hey you can still get Extra Cash and send the money to your Chase account, but now we have this Dave debit card, which you can access the money even faster and also you can put your paycheck in here and stop paying things like minimum balance fees and customer support fees and all the other things that banks are trying to charge for it this point.” We saw our cost of acquisition going down actually — 31% year over year in 2022 over 2021. We acquired about 550,000 new members in the fourth quarter alone. How else do you continuously make yourself relevant to customers so they don’t outgrow your services?  One way is to let the customer decide on a payback date that’s fair to them and that aligns with their next paycheck date. It’s a guaranteed amount of money that you can tap into paycheck to paycheck, and it does not require any kind of mandatory fee. So instead of paying your bank $38, you can choose to tip Dave, anywhere from zero to 10% of the amount we give you. On average our tip is around $4. And it’s less risky for Dave, because we’re advancing money, not loaning it. I started Dave because I was frustrated by all the overdraft fees being charged by the big banks. I felt it was unfair to charge reliable customers such a large fee against a negative balance knowing they will be brought back whole in a couple of days. How does AI come into play with all of this? We’ve gotten really good with our AI engine, which is able to very accurately detect somebody’s income and understand how risky it might be to give somebody the money before they get paid. And because of that AI engine, we’ve gotten default rates down to about 2%. And we’ve been able to increase the amount of money we give away so it’s just gotten a lot better over the years. We also use AI with customer support, over 50% of our support responses are with a chatbot. That also brings down costs. We have 320 employees and most banks have over 100,000 employees. Higher headcount often leads to higher prices for consumers. Now, Dave is not the only neobank reporting impressive numbers. Grasshopper Bank, a digital bank for businesses, earlier this month reported that its assets reached over $620 million, up 108% year over year and that its total revenues exceeded $17 million in 2022, representing 39% growth year over year. Reports Romain Dillet: “Fintech startup Checkout.com is better known for its payment processing service, but the company is launching a new product…: its customers can now create payment cards for their own customers. The company has been testing Checkout.com Issuing for a while, and millions of cards have already been created with the new service. Checkout.com supports physical cards as well as virtual cards that can be used multiple times or can be set to be disabled after the first payment.” More here. Reports Sarah Perez: “Amazon may be closing a number of its high-tech physical retail stores in recent days, but some of the technology it developed for those stores is finding a new home. The online retailer said that Panera will now become the first restaurant to deploy Amazon’s palm reading payment and loyalty system, known as Amazon One, in its own stores, allowing its customers to both pay as well as access the chain’s loyalty program.” More here. Also from Sarah: “Restaurant delivery service DoorDash announced it will begin to support the ability for customers to pay with cash for their online orders. But there’s a catch — the feature is only being rolled out to DoorDash’s white-label delivery solution for restaurants, DoorDash Drive, which allows restaurant owners to offer delivery from their own website or app while tapping into DoorDash’s courier network. The company says that, during tests, Chinese restaurants and pizza shops have been early adopters of the feature.” More here. Reports Christine Hall: “Payments and shopping service Klarna is the latest company to announce its integration with ChatGPT. The company said it is “one of the first brands to work with OpenAI to use its protocol to build an integrated Plugin for ChatGPT” and is rolling out a personalized shopping experience that provides product recommendations when Klarna users ask for shopping advice, inspiration and product links via Klarna’s search and compare tool.” More here. From me: Roofstock on March 22 laid off about 27% of its staff, just five months after the property technology startup laid off 20% of its workforce. The online marketplace for investing in leased single-family rental homes one year ago raised $240 million at a $1.9 billion valuation. According to the email, co-founder and CEO Gary Beasley said the reduction in force (RIF) was “in response to the challenging macro environment” and the “negative impact” it is having on Roofstock’s business. More here. The company’s website states that it has 400+ employees, or “Roofsters,” as they’re dubbed, but it is not known if that figure is current. Hindenburg Research issued a report that tore into payments company Block (formally known as Square) after a two-year investigation, alleging that the company “facilitated fraudsters,” reported Bloomberg. Among the allegations, Bloomberg reported, the report charged that “Block’s wildly popular Cash App was likely facilitating scammers taking advantage of government-stimulus programs during the pandemic.” Issuance of the report’s findings led to Block saying it would explore legal action against Hindenburg. The allegations hit the company’s stock price, which slid by 15% on March 23, the day the report was released. F-Prime Capital published a State of Fintech Report earlier this year (which we covered in-depth here). But one area we didn’t dive into was the LatAm fintech findings. F-Prime points out that there are five Latin American companies in the F-Prime Fintech Index: Nubank, PagSeguro, Mercado Libre, Stone and dLocal. Nubank and dLocal were among the 10 largest exits during 2020 and 2021, and both saw significant declines in their stocks. But, F-Prime pointed out via email, that “scaled LatAm fintech companies are still growing at high rates,” with Nubank growing LTM (last 12 months) revenue by 117% and Mercado Libre growing by 54%. Also, interestingly, it found that four out of the five Latin American companies in the Fintech Index have a payment business model. Insider published a couple of articles about HR/fintech startup Deel this past week, taking a look at the company’s culture, its practice of hiring so many independent contractors (event its CEO is one!) and the question of whether employees were misclassified as independent contractors. You can read those articles here and here.

404,Google consolidates AI research divisions into Google DeepMind,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 20, 2023","As Google looks to maintain pace in AI with the rest of the tech giants, it’s consolidating its AI research divisions. Today Google announced Google DeepMind, a new unit made up of the DeepMind team and the Google Brain team from Google Research. In a blog post, DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis said that Google DeepMind will work “in close collaboration . . . across the Google product areas” to “deliver AI research and products.” As a part of Google DeepMind’s formation, Google says that it’ll create a new scientific board to oversee research progress and the direction of the unit, which will be led by Koray Kavukcuoglu, VP of research at DeepMind. Eli Collins, VP of product at Google Research, will join Google DeepMind as VP of product, while Google Brain lead Zoubin Ghahramani will become a member of the Google DeepMind research leadership team, reporting to Kavukcuoglu. Meanwhile, Jeff Dean, one of the co-founders of Google Brain, will take on the elevated role of chief scientist for both Google Research and Google DeepMind, reporting to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Google Research will remain an independent division reporting to Google SVP of technology and society James Manyika and will focus on “fundamental advances in computer science across areas such as algorithms and theory, privacy and security, quantum computing, health, climate and sustainability and responsible AI.” “Through Google DeepMind, we are bringing together our world-class talent in AI with the computing power, infrastructure and resources to create the next generation of AI breakthroughs and products across Google and Alphabet, and to do this in a bold and responsible way,” Hassabis wrote. “The work we are going to be doing now as part of this new combined unit will create the next wave of world-changing breakthroughs.” The phenomenal teams from Google Research’s Brain and @DeepMind have made many of the seminal research advances that underpin modern AI, from Deep RL to Transformers. Now we’re joining forces as a single unit, Google DeepMind, which I’m thrilled to lead! https://t.co/n2cpn91AOl — Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) April 20, 2023  Hassabis co-founded DeepMind in 2010 with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, and Google acquired the company for $500 million in 2014. The lab would go on to make headlines numerous times in the years following, developing AI that can beat human professional Go players and predict the structures of complex proteins. Google Brain was formed a year after DeepMind, in 2011, as a part-time research collaboration between Dean, Google researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng. It similarly accomplished much, creating tools such as TensorFlow, an AI model creation framework, as well as enhancements to Google Translate. Since the acquisition, DeepMind and Google Brain have worked harmoniously together for the most part — at least from the outside looking in. But there’s occasionally been strife between DeepMind and its corporate parent, Alphabet (which also owns Google). Senior managers at DeepMind reportedly tried to negotiate for years with Google for more autonomy, seeking an independent legal structure for the sensitive research they do. The talks were called off in May 2021. DeepMind has also struggled to break even with its growing expenses, which include the compute necessary to train massive AI models and a large headcount (around 1,000 employees). Alphabet was forced to write off nearly £1.1 billion ($1.5 billion) of DeepMind’s debt in 2019. DeepMind is now profitable, reporting a modest £44 million ($60 million) profit in 2020, up from a £477 million ($650 million) loss in 2019. But its revenue is almost entirely dependent on licensing its technologies to other Alphabet groups, like Waymo. We’re proud to announce that DeepMind and the Brain team from @Google Research will become a new unit: 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗱. Together, we'll accelerate progress towards a world where AI can help solve the biggest challenges facing humanity. → https://t.co/2pkooMzUvD — DeepMind (@DeepMind) April 20, 2023  Recently, DeepMind has taken on new importance within Alphabet as the company looks to beat back rivals like Microsoft and OpenAI in the race for revenue-generating AI. The Information reported last month that software engineers at Google Brain group are working with employees at DeepMind to develop software to compete with OpenAI, known as Gemini. Google’s recent AI product pushes, like the chatbot Bard, have been poorly received, causing Alphabet’s shares to drop precipitously. Google — threatened by Microsoft’s close collaboration with OpenAI on Bing Chat, an AI-powered chatbot integrated with the former’s Bing search engine — is also reportedly investing outsize resources into Magi, a collection of new search features with AI capabilities. Magi has a dedicated task force of over 160 people, newly formed as of this year. “We’ve been an AI-first company since 2016, because we see AI as the most significant way to deliver on our mission,” Pichai wrote in a blog post published this afternoon. “The pace of progress is now faster than ever before. To ensure the bold and responsible development of general AI, we’re creating Google DeepMind to help us build more capable systems more safely and responsibly.”"
405,AirTree backs generative AI content creation and management platform Narrato,['@catherineshu'],"April 3, 2023","Generative AI is hot among venture capital firms now, with $4.5 billion invested in 2022. Narrato, a AI content creation and collaboration platform, announced today it has joined the ranks of other generative AI startups with VC funding. Based in San Francisco, Narrato raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by AirTree Ventures, the Australian firm that was an early investor in Canva, Linktree and Employment Hero. Other participants in the round included OfBusiness, a B2B e-commerce platform, and serial entrepreneur Shreesha Ramdas. Narrato is used by customers including payments SaaS startup ChargeBee, language learning app Preply and customer onboarding software Rocketlane. It will work with AirTree to expand across the United States. Founded in January 2022 by Sophia Solanki, an Australian serial entrepreneur whose previous startup was content marketing and social media management SaaS platform DrumUp. Narrato founder Sophia Solanki. Image Credits: Narrato Narrato founder Sophia Solanki. Image Credits: Narrato Solanki told TechCrunch that the Narrato team’s first idea was to build the “GitHub for content,” with a workspace for marketing teams that offers automation, collaboration and publishing, among other features. But they had also been tracking generative AI over the past couple of years and “with its current state of maturity, it’s an extremely powerful tool for content creation.” The Narrato team decided to embed generative AI into different stages of the content process. Narrato’s main feature is an AI content assistant that helps with planning, including automatic brief generation, content creation and optimization. It also has collaboration and workflow tools and automated publishing features. Solanki explained that for both AI and non-AI content creation, users choose from templates, including blogs, articles, web copy, emails, video scripts, social media content and art. Narrato also has a chat-like format for content creation through AI, and plans to expand its selection of generative AI-assisted content templates to hundreds. Once briefs are created through generative AI, writers can use them for SEO guides and outlines. They also include research and benchmarking to help content creators reach a wider audience. Solanki named several startups as Narrato’s indirect and direct competitors. Notion, Clickup and Airtable are used by content creators for content project management, while Jasper and Copy.ai are content creation platforms that also use AI. How Narrato wants to differentiate is by embedding generative AI into the entire marketing and content creation workflow in a single platform. In a statement about the funding, AirTree partner Elicia McDonald said, “Having identified the massive opportunity for generative AI in content marketing and already successfully built two companies in this space, Sophia knows the market inside out. She has a strong connection to the problem and has achieved impressive traction for a company at such an early stage, especially considering they’ve bootstrapped to date.”  "

407,Nova is building guardrails for generative AI content to protect brand integrity,['@ron_miller'],"May 3, 2023","As brands incorporate generative AI into their creative workflows to generate new content associated with the company, they need to tread carefully to be sure that the new material adheres to the company’s style and brand guidelines. Nova is an early-stage startup building a suite of generative AI tools designed to protect brand integrity, and today, the company is announcing two new products to help brands police AI-generated content: BrandGuard and BrandGPT. With BrandGuard, you ingest your company’s brand guidelines and style guide, and with a series of models Nova has created, it can check the content against those rules to make sure it’s in compliance, while BrandGPT lets you ask questions about the brand’s content rules in ChatGPT style. Rob May, founder and CEO at the company, who previously founded Backupify, a cloud backup startup that was acquired by Datto back in 2014, recognized that companies wanted to start taking advantage of generative AI technology to create content faster, but they still worried about maintaining brand integrity, so he came up with the idea of building a guard rail system to protect the brand from generative AI mishaps. “We heard from multiple CMOs who were worried about ‘how do I know this AI-generated content is on brand?’ So we built this architecture that we’re launching called BrandGuard, which is a really interesting series of models, along with BrandGPT, which acts as an interface on top of the models,” May told TechCrunch. BrandGuard is like the back end for this brand protection system. Nova built five models that look for things that might seem out of whack. They run checks for brand safety, quality checking, whether it’s on brand, whether it adheres to style and whether it’s on campaign. Then it assigns each piece with a content score, and each company can decide what the threshold is for calling in a human to check the content before publishing. “When you have generative AI creating stuff, you can now score it on a continuum. And then you can set thresholds, and if something’s below, say 85% on brand, you can have the system flag it so that a human can take a look at it,” he said. Companies can decide whatever threshold they’re comfortable with. BrandGPT is designed for working with third parties like an agency or a contractor, who can ask questions about the company’s brand guidelines to make sure they are complying with them, May said. “We’re launching BrandGPT, which is meant to be the interface to all this brand-related security stuff that we’re doing, and as people interact with brands, they can access the style guides and better understand the brand, whether they’re a part of the company or not. These two products are available in public beta starting today. The company launched last year and has raised $2.4 million from Bee Partners, Fyrfly Ventures and Argon Ventures."
408,Mixpanel moves into marketing data with its latest product,['@ron_miller'],"May 2, 2023","Traditionally, Mixpanel has provided information about product usage to product teams. Increasingly, especially with the end of cookies and third-party data, product data has taken on greater value for other parts of the company, and Mixpanel is making it easier for marketing people to get at it too with a new product called Mixpanel Marketing Analytics. CEO Amir Movafaghi says that companies have typically used traffic analytics tools to determine who was using their product or website, but he says those tools lacked crucial conversion information about who turned into a customer — and that’s where Mixpanel feels it can differentiate itself from competitor tools. “The piece that we’re now really unlocking is that specific acquisition [data] and the traffic by being able to actually get and understand campaign performance in Mixpanel. So the marketing team doesn’t have to be on Adobe or Google at all. They can just use Mixpanel for their needs,” Movafaghi told TechCrunch. At least, that’s what he’s hoping.   He says that the abolition of cookies and the move to first party-data plays into what his company has always done, but that data suddenly has even greater value for the marketing team now too. “On one hand, one forcing function was the end of the third-party cookie, as well as data privacy as a general focus for all regulatory bodies in the EU, in the U.S. and just more broadly becoming top of mind. And that really was a major catalyst for marketing teams and organizations to realize that there’s this treasure trove of data in their first-party data,” he said. Marketing teams can now take advantage of the data in Mixpanel to better understand and target customers with the goal of improving the customer experience. He says that has involved creating job-specific templates in the interface, while simplifying querying to make it easier for each role — product or marketing — to get at and make use of the data in a way that makes sense to them. It could have the added benefit of helping sales, marketing and product teams better understand one another and coordinate in a way that makes sense by using the same tool. “The whole element of letting marketing and product teams come together and collaborate tightly is their ability to actually get from point A to point B completely in Mixpanel from acquisition to conversion to retention — that full life cycle management — and seeing their impact on things that the company cares about,” he said. That would presumably involve increasing sales and revenue. What’s more, he says the new product has been designed to work tightly with marketing automation tools. “Mixpanel is a conduit where you can basically directly connect all of these cohorts that you built in Mixpanel into your marketing automation tool,” he said. That means you can use this information to drive email targeting, ad targeting and so forth. This new product gives the company a new point of entry into customers when it comes to selling and marketing Mixpanel, and potentially the opportunity to sell the product more widely than it had been when it was confined to the product team. Mixpanel Marketing Analytics is available starting today at no extra charge for Mixpanel subscribers.  "
409,YC’s latest batch sure was a lot of ‘maybe AI can do… this?’,['@techcrunch'],"April 8, 2023","Sitting through hundreds of startups on YC Demo Days, you’re not always sure whether you are actually perceiving patterns or if your brain, as coffee battles with monotony, is inventing them in a kind of pareidolia for business plans. This year, though, the theme was pretty obvious: “AI can do that, probably! Maybe.” Certainly today’s AI models are more capable than yesterday’s, and yesteryear’s. But we’ve seen over and over how these systems demo well but fall down under systematic requirements or as tools with reliable and repeatable results. It’s hard not to see this batch as the  precursors of a coming wave of AI-powered shovelware. Pick a use case, do a little fine tuning of an available model (no one actually builds their own), cherry pick some good examples for screenshots and bolt on a prefab UI. Congratulations, you’re now the very first AI social media content generation platform for independent bars and restaurants in the Middle East and North Africa. Buy a couple hundred five-star reviews and you’re on your way! Now, it’s not that restaurants in Cairo and Beirut couldn’t use a helpful tool to gain some traction online and attract new customers. It’s that having AI, as it currently exists, do something for you is kind of like admitting that it doesn’t matter. Creating an AI-powered conversation agent that answers the phone at your business sounds good when you frame it as a way to never lose a customer. But what does the customer think when the business they call decides AI is the reception they deserve? Personally, I would hang up and try someone else. What about a trade worker who gets an AI calling to make an appointment? Same thing.   Realizing an email to you has been trivially “personalized” by AI is like being told, we can’t be bothered to personalize our emails, but we want you to think we do. Wouldn’t you feel tricked? It’s a systematic imposture upon the customers. If your first interview with a company is with a conversation agent or a person obviously reading generated cues from the knowledge base or whatever, do you feel like a person joining a team or a part being sized up for installation? You’re not even worth the full attention of a qualified human. That’s not necessarily the vibe I got from every AI startup in this YC batch, but I sure got it from a few of them. Here’s a partial (!) list of the “AI can do that, probably” companies I jotted down. Until about 30 seconds ago, I actually had appended thoughts about the companies to these brief and likely insufficient descriptions. But I realized the list was in danger of becoming a litany of complaints (not to mention way too long). No one likes to read someone just shooting down ideas left and right, especially when many of those ideas are being worked hard on by people for whom they are important. It’s easy to criticize. So easy someone in the summer batch may try to automate it! But I challenge you to look at that list and not wonder about some of the entries: Is that really what’s needed? Won’t that need lots of oversight? Doesn’t this introduce liability, or decrease transparency? Did anyone ask customers if they want this? Who verifies and audits the results — another AI? Who is displaced by these tools? Who trains people on them? Practically every company that presented said they’d gone live a few weeks earlier and miraculously were already at some healthy ARR. But a few weeks is hardly enough time for a major automation tool to be even installed and the documentation read, let alone evaluate its performance and whether it’s worth the price tag. I can’t imagine even half of these have been used, really used, by a potential customer. One example I can’t help but share: A generative marketing imagery company in its slide had the following prompt for the system to work with: Our classic ketchup is made only from sweet, juicy, red ripe tomatoes for the signature thick and rich taste of America’s Favorite Ketchup. The AI’s copy: SWEET & JUICY KETCHUP FOR ALL! If I was a marketer at Heinz and that was in the demo I was given, I would stand up, thank them for their time and open the door.   Some of the companies admitted they’d pivoted halfway through the program and wrote their first line of code for this new application just recently. Of course we must allow for the adventurous and freewheeling nature of early-stage startups, that’s part of the fun and excitement of the space. But do these companies really feel “innovative” to you? They seem rather to be big fans of innovation, sneaking into its room and trying on its clothes. (“Cute… here, you try it on, fintech.”) I know I’m underestimating the amount of work it takes even to build the most perfunctory AI-powered B2B SaaS service, but a lot of these feel like our old hackathons where someone would make an API available and everyone would try to shoehorn it in to the most realistic-sounding application, hoping to get that $1,000 gift card from SAP or whatever. There’s joy in the process of creation, but the results don’t really stand on their own. Probably I’ll be proven wrong when one of these companies goes unicorn and everyone laughs at the TechCrunch writer who doubted them. But I can’t shake the worry I felt in hearing founder after founder say with such conviction that their AI could do something better, when I suspect that conviction has been cultivated upon false pretenses."

411,All new Apple batteries will use 100% recycled cobalt by 2025,['@bheater'],"April 13, 2023","There’s a long list of things corporations can do to lessen consumer electronics’ environmental impact. Making systems easier to repair is up there, along with encouraging device recycling and updating manufacturing and supply chain processes. Utilizing recycled material in the devices themselves is a big piece of this puzzle, as well — it’s good publicity and better for the environment. A win-win. Companies like Google and Samsung have leaned into those efforts — the latter providing a great visual in the form of recycled fishing nets. Almost exactly a year ago today (Earth Day is coming up, folks), Apple noted that it was doubling its use of recycled materials in products and pushing to eliminate plastics in packaging by 2025. This morning, the company announced that same deadline to move to 100% recycled cobalt in its batteries, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and MacBooks. Batteries, the company notes, monopolize “a significant majority” of the cobalt the company uses. Cobalt is a rough one — both with regard to mining practices and the metal’s direct impact on those people who do the mining. Here’s a Guardian story from 2021 — horrific stuff. In a release issued this morning, Apple notes: Apple has significantly expanded the use of 100 percent certified recycled cobalt over the past three years, making it possible to include in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025. In 2022, a quarter of all cobalt found in Apple products came from recycled material, up from 13 percent the previous year. Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple The move follows similar initiatives for key materials including aluminum, tungsten and rare earth metals. It’s also more broadly a piece of Apple’s long-standing push to carbon neutrality by 2030. “Our ambition to one day use 100 percent recycled and renewable materials in our products works hand in hand with Apple 2030: our goal to achieve carbon neutral products by 2030,” says VP Lisa Jackson. “We’re working toward both goals with urgency and advancing innovation across our entire industry in the process.” A big piece of the puzzle is, naturally, recycling cobalt from older, end of life devices. Five years back, the company implemented its Daisy robotic arm, which strips and separates materials from iPhones. Says Apple: Since 2019, Apple estimates that more than 11,000 kilograms of cobalt have been recovered from batteries extracted by Daisy and then returned to the secondary market. Daisy also helps recover rare earth elements, which are largely lost through traditional electronics recycling processes. Another interesting note, in light of Apple’s XR ambitions, is the “overhead projector-based augment reality system” (seen at the top of the post) it’s been shipping to partners, in order to guide human workers through the disassembly process."
412,YouTube Music officially rolls out podcasts for listeners in the US,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 27, 2023","YouTube Music is officially adding podcasts to its platform in the United States on Android, iOS and the web. The rollout comes a few months after YouTube podcasting head Kai Chuk revealed that podcasts would be added to YouTube Music soon. The update allows users watching podcasts on the main app to continue listening to them on YouTube Music. The company notes that all users can listen to podcasts on-demand, offline, in the background, and while casting and can seamlessly switch between audio-video versions on YouTube Music. “This podcast listening experience is different from our music listening experience where you need a Premium or Music Premium subscription to enjoy some of these features,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This new podcast listening experience complements the podcast video experience on YouTube.” Podcasts in YouTube Music will be available regardless of whether you have a YouTube Premium subscription. YouTube even notes that paying customers may encounter host-read endorsements or sponsorship messages when listening to podcasts on YouTube Music. Image Credits: YouTube Image Credits: YouTube YouTube is rolling out the update to all of its listeners in the United States gradually, which means not everyone may see it yet. The company said it plans to bring podcasts to YouTube Music to users outside the United States soon but didn’t provide any specific launch details. The YouTube Music Home tab now includes a new “Podcasts” tab that takes you to a dedicated feed, which will display your favorite podcasts and recommended episodes. YouTube is advising creators that if their podcast is audio-only, they should consider uploading a video with a static image or use audiograms or other dynamic video formats. The company notes that it will soon offer creators the option to directly upload their audio podcasts via RSS feeds to both YouTube and YouTube Music. According to previous reports, YouTube isn’t looking to sign exclusive deals with podcasters, which has been a key strategy at Spotify. YouTube instead seems to be focused on melding the experience of listening to podcasts on video and audio.  "
413,Cosmonic launches its WebAssembly PaaS into open beta,['@fredericl'],"April 18, 2023","Cosmonic, the company behind the open source wasmCloud project, today announced that its WebAssembly (Wasm) platform-as-a-service offering is now in public beta. In this open beta, Cosmonic is also introducing a number of new features that aim to make integrating Wasm into existing applications easier, including Cosmonic Connect Kubernetes, which makes integrating existing Kubernetes clusters and WebAssembly applications running in Cosmonic a lot easier. The company was co-founded by Liam Randall, who previously founded Critical Stack, one of the first Kubernetes companies, which was acquired by Capital One. He also worked on projects like Cloud Custodian, which Capital One then donated to the CNCF, and later joined Stacklet, which aimed at commercializing Cloud Custodian. “I’m more excited about WebAssembly and Cosmonic than I’ve ever been about anything. I truly believe that we’re going to talk about the next epoch of computing today,” he told me. However, like during the early days of Kubernetes, the Wasm community is also still building out the necessary ecosystem around the core technology to make it palatable to large enterprises. It’s possible to use Wasm in production, as large companies like Adobe and Cloudflare have shown, but the tooling is still very rudimentary. And for a lot of teams, the focus for WebAssembly is functions-as-a-service (FaaS). That’s definitely an important use case, but the Cosmonic team wants to go beyond that. “A lot of people are really pivoting towards FaaS. It’s all functions,” Cosmonic Engineering Director Taylor Thomas explained. “And you know what, that’s a very good use case. I personally think that within the next three to five years, all FaaS platforms will be using WebAssembly, because it’s just the easiest way to get all the language support. But that’s one little tiny slice of a much bigger picture. And that’s where Cosmonic and wasmCloud really shine. We don’t lock you into a specific platform architecture. We don’t want you to have to say: you have to do this as a FaaS. You can use it as a FaaS, that’s entirely possible, but you can also build monoliths, you can build microservices, you can build event-driven architectures.” The promise of WebAssembly, after all, isn’t that it allows users to build better a FaaS platform, but that developers will be able to write their code once and then run it anywhere — and that’s what Cosmonic wants to focus on, in addition to an emphasis on the WebAssembly component model, which allows developers to assemble their applications’ different components and run that code anywhere — something Cosmonic also emphasizes in its PaaS product. Image Credits: Cosmonic Image Credits: Cosmonic “WebAssembly — and specifically the WebAssembly component model — is poised to be the final abstraction of technology,” Randall said. “It turns application libraries into building blocks and these building blocks aligned to contracts for things like an abstraction for a global database or a key value store or a message queue. And then underneath the hood, at runtime, you can attach those to completely different implementations even in different languages, as long as the interface is the same. This is the final abstraction that all tech has really been searching for for the last 20 years.” Cosmonic’s PaaS is enabled by the wasmCloud application runtime, which Cosmonic donated to the CNCF in 2021. Some of the more than 150 contributors to this project include the likes of Capital One, Volvo, BMW and Intel. Another open source project from Cosmonic is Wadm, a declarative application manager for wasmCloud applications. This takes a model that most developers are familiar with from the cloud-native infrastructure world and extends it to the WebAssembly space. “We think of this like upgrading your car with the latest technology,” said Thomas. “Your car might be years old but it still works great and you really enjoy driving it. But you also really like the idea of a push-button start and a hybrid engine. Wadm allows you to keep what you love about your infrastructure — familiar, easy maintenance, reliable, runs forever — updated with the latest features.”"
414,"Erin Foster, Sara Foster form Oversubscribed Ventures to invest in consumer tech",['@christinemhall'],"April 4, 2023","Five years ago, entrepreneurs, sisters and Favorite Daughter clothing line co-founders Erin Foster and Sara Foster were helping people find their perfect professional and friend matches while co-leading creative for Bumble Bizz and Bumble BFF. Today, they are channeling that energy into finding the perfect companies to invest in with Oversubscribed Ventures. The pair, who are also daughters of music producer David Foster, are general partners investing in early-stage consumer technology and all of the tech to support those brands. They are running the firm with Phil Schwarz, a partner at Corazon Capital, who has known the Fosters for over a decade. “We are constantly looking for investors that can add value to companies in ways that we can’t, and Erin and Sara fit that mold,” Schwarz told TechCrunch. “They have a media platform, a podcast and a show on Netflix. They are co-founders of a company, and not only can they speak to an audience, they want to roll up their sleeves and work closely with companies. That’s a hard combination to find in a world of venture and one that we’ve been looking for.” In May 2022, Oversubscribed Ventures made its intentions known that it was raising a $20 million fund. That has not yet closed, and the firm declined to disclose any details about the fundraising. The Fosters are among a number of new emerging fund managers who have started venture capital firms and are raising their first fund, joining Ovni Capital, Emblem, New Fare Partners, Venture Guides, The Family Fund and Phenomenal Ventures. Oversubscribed Ventures made investments in six companies so far, including bachelorette party planning app Bach, boxed wine company Juliet, home manicure machine 10Beauty, skincare startup Exponent, infant formula company Nara Organics and NFT marketplace OpenSea. They have plans to expand the portfolio throughout 2023. TechCrunch spoke to Erin Foster, Sara Foster and Phil Schwarz about the firm’s beginnings and what makes them unique investors. The following was lightly edited for length and clarity. TC: We are curious — what does running creative for a dating app look like? EF: We also had the same question when we were hired. In 2017, met Whitney Wolfe at a Bumble Hive event in New York. It was supposed to be a one-time thing and we just had really great chemistry. Whitney was growing her business, and she really is a trailblazer. In the real sense of the word where she likes to do things differently without looking around to see what else everybody else is doing. She said she wanted us to work with her at Bumble in a role as creative directors. And she admitted who knows what that means right now. This is 2017 when people from entertainment weren’t really coming over and working with tech companies. We didn’t have any references to use as a path of what it should look like, so we made it up as we went along, touching anything creative at the company, like campaigns, events and creative ways to get people to learn about what Bumble Bizz is or what Bumble BFF. What got you both thinking of starting Oversubscribed Ventures? EF: Phil Schwarz, who is running the firm with us, brought us into the workout company Mirror, and with equity in Bumble and that company, we started to grow this little arm of our work life. We really liked it, and it was successful. Both of those companies had really large, splashy exits and acquisitions. Then we started getting a lot of incoming business and a lot of opportunities at really great companies to invest early to get advisory shares. We weren’t able or comfortable writing personal checks that were a big enough size to have real ownership, but we were doing a lot of work for these companies. So we were owning this like tiny, little sliver of something but putting a lot of effort behind it. We realized that we should try to do it on a larger scale with other people’s money because that’s always more fun. SF: We really wanted to raise money because we had a problem. We were getting real allocations and companies were coming to us asking if we could do for them what we did at Bumble and Mirror. We did start writing $25,000 checks, $50,000 checks and getting advisor shares, but that adds up when we just have very little skin in the game. It was hard to get allocations that we can’t fill, so Oversubscribed was really born out of a need. We really did need money, so we were like all right, let’s just do it.   How are you translating the Bumble and Favorite Daughter experiences into being venture capitalists?  EF: Between our podcast, Favorite Daughter, our investments and a lot of our speaking engagements, we really feel connected to women. That’s really been the through line that has helped us. We didn’t go to business school so we can’t list for you the reasons why we knew that we’d be able to do this or why we are able to do it. It really is based on an instinct of us trying to be really self-aware and pay attention to what women are talking about around us and paying attention to the consumers. SF: Our sweet spot is we really like to get our hands dirty working with the founders in our portfolio companies. That is where our skill set is most valuable. We’re not valuable to a Series D company, but we are at that seed stage. It’s the same skill set that we use to build Favorite Daughter, which is profitable year two. What are you looking for in an investment? EF: It comes down to a feeling, like any relationship. Do we connect with the founder? Do we believe them? Do we trust them? Can we imagine that person going into a room and selling someone on this thing? Can we imagine them being able to handle the pressure about being a founder? It has to be something that we can see ourselves using and that we can tell our audience about. If we can’t speak to our audience about it, it doesn’t make sense. Even if it’s going to be successful, we pass on it because we’re not a huge fund, so we’re there to be strategic. SF: You catch yourself in these situations where you get an intro to a founder, and it’s through someone you really respect and really exciting people are already on the cap table. However, they have to think we would be an asset and want us there. To that point, why should founders pick you as their investment partner? EF: We have a really good track record. We don’t have companies that we’ve worked with that haven’t had success and had great numbers to show for it. We feel confident that, like in anything, the right relationship will land for them and for us. We’re not for everyone, and that’s okay. Not everybody wants an outside-of-the-box concept. Not everyone wants to work with a firm that has two people running it that have an unconventional way of doing things. But if you do, then great.   What kind of technology are you all fascinated by? EF: We like technology that touches another category that we are familiar with. We invested in a company called 10Beauty, and it’s a robotic manicure system. The tech behind it is really fascinating. It’s a hardware company, but it’s also a software company. We’ve been on a journey with them for more than two years, and it’s something that we really can see infiltrating our friend group and our houses. Post-pandemic, women are going to the nail salon, but you read all these articles about using the UV lights and getting a nail infection. People want to do things at home more and so this, to us, is really innovative and the kind of tech that we really would love to be a part of. SF: Bach is purely software, and it’s the kind of thing that our audience just understands. If they get it, they want to use it right now. It’s owning the bachelorette party space, and the roadmap is exactly our sweet spot. The goal is for Bach to own group travel. That’s the kind of tech that excites us. There still aren’t many women-led VC firms. How do you see Oversubscribed making waves here? EF: Hopefully we make really exciting and cool investments that stand out, and people recognize that we’re new in this space and have a good instinct for it. SF: Also, we’re not trying to be super loud. It’s really sexy and cool to be a venture investor right now or an investor period. We are kind of trying to keep our heads down, work really closely with our founders and then you’ll see it when it’s successful. We have great relationships with our founders, and it’s the most exciting when they all seem happy. So that makes us happy.  "
415,"Casper co-founders want to sell you another box. This time, it’s a battery",['@tdechant'],"April 11, 2023","A few years ago, mattress company Casper’s co-founders Philip Krim and Jeff Chapin were banging their heads against the wall. Krim was in Long Island in New York while Chapin was in Wyoming. The weather in New York can be pretty different from that in Wyoming, but when bad storms roll through, they both suffer power outages. “I spent most of COVID out on Long Island, where the power lines are old,” Krim told TechCrunch+. “They would go down through bad storms. I had solar, and my wife’s like, ‘We have solar, why do we lose power?’ I’m like, ‘Well, we don’t have a battery.’ I tried to add a battery. I struck out with three different electricians. I called the people who installed our solar; they said we would not roll trucks just for a battery,” he said. “And then I called Jeff because he’s smart and honest. I’m like, ‘How do I do this?’ He was like, ‘It’s really frickin’ hard.’” Chapin’s experience hadn’t been much better. After moving to Wyoming, he grew concerned that his home would be without heat if, during a blizzard, the nearby cottonwood trees started shedding limbs onto the power lines. “That’s how they survive in a windy climate: They drop branches,” he said. His neighbor was a solar installer, so the process should have been easier than it had been for Krim. But his neighbor’s company would only install batteries alongside solar panels, and Chapin’s roof was too complex and shaded to work for solar. After the two spoke, they knew they were onto something. “Given my background,” said Chapin, a former IDEO designer, “when you run into a consumer experience that is near impossible to navigate through, it generally means there’s a new process or system that can be designed. And there’s probably a business opportunity there.”"
416,Eclipse eclipses previous fundraises with a whopping $1.23 billion across two new funds,['@cookie'],"April 10, 2023","The market may be be tightening, but not for Eclipse, a Palo Alto-based venture firm that just raised $1.2 billion across two new funds. One fund, with $720 million in capital commitments, will be invested in early-stage outfits, as well as startups that Eclipse itself incubates. The remaining $510 million will be funneled into growth-stage companies, including outfits that have never before raised outside capital but that also fit into Eclipse’s broader themes. The vehicles bring the firm’s capital under management to $4 billion. That’s a lot for a venture firm that was founded just eight years ago, but apparently, Eclipse’s ongoing pitch — that legacy industries need to modernize how they operate in order stay competitive — is resonating with its investors. As firm founder Lior Susan explains it, “The thing that I always talk about is automation in general because there is just so much opportunity. So you know, 45% of the world’s GDP is blue-collar wages. But there are not enough truck drivers or warehouse workers or agricultural workers or construction workers in the world, and we’ll see even fewer as more people retire. All will be replaced by automation, and we intend to build a lot of those companies in those markets.” There are many ways to pull traditional industries into the 21st century, judging by Eclipse’s wide-ranging portfolio. One of its biggest bets, for example, is on Bright Machines, a still-private company that looks to ensure that all the different components in a factory are connected to a central control system that can monitor and manage their operations in real time. Eclipse also backed Enovix, a company that went public through a special purpose acquisition company last year and is producing lithium-ion batteries for small devices like smart watches, as well as 3D cell technology and batteries for electric vehicles. Eclipse was also an early investor in Lucira, a company focused on developing and commercializing infectious disease test kits. (It staged a traditional IPO in early 2021 when COVID was still rampant.) To find out a bit more about how Eclipse is looking at the world right now — and how all that fresh capital might be deployed — we hopped on the phone this morning with Susan, who spent eight years in the Israel Defense Forces before selling a company he helped his brother build, then deciding to launch his own venture firm. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity. TC: You just announced two funds, one of which is a growth fund. Why not just raise a bigger flagship fund? LS: We think there is a massive opportunity for Eclipse at the early growth stage, and not just at the early stage. Our first bet from this new fund, for example, is Watchmaker Genomics, a company that will accelerate pharma manufacturing using enzymes and automation. Justin, one of our partners, knew the team for a couple of years; they’d bootstrapped the business to advanced revenue and traction after selling their previous company to Roche for $1.2 billion, and we kind of elbowed our way in because they wanted someone to help them accelerate their manufacturing. We invested alongside Decheng Capital, which is an expert in the world of biotech. Are you really interested in healthcare or are you more focused on startups that improve back-end processes, no matter the industry or vertical? We have a whole healthcare infrastructure thesis around investing in picks and shovels on the manufacturing side and in terms of logistics and the supply chain. We have amazing companies, including Rune Labs, Nucleus and a few others that are building picks and shovels and automation for the worlds of pharma. Nucleus [RadioPharma] is a company that you co-created with the Mayo Clinic. Eclipse has incubated other companies, too. Is this strategy changing as the market softens and opportunities become available elsewhere? Not at all. Our model is impacted by the size of the opportunity, and $75 trillion out of the world’s $100 trillion GDP is going to undergo a digital transformation. I’ve been saying that for eight years, and I think everyone now agrees with us — the government, other investors, the public markets. Everyone wants to be Elon Musk. Everyone wants to build cars and rockets and to solve tough problems. So our incubation strategy has been driven by the size of the opportunity more than anything else. One of the companies you helped to create, Bright Machines, raised some debt funding from Silicon Valley Bank back in November after it decided to scrap plans to go public. How has SVB’s implosion impacted Bright Machines and Eclipse more broadly? We’d been working closely with Silicon Valley Bank from the firm’s establishment. Naturally, I don’t know enough to comment on how they ran the bank. I will tell you that the people over there were incredible and that the work that they did for the broader ecosystem of startups, not only for Eclipse, was incredible, so on a personal note, I’m sad to see [its demise]. On the business side, I think because it’s going to leave a vacuum in this market, there is a whole suite of new opportunities [that will emerge from this]. I think we will see new entrants in this market. We’re also thinking personally about what we should do, to tell you the truth, because there are extraordinary opportunities to provide not only equity but also non-dilutive capital in this world. Wait — you’re thinking about providing debt to your own companies? Not yet, not yet. That’s still above my pay grade. But you know, as an investor and operator, you always need to think about the opportunities currently in front of you."
417,‘Star Wars: The Bad Batch’ final and third season will debut on Disney+ in 2024,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 10, 2023","At the Star Wars Celebration in London, Lucasfilm announced that “Star Wars: The Bad Batch” will return for a third and final season on Disney+ in 2024. The company did not provide an exact release date. The series follows Clone Force 99, also known as the Bad Batch, which is a group of elite clones in the aftermath of Order 66 and the rise of the Empire. The end of Season 2 left fans reeling after the death of team member Tech and the capture of Omega.  The company made the announcement on the fourth day the Star Wars Celebration 2023 event. On Friday, Lucasfilm announced that Star Wars spinoff “The Acolyte” will premiere on Disney+ in 2024. The series is set at the end of the High Republic era before the events of the main Star Wars films. Amandla Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae will be starring in the leading roles. Lucasfilm also announced today that the “Ahsoka” series will debut in August of 2023. The upcoming shows will join the growing list of live-action Star Wars series on Disney+, which include “The Mandalorian,” “Andor” and “The Book of Boba Fett.” In addition, the company revealed that the second season of “Andor” will debut in August 2024. Lucasfilm also announced three Star Wars films, one of which will feature the return of Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film will take place 15 years after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker” and center around Rey forming a new Jedi Order. One of the movies will go back to the dawn of the Jedi, while the third film will focus on the New Republic, and close out the interconnected stories told in “The Mandalorian,” “The Book of Boba Fett,” “Ahsoka” and other Disney+ series. Disney and Lucasfilm haven’t revealed release dates for any of these films.  "
418,Alternative seafood startup Aqua Cultured Foods reels in $5.5M,['@christinemhall'],"April 6, 2023","Venture capital investors focused on food tech are calling 2023 the year when alternative seafood startups will make notable strides. Meanwhile, investors expect 40 investments to be made in this sector this year, up from 36 in 2022, according to the Good Food Institute’s annual investor report. Within the past year, TechCrunch reported on a number of those investments into startups producing alternatives to traditional seafood. For example, one of the biggest venture capital investments into alternative seafood in 2022 went into Wildtype, which raised $100 million in a Series B round for its cultured salmon product. Meanwhile, New School Foods, Plantish, Bluu Seafood and the ISH Company also announced funding. Today, Chicago-based Aqua Cultured Foods is adding itself to that list, announcing $5.5 million in seed funding to bring its pipeline of cultivated seafood alternatives to market. Prior to starting the company, co-founder and CEO Anne Palermo was in finance, but always had an interest in health and wellness, so when the opportunity presented itself, she decided to go back to school to learn about product development and science.   “Shrimp” dumpling. Image Credits: Aqua Cultured Foods “Shrimp” dumpling. Image Credits: Aqua Cultured Foods Following that, she started her first health snack company that leveraged proprietary formulations of a high protein snack through the use of protein isolates. “It was really during the development of that product in particular that I got into the alternative protein set scene because it helped me to understand that there are a lot of alternative proteins that are not highly refined and do not come from animals,” Palermo said. After learning about the microbial fermentation process for making food, Palermo decided to focus on seafood, explaining that “it is the most unstable supply chain of any animal protein,” due to things like the rise of the middle class and the increase in demand because of population growth in regions like China and Southeast Asia where seafood is the No. 1 protein consumed per capita. However, overfishing and climate change is depleting the supply of fish, and “after really seeing and identifying what’s going on, I knew that we had to come up with a really fantastic product that could meet the look, texture, nutrition and commercial scale be able to eat it and to make the maximum global impact,” Palermo said. Aqua Cultured Foods is creating whole-muscle cut seafood alternatives, including calamari, shrimp, scallops and filets of tuna and whitefish. The company also produces minced “seafood” fillings for applications like dumplings, ravioli and sushi rolls. “Just texturally speaking, there’s nothing like it,” Palermo said. “It is nearly indistinguishable from tuna when it is inside of a maki roll. It is nearly indistinguishable from scallops. The products are currently optimized to be raw, and the texture is just so beautiful and silky. It’s quite an accomplishment.” Palermo was mum on exactly how the technology worked, but did say the company was using proprietary mycoprotein (fungi) fermentation processes that don’t include any animal inputs, genetic altering or modification. She also said this process yields food with a lower price point to narrow the gap in price parity with traditional seafood. “Aqua created novel processes and methods of production based on technologies and products that have existed for thousands of years, so we don’t have the same regulatory hurdles as other types of technologies have,” Palermo said. “They are already generally recognized as safe by the FDA. It’s part of the reason that we’re able to have such an accelerated market and be able to have so many really fantastic tastings.” Aqua’s new investment was led by Stray Dog Capital and included H Ventures, Aztec Capital Management and Amplifica Capital, which joined existing investors Supply Change Capital, Big Idea Ventures, Hyde Park Angels, Aera VC, Kingfisher Capital and Swiss Pampa. The round also included a strategic investment from Asian food manufacturer and distributor CJ CheilJedang. In total, Aqua has raised just over $8 million, Palermo said.   Brittany Chibe, Aqua’s co-founder and chief growth officer, has been in the food industry for over a decade and said the new funding will enable the company to begin manufacturing its first products by early summer. That will include tuna, scallops and ground shrimp. The company recently acquired a 5,000-square-foot food-grade facility in Chicago, almost nearly built out, for its pilot facility. Palermo expects Aqua to be able to grow between 5,000 and 10,000 pounds of product in a 450-square-foot space. “What that does is open us up to have decentralized manufacturing,” Palermo said. “When we eventually do move into new markets, for example, Asia, we’re going to be able to have a grow facility in Asia and we won’t have to ship products from the U.S. That’s a big area where we differentiate as well as just the inherent scalability of our products.” Aqua will also use the investment in hiring additional employees and expanding its roster of restaurant and foodservice outlets for product introductions this year. Chibe said the company sees “a path to quickly reach commercial scale,” and will respond to inbound interest from chefs with some initial pop-up shops to see how it goes. “We’re not really sure what demand looks like, so if we can dedicate one weekend to specific restaurants, we will know about how much of it they’re going to sell,” Chibe said. “Then we can produce it ahead of time to get exactly what they need.”  "
419,Payday wants to power the future of work for Africa with $3M seed led by Moniepoint Inc,['@ulonnaya'],"March 29, 2023","Payday, a neobank issuing global (USD, EUR and GBP) accounts to Africans, has raised $3 million to fuel its “future of work” initiative through borderless payment alternatives in major currencies. The seed round was led by Moniepoint Inc (formerly TeamApt Inc), the U.S. entity that houses Moniepoint Microfinance Bank and TeamApt Nigeria. Techstars, Angels Touch, HoaQ, DFS Lab’s Stellar Africa Fund, Ingressive Capital Fund II and angel investors such as MFS Africa chief Dare Okoudjou and Norebase CEO Tola Onayemi also participated. When Favour Ori launched Payday in June 2021, the initial play was to build PayPal for Africa, for which it secured a million dollars in pre-seed funding. Customers in 11 African countries, including Rwanda, where it first established its headquarters due to its business-friendly environment, had access to the platform and could send money to each other. Subsequently, the fintech, which became the first Rwandan company to join Techstars (Toronto program) and soon raised a $1.2 million pre-seed extension, learned that enabling cross-border payments was expensive despite. As such, it shut down nine corridors and focused on Nigeria, where it has since witnessed tremendous transaction volume and user growth. With Payday, African remote workers and freelancers, particularly in Nigeria and Rwanda, can send and receive money in USD, GBP, EUR and 20 other currencies. This allows them and those in the diaspora who work remotely for international organizations to be paid and withdraw money in their choice of currency. Payday also offers virtual dollar and naira cards (which allow Nigerian users to purchase goods and services on foreign platforms), currency swaps, payment links, local bill payments and peer-to-peer transfers. These features are commonly provided by other VC-backed B2C fintech apps serving African customers and those in the diaspora, such as Grey, Lemonade Finance, Send by Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash, making the landscape a competitive one where each attempts to outdo the other with speed and better fees or rates. “We are building TransferWise for Africa; we want our customers to move money faster with the bank accounts and cards we issue. Other platforms focus on Africans in the diaspora; we’re focusing on people in Africa while planning to focus on those abroad by expanding to the U.K.,” Ori told TechCrunch during an interview about Payday’s place in Africa’s remittance and global neobanking space. “We were the first startup to start issuing virtual accounts in Africa around June 2021, and we’ve done this for over 20 months, so we know what works and understand our market and users.” Payday ramped up its social media marketing push over the last few months to increase market share, which seems to be paying off. The fintech ended 2022 with slightly over 100,000 users, and now offers its virtual cards and other products to more than 300,000 users. Payday also processes an average of 40,000 transactions daily and over $25 million monthly, numbers that have fetched the fintech a $15 million acquisition offer by one of the continent’s unicorns, which, Ori says, was turned down. Image Credits: Payday Image Credits: Payday The fintech’s burn rate has tripled as a result of extensive marketing. However, Ori claims that the company has remained profitable since August 2022 and its monthly revenues have quadrupled owing to its increasing user base. Similarly, the two-year-old startup became a payment partner for SpaceX’s Starlink, enabling users in Nigeria and Rwanda to purchase Starlink routers. “At Moniepoint, we’re excited about the unique things Favour and the team are doing with PayDay. Personally, I connect deeply with his drive, technical depth and desire to execute. This is something that isn’t very common, and the urge to encourage that fire inspired us to want to be a part of this,” Moniepoint CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said. “There’s also the alignment in our goal to provide financial happiness by addressing key international payment pain points with merchants and individuals. We see a potential to leverage their infrastructure to further deepen our suite of financial services for merchants as well, and we’re looking forward to all that’s to come.”   Having raised over $5 million since its inception, Payday will now look to secure operational licensing in the U.K. and Canada while building out operations in the former, where the startup has recently been incorporated. The Kigali and Vancouver-based fintech will also intensify its marketing efforts while hiring more talent as it looks to expand from 35 to 50 employees in the coming weeks. It already made fresh additions to its founding and executive team, which initially comprised Ori, who ran Payday all by himself for 18 months. Elijah Kingson has joined the company as co-founder and CPO from global fintech Revolut, while Yvonne Obike, now COO and co-founder at the company, had previous stints with Nigeria’s Bank of Industry. Sean Udeke, an ex–Goldman Sachs and Expedia product manager, works at the fintech as its new head of products, where he is slated to oversee new offerings such as loans and credit cards. “We’re supporting the future of work by targeting remote workers and freelancers, and we want to be able to study customer and spend behaviors and use that to offer loans,” said Ori, who also ran the now-defunct tech outsourcing platform WeJapa. “That’s going to be the future for us. We also want to issue credit cards, where if you’re a student trying to go to the U.S., you can start building your credit from Nigeria with Payday.”"
420,Stability AI releases ChatGPT-like language models,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 19, 2023","Stability AI, the startup behind the generative AI art tool Stable Diffusion, today open sourced a suite of text-generating AI models intended to go head to head with systems like OpenAI’s GPT-4. Called StableLM and available in “alpha” on GitHub and Hugging Face, a platform for hosting AI models and code, Stability AI says that the models can generate both code and text and “demonstrate how small and efficient models can deliver high performance with appropriate training.” “Language models will form the backbone of our digital economy, and we want everyone to have a voice in their design,” the Stability AI team wrote in a blog post on the company’s site. The models were trained on a dataset called The Pile, a mix of internet-scraped text samples from websites including PubMed, StackExchange and Wikipedia. But Stability AI claims it created a custom training set that expands the size of the standard Pile by 3x. Image Credits: Stability AI Image Credits: Stability AI Stability AI didn’t say in the blog post whether the StableLM models suffer from the same limitations as others, namely a tendency to generate toxic responses to certain prompts and hallucinate (i.e. make up) facts. But given that The Pile contains profane, lewd and otherwise fairly abrasive language, it wouldn’t be surprising if that were the case. This reporter tried to test the models on Hugging Face, which provides a front end to run them without having to configure the code from scratch. Unfortunately, I got an “at capacity” error every time, which might have to do with the size of the models — or their popularity. “As is typical for any pretrained large language model without additional fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, the responses a user gets might be of varying quality and might potentially include offensive language and views,” Stability AI wrote in the repo for StableLM. “This is expected to be improved with scale, better data, community feedback and optimization.” Still, the StableLM models seem fairly capable in terms of what they can accomplish — particularly the fine-tuned versions included in the alpha release. Tuned using a Stanford-developed technique called Alpaca on open source datasets, including from AI startup Anthropic, the fine-tuned StableLM models behave like ChatGPT, responding to instructions (sometimes with humor) such as “write a cover letter for a software developer” or “write lyrics for an epic rap battle song.” The number of open source text-generating models grows practically by the day, as companies large and small vie for visibility in the increasingly lucrative generative AI space. Over the past year, Meta, Nvidia and independent groups like the Hugging Face-backed BigScience project have released models roughly on par with “private,” available-through-an-API models such as GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude. Some researchers have criticized the release of open source models along the lines of StableLM in the past, arguing that they could be used for unsavory purposes like creating phishing emails or aiding malware attacks. But Stability AI argues that open-sourcing is in fact the right approach, in fact. “We open-source our models to promote transparency and foster trust. Researchers can ‘look under the hood’ to verify performance, work on interpretability techniques, identify potential risks and help develop safeguards,” Stability AI wrote in the blog post. “Open, fine-grained access to our models allows the broad research and academic community to develop interpretability and safety techniques beyond what is possible with closed models.” Image Credits: Stability AI Image Credits: Stability AI There might be some truth to that. Even gatekept, commercialized models like GPT-4, which have filters and human moderation teams in place, have been shown to spout toxicity. Then again, open source models take more effort to tweak and fix on the back end — particularly if developers don’t keep up with the latest updates. In any case, Stability AI hasn’t shied away from controversy, historically. The company is in the crosshairs of legal cases that allege that it infringed on the rights of millions of artists by developing AI art tools using web-scraped, copyrighted images. And a few communities around the web have tapped Stability’s tools to generate pornographic celebrity deepfakes and graphic depictions of violence. Moreover, despite the philanthropic tone of its blog post, Stability AI is also under pressure to monetize its sprawling efforts — which run the gamut from art and animation to biomed and generative audio. Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque has hinted at plans to IPO, but Semafor recently reported that Stability AI — which raised over $100 million in venture capital last October at a reported valuation of more than $1 billion — “is burning through cash and has been slow to generate revenue.”"
421,Your site needs more than just one user onboarding experience,['@jon4growth'],"May 1, 2023","Many data-driven startups have uncovered that having one single user onboarding experience can ultimately make or break them. This is what I call the single onboarding misconception. Take Twitter as a prime example of a company that has spent countless resources to perfect their onboarding flow so that it’s unique for every user. Upon signing up, the site asks the new user to select people they are interested in following. Immediately, they can have a rich feed that’s custom tailored to their liking. This is no different for any other B2C or B2B startup. If you’re just starting up, it shouldn’t be a top priority to customize onboarding experiences, but there are multiple low-lift items that can be initially implemented. I’ll describe how to think about the type of data needed to make onboarding unique and share some examples of how I’ve implemented this myself. Experience has convinced me that without a multipath onboarding experience, startups cannot reach their full potential. Recently, I encountered various fintech cryptocurrency exchanges that ask for a customer’s “Experience Level” with cryptocurrency. What I haven’t seen as prominently is a personalized experience based on the answer to this question. Initial data collected during acquisition through a lead form or during sign-up for a product will help fuel a multi-onboarding experience. During my time with the growth team at Coinbase, many of our lifecycle email and push campaigns were designed to be triggered based on the user’s behavior. While this wasn’t a fully personalized experience, we made sure to tailor our communications based on the in-app behaviors of the users. If a user was a power trader (if they had a high volume of trades, for example), we would send emails on ETH staking, liquidity pools and more advanced cryptocurrency investment actions. When thinking about the type of data necessary to bucket users into a specific journey, ask yourself this essential question: What are my consumer personas? Based on the response you receive to this question, you’ll be able to determine which questions are needed to help you segment users during their onboardings. Some of the foundational variables to include early on are: Each startup should have its own unique flavor of questions to ask, but if you’re stuck, select from the list of examples provided above as a start. These will ultimately shed light on the question of which customer persona you’re acquiring."
422,SpaceX launches fully stacked Starship for the first time,['@etherington'],"April 20, 2023","SpaceX has launched its fully stacked version of Starship, including the upper stage and the Super Heavy booster, for the first time. The combined launch vehicle stands at nearly 400 feet tall, and the launch today included a successful lift-off, plus ascent all the way to and through the crucial Max Q period, which is the point of the launch during which the vehicle is under the most stress. The test went surprisingly smoothly for a first flight of an orbital rocket — right up until the point where the first stage was meant to separate from the upper stage. At that point in the flight, the first stage continued to fire its engines and the upper stage did not separate or light up its own engines as intended. SpaceX also noted on their webcast that it looked like three of the Raptor engines that power the booster may not have fired, but that didn’t seem to negatively affect the initial lift-off and ascent. All told, this should definitely be considered a success: SpaceX founder Elon Musk had said previously that there was essentially a significant chance Starship wouldn’t even make it off the pad on this first try. SpaceX’s Kate Tice said on the live broadcast that the team would consider anything beyond getting off the pad a win in this instance, with the primary goal of the flight being to capture key data about the vehicle in order to increase its chances of success for future orbital flights. The flight today ended with both stages engulfed in a large explosion effectively destroying the entire vehicle. SpaceX noted that the flight path today was intentionally set over land and water that was cleared of human presence for safety in case of any falling debris. SpaceX said it’ll provide more info about the test flight and its results as it investigates more about what occurred during the launch. "
423,Smile Identity expands African footprint with acquisition of Appruve to strengthen ID verification services,['@ulonnaya'],"April 26, 2023","Smile Identity, a KYC compliance and ID verification partner for many African fintechs and businesses, has acquired Inclusive Innovations, the parent company of Appruve, a Ghanaian developer of identity verification software. In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Smile Identity said it is “actively fulfilling regulatory requirements to finalize the transaction for the [Inclusive Innovation] affiliated entities in Africa.” This strategic acquisition will expand Smile Identity’s footprint across Africa and solidify its position as the continent’s leading identity verification and digital KYC provider, a part of the statement read. While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, sources close to the matter say the cash-and-stock deal was “not more than $20 million,” with a large chunk as stock. As fintech services proliferate across different African markets, the need to have sufficient KYC and identity verification processes in place has intensified amid increasing fraud challenges and more stringent regulatory requirements. Founded by Mark Straub and William Bares in 2017, Smile Identity is a major player in Africa’s ID verification and KYC compliance industry. Buoyed by venture capital investment of more than $30 million (including a recently announced $20 million Series B) and backed by investors such as Costanoa Ventures, Future Africa and Norrsken22, among others, the company has built its business by combining document verification, face verification, biometrics, and data integrations into local trusted ID authorities to verify people’s identities. Other prominent use cases include AML checks, customer onboarding and fraud prevention. On the other hand, Appruve, which provides an API that verifies user identity, fraud detection and digital documentation, primarily focuses on new datasets that enable or complement traditional government data such as international passports and national IDs. Within the last 18 months, the four-year-old startup worked on analyzing fraud data from global money networks, verification of mobile money financial statements and blocklist data from various banks and fintechs within the last 18 months. (The four-year-old digital verification upstart has received less than $500,000 in venture capital funding since its inception as well as $450,000 in grant money from DFS Lab through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google’s launchpad studio accelerator, and others.) “These are relevant localized data that have long been left out of the bigger pool of KYC and fraud prevention. It’s these capabilities, experience, and know-how that we are bringing on board, working together with Smile, which just launched an AML product, to build a fully comprehensive product and solution for the market,” said Appruve founder and CEO Paul Damalie on what his startup brings to Smile Identity’s table.   Here’s also how it fits into Smile Identity’s current growth strategy from a product but geographic-led standpoint. Document verification and face recognition and matching comprise Smile Identity’s base-level product that works across Africa. While the platform has added depth in some markets with more advanced fintech regions, such as Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, where it can query against government databases, such depth is lacking in other markets, including Francophone Africa. In a February interview, Straub noted that Smile Identity would use the growth capital it had secured to expand its KYC capabilities into the market, among other things. Thus, in addition to supplying Smile Identity with a skilled and experienced team, APIs and customers, Appruve presents the Costanoa-backed KYC identity provider with a gateway into the Francophone market (focusing on Ivory Coast and Senegal) and also Uganda, Straub told TechCrunch over a call. “We have product depth in Nigeria already. We’re interested in replicating the product depth to more markets and realizing our ambitions to have product depth for all of Africa,” Straub said on the call. “Fraud data, mobile money data, government data queried against national ID systems, AML, PEP screening checks, sanction screening, both global and local KYB business verification data. We want to add that depth in more markets, and Appruve gives some of that.” Smile Identity, according to its statement, said the Appruve acquisition — which expands its suite of APIs, including mobile money, data, and anti-fraud checks — will allow it to “cover over 1 billion Africans, the African diaspora, and 100 million African businesses, supporting over 230 documents and data types with integration options for every device and operating system combination in Africa.” Before the acquisition, Smile Identity had just crossed over 60 million verifications. Meanwhile, Appruve processed up to 100,000 verifications monthly, Damalie disclosed in the interview. Straub asserts that the combination of Smile Identity and its new subsidiary Appruve alongside the intervention of other KYC and AML services, will help decrease the potential for fraud despite increased usage of digital wallets, banking apps, and mobile money services across the continent. He added that protecting consumers’ data is paramount to Smile Identity’s business, and both Smile and Appruve “have been working diligently to achieve and maintain the appropriate licensing regimes where required and various data protection policies.” In line with that, Damalie, who will now head international expansion efforts for Smile Identity, says, in a couple of years, the company sees itself acting as “the digital infrastructure that will enable trust among African businesses” as the intra- and inter-continental movement of goods and services across borders become more pronounced.”  "
424,Activist investor Elliott ditches director nomination plans for Salesforce,['@psawers'],"March 27, 2023","Activist investor Elliott Investment Management won’t be proceeding with plans to nominate its own directors to Salesforce’s board, citing improved performance and a clearer “focus on value creation” from the enterprise software company. Elliott became one of five activist investors within Salesforce’s ranks after news emerged at the turn of the year that it had bought a multi-billion dollar stake in the company. Ahead of Salesforce’s recent Q4 earnings, Elliott confirmed that it was pushing several of its own candidates toward the board after a turbulent 2022 for Salesforce. But after the enterprise software giant returned to financial form, beating growth forecasts, it seems Elliott is now convinced that Salesforce has corrected course. In a joint statement today, the companies said that in light of Salesforce’s recently announced “profitable growth framework,” dubbed “New Day,” alongside its strong fiscal year 2023 and a slew of additional “transformation initiatives,” Elliott won’t pursue its director nominations. “I have great respect for Marc [Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff] and his team, and I have become deeply impressed by their strong ongoing commitment to profitable growth, responsible capital return and an ambitious shareholder value creation plan,” Elliott managing partner Jesse Cohn noted in a press release."
425,Netflix orders its first pilot for comedy series ‘Little Sky’,['@laurenforristal'],"April 3, 2023","Netflix has ordered a TV pilot for the first time in its history, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. The company typically follows the straight-to-series model, so its willingness to greenlight a pilot is certainly notable. The comedy series is titled “Little Sky” and stars “Nine Perfect Strangers” actress Samara Weaving. The series will follow a character named Penelope Paul Porter (Weaving), who wants to prove that she can be a respected on-air news reporter. Porter gets an anonymous tip that the mayor of an eerie, remote town called Little Sky has gone missing. She investigates the story in an effort to get her big break. The creator of the show is Rightor Doyle, who is also directing the pilot. Doyle is known for the Netflix comedy series “Bonding.” Currently, “Little Sky” is the only pilot Netflix has planned. The concept of the show apparently stood out to the company, we’ve learned. The pilot is likely to make sure that the tone and chemistry for a large ensemble show will be successful with subscribers. Deadline was the first to report the pilot order. While the streaming giant is only experimenting with the pilot model and has no plans for a permanent development shift, the move is still significant. Major broadcast networks have ventured away from ordering hundreds of pilots. The number of pilot orders has dwindled significantly, with pilot season 2023 reaching an all-time low. As of February, major broadcast networks only ordered 14 pilots, down from over 30 pilots in 2022. The networks were likely influenced by streamers like Netflix, which began making original titles over a decade ago. Apple TV+ is another streaming service that is known for its straight-to-series order method. Netflix has tried other experiments lately, such as its first livestreamed comedy special with Chris Rock. “Chris Rock: Selective Outrage” reached Netflix’s Global Top 10. The company also plans to restructure its film units and make fewer but better original movies, reported Bloomberg.  "
426,Vint Cerf on the ‘exhilarating mix’ of thrill and hazard at the frontiers of tech,['@techcrunch'],"May 5, 2023","Vint Cerf has been a near-constant influence on the internet since the days when he was helping create it in the first place. Today he wears many hats, among them VP and chief internet evangelist at Google. He is to be awarded the IEEE’s Medal of Honor at a gala in Atlanta, and ahead of the occasion he spoke with TechCrunch in a wide-ranging interview touching on his work, AI, accessibility and interplanetary internet. TechCrunch: To start out with, can you tell us how Google has changed in your time there? Cerf: Well, when I joined the company in 2005, there were 5,000 people already, which is pretty damn big. And of course, my normal attire is three piece suits. The important thing is that I thought I would be raising the sartorial quotient of the company by joining. And now, almost 18 years later, there are 170-some-odd thousand people, and I have failed miserably. So I hope you don’t mind if I take my jacket off. Go right ahead. So as you might have noticed, Sergey has come back to do a little bit more on the artificial intelligence side of things, which is something he’s always been interested in; I would say historically, we’ve always had an interest in artificial intelligence. But that has escalated significantly over the past decade or so. The acquisition of DeepMind was a brilliant choice. And you can see some of the outcomes first of the spectacular stuff, like playing Go and winning. And then the more productive stuff, like figuring out how 200 million proteins are folded up. Then there’s the large language models and the chatbots. And I think we’re still in a very peculiar period of time, where we’re trying to characterize what these things can and can’t do, and how they go off the rails, and how do you take advantage of them to do useful work? How do we get them to distinguish fact from fiction? All of that is in my view open territory, but then that’s always an exciting place to be — a place where nobody’s ever been before. The thrill of discovery and the risk of hazard create a fairly exciting mix — an exhilarating mix. You gave a talk recently about, I don’t want to say the dangers of the large language models, but… Well, I did say there are hazards there. I was talking to a bunch of investment bankers, or VCs, and I said, you know, don’t try to sell stuff to your investors just because it’s flashy and shiny. Be cautious about going too fast and trying to apply it without figuring out how to put guardrails in place. I raised a question of hazard and wanting people to be more thoughtful about which applications made sense. I even suggested an analogy: you know how the Society of Automotive Engineers, they have different risk levels for the self driving cars — a risk level idea could apply to artificial intelligence and machine learning. For entertainment purposes, perhaps it’s not too concerning, unless it goes down some dark path, in which case, you might want to put some friction into the system to deal with that, especially a younger user. But then, as you get to the point where you’re training these things to do medical diagnosis or make investment advice, or make decisions about whether somebody gets out of jail… now suddenly, the risk factors are extremely high. We shouldn’t be unaware of those risk factors. We can, as we build applications, be prepared to detect excursions away from safe territory, so that we don’t accidentally inflict some harm by the use of these kinds of technologies. So we need some kind of guardrails. Again, I’m not expert in this space, but I am beginning to wonder whether we need something kind of like that in order to provide a “super-ego” for the natural language network. So when it starts to go off the rails somewhere, we can observe that that’s happening. And a second network that’s observing both the input and the output might intervene, somehow, and stop the the production of the output. Sort of a conscience function? Well, it’s not quite conscience, it’s closer to executive function — the prefrontal cortex. I want to be careful, I’m only reasoning by metaphor here. I know that Microsoft has embarked on something like this. Their version of GPT-4 has an intermediary model like that, they call it Prometheus.   Purely as an observation, I had the impression that the Prometheus natural language model would detect and intervene if it thought that the interactions were going down with dark path. I thought that they would implement it in such a way that before you actually say something to the interlocutor that is going down the dark path, you intervene and prevent it from going there at all. My impression, though, is that it actually produces the output and then discovers that it’s produced it, but and then it says, “Oh, I shouldn’t have done that. Oh, dear, I take that back,” or “I don’t want to talk to you anymore about that.” It’s a little bit like the email that you get occasionally from the Microsoft Outlook system that says, “This person would like to withdraw the message.” I love when that happens… it makes me want to read the original message so badly, even if I wouldn’t have before. Yeah, exactly. It’s sort of like putting a big red flag in there saying, boy there’s something juicy in here. You mentioned the AI models, that it’s an interesting place to work. Do you get the same sort of foundational flavor that you got from working on protocols and other big shared things over the years? Well, what we are seeing is emergent properties of these large language models, that are not necessarily anticipated. And there have been emergent properties showing up in the protocol world. Flow control in particular is a vast headache in the online packet switch environment, and people have been tackling these problems inside and outside of Google for years. One of the examples of emergent properties that I think very few of us thought about is the domain name business. Once they had value, suddenly, all kinds of emergent properties show up, people with interests that conflict and have to be resolved. Same for internet address space, it’s an even more weird environment where people actually buy IPv4 addresses for like $50 each. I confess to you that as I watched the auctions for IPv4 address space, I was thinking how stupid I was. When I was at the Defense Department in charge of all this, I should have allocated the slash eight, which is 16 million addresses, to myself, and just sit on it, you know, for 50 years, then sell it and retire. Even simple systems have the ability to surprise you. Especially when you have simple systems when a large number of them are interacting with each other. I’ve found myself not necessarily recognizing when these emergent properties will come, but I will say that whenever something gets monetized, you should anticipate there will be emergent properties and possibly unexpected behavior, all driven by greed. Let me ask you about some some other stuff you’re working on. I’m always happy when I see cutting-edge tech being applied to people who need it, people with disabilities, people who like just have not been addressed by the current use cases of tech. Are you still working in the accessibility community? I am very active in the accessibility space. At Google, we have a number of what we call employee resource groups, or ERGs. Yeah, some of them I, executive sponsor for one for Googlers who have hearing problems. And there is a disabilities oriented group, which involves employees who either have disabilities or family members that have disabilities, and they share their stories with each other because often people have similar problems, but don’t know what the solutions were for other people. Also, it’s just nice to know that you’re not alone in some of these challenges. There’s another group called the Grayglers for people that have a little gray in their hair, and I’m the executive sponsor for that. And of course, the focus of attention there is the challenges that arise as you get older, even as you think about retirement and things like that. When a lot of so-called Web 2.0 stuff came out 10 years ago, it was totally inaccessible, broke all the screen readers, all this kind of stuff. Somebody has to step in and say, look, we need to have this standard, or else you’re leaving out millions of people. So I’m always interested to hear about what interesting projects or organizations or people are out there.   What I have come to believe is that engineers, being just given a set of specs that say if you do it this way, it will meet this level of the standard… that doesn’t necessarily produce intuition. You really have to have some intuition in order to make things accessible. So I’ve come to the conclusion that what we really need is to show people examples of something which is not accessible, and something that is, and let them ingest as many examples as we can give them, because their neural networks will eventually figure out, what is it about this design that makes it accessible? And how do I apply that insight into the next design that I do? So, seeing what works and what doesn’t work is really important. And you often learn a lot more from what doesn’t work than you do from what does. There’s a guy named Gregg Vanderheiden, who’s at the University of Maryland, he and I did a two-day event [the Future of Interface Workshop] looking at research on accessibility and trying to frame what this is going to look like over the next 10 or 20 years. It really is quite astonishing what the technology might be able to do to act as an augmenting capability for people that that need assistance. There’s great excitement, but at the same time great disappointment, because we haven’t used it as effectively as I think we could have. It’s kind of like how Alexander Graham Bell invented a telephone that can’t be used by people who are deaf, which is why he was working on it in the first place. It is a funny contradiction of priorities. One thing where I do see some of the the large language and multimodal AI models helping out is that they can describe what they are seeing, even if you can’t see it. I know that one of GPT-4’s first applications was in an application for blind people to view the world around them.   We’re experiencing something close to that right this minute. Since I wear hearing aids, I’m making use of the captioning capability. And at the moment since this is Zoom rather than a Google Meet, there isn’t any setting on this one for closed captioning. I’m exercising the Zoom application through the Chrome browser, and Google has developed a capability for the Chrome browser to detect speech in the incoming sound. So packets are coming in and they’re known to be sound, it passes through an identification system that produces a caption bar, which you can move around on the screen. And that’s been super helpful for me. For cases like this, where the application doesn’t have captioning, or for random video streaming video that might be coming in and hasn’t been captioned, the caption window automatically pops up. In theory, I think we can do this in 100 different languages, although I don’t know that we’ve activated it for more than four or five. As you say, these tools will become more and more normal, and as time goes on, people will expect the system to adapt to their needs. So language translation, and speech recognition is quite powerful, but I do want to mention something that I found vaguely unsettling. Recently, I encountered an example of a conversation between a reporter and a chatbot. But he chose deliberately to take the output of the chat bot and have it spoken by the system. And he chose the style of a famous British explorer [David Attenborough]. The text itself was quite well formed, but coming with Attenborough’s accent just added to the weight of the assertions even when they were wrong. The confidence levels, as I’m sure you’ve seen, are very high, even when the thing doesn’t know what it’s talking about.   The reason I bring this up is that we are allowing in these indicators of, how should we say this, of quality, to fool us. Because in the past, they really did mean it was David Attenborough. But here it’s not, it’s just his voice. I got to thinking about this, and I realized there was an ancient example of exactly this problem that showed up 50 years ago at Xerox PARC. They had a laser printer, and they had the Alto workstation, and the Bravo text editor, it meant the first draft of anything you type to be printed out beautifully formatted with lovely forms and everything else. Normally, you would never see that production quality until after everything had been edited, you know, wrestled with by everybody to get the text formatted, picture-perfect stuff. That meant the first draft stuff came out looking like it was final draft. People didn’t didn’t understand that they were nuts, that they were seeing first-round stuff, and that it wasn’t complete, or necessarily even satisfactory. So it occurred to me that we’ve reached a point now where technology is fooling us into giving it more weight than it deserves, because of certain indicia that used to be indicative of the investment made in producing it. And… I’m not quite sure what to do about that. I don’t think anyone is! I think somehow or another, we need to make it clear what the provenance is of the thing that we’re looking at. Like how we needed to say this is first-draft material, you know, don’t make any assumptions. So provenance turns out to be a very important concept, especially in a world where we have the ability to imbue content with attributes that we would normally interpret in one way. Like, it’s David Attenborough speaking, and we should listen to that. And yet, which have to be, we have to think more critically about them. Because in fact, the attribute is being delivered artificially. And perhaps maliciously. Certainly that too. And this is why critical thinking has become an important skill. But it doesn’t work very well, unless you have enough information to understand the provenance of the material that you’re looking at. I think we are going to have to invest more in provenance and identity in order to evaluate the quality of that which we are experiencing. I wanted to ask you about interplanetary internet, because that whole area is extremely interesting to me. Well, this one, of course, gets started way back in 1998. But I’m a science fiction reader from way back way to age 10 or something, so I got quite excited when it was possible to even think about the possibility of designing and building a communication system that would span the solar system. The team got started very small, and now 25 years later involves many of the space agencies around the world: JAXA, the Korean Space Agency, NASA and so on. And a growing team of people who are either government funded to do space-based research, or volunteers. There’s a special interest group called the interplanetary networking Special Interest Group, which is part of the Internet Society — that thing got started in 1998. But it has now grown to like 900 people around the world who are interested in this stuff. We’ve standardized this stuff, we’re on version seven of it, we’re running it up in the International Space Station. It’s intended to be available for the return to the moon and Artemis missions. I’m not going to see the end result of all this, but I’m going to see the first couple of chapters. And I’m very excited about that, because it’s not crazy to actually think about. Like all my other projects, it takes a long time. Patience and persistence! For something like this it must have been a real challenge, but also a very familiar one. In some ways building something like this is what you’ve been doing your whole career. This is just a different set of restraints and capabilities. You put your finger on it, exactly right. This is in a different parametric space than the one that works for TCP/IP. And we’re still bumping into some really interesting problems, especially where you have TCP/IP networks running on the moon, for example, locally and interconnecting with other internets on other planets, going through the interplanetary protocol. What does that look like? You know, which IP addresses should be used? We have to figure out, well, how the hell does the Domain Name System work in the context of internets that aren’t on the planet? And it’s really fun!"
427,Ask Sophie: Can I launch a startup if I’m in the US on a student visa?,['@Sophie_Alcorn'],"April 19, 2023","Here’s another edition of “Ask Sophie,” the advice column that answers immigration-related questions about working at technology companies. “Your questions are vital to the spread of knowledge that allows people all over the world to rise above borders and pursue their dreams,” says Sophie Alcorn, a Silicon Valley immigration attorney. “Whether you’re in people ops, a founder or seeking a job in Silicon Valley, I would love to answer your questions in my next column.” TechCrunch+ members receive access to weekly “Ask Sophie” columns; use promo code ALCORN to purchase a one- or two-year subscription for 50% off. Dear Sophie, I just found out that I’ve been accepted to an American university, which was my first choice! One day, my dream would be to create my own startup in the U.S. Is there any groundwork I am allowed to lay to make my dream come true? — Forward-Looking Founder Dear Forward-Looking, Congratulations on starting your U.S. journey to make your dreams come true! The United States needs entrepreneurs like you who have the grit, determination and innovative vision to create technologies that improve our world!
I want to launch my own startup in the U.S. If I have a student visa, what groundwork am I allowed to lay to make my dream come true?

However, a word of caution: The F-1 student visa is only for individuals who do not intend to permanently immigrate to the United States. I’ll share more details below. Following through with your studies and graduating will set the stage for you to get an employment authorization document (work permit) so you can embark on fulfilling your dream. Let me start at the beginning and talk about the F-1 student visa. The F-1 student visa is a nonimmigrant visa that enables you to study in the United States at a SEVP-certified school and offers the most options to work both before you graduate and after. For a nonimmigrant visa, you must demonstrate to immigration officials — at visa interviews and when you enter the U.S. at the airport or other port of entry — that you intend to eventually return to your home country. If you express immigrant intent (the intention of remaining in the U.S. permanently), you may be denied an F-1 visa or entry into the U.S. As an international student, you — neither the university admissions office nor the international student office nor the university’s Designated Student Official (DSO) — are responsible for your maintaining legal status. It is strongly recommended that you attend your university’s orientation for international students and stay in close contact with the DSO at your university. A DSO will need to sign off for your work authorization under OPT and STEM OPT. Image Credits: Joanna Buniak / Sophie Alcorn

(opens in a new window) As a full-time F-1 student, you cannot work in the U.S. without proper work authorization. If you do, you risk severe consequences, including denial of future immigration benefits or even removal proceedings. OPT enables you to get a proper work authorization (an Employment Authorization Document, also known as a work permit) to gain practical work experience in your field of study. Students are eligible for up to 12 months of full-time work under OPT either before they graduate (pre-completion OPT) or after they graduate (post-completion OPT)."
428,"Bears abound, but none in sight at Denver’s crypto fest",['@ritacyliao'],"March 23, 2023","It was hard to tell at first from EthDenver — the biggest Ethereum developer conference in the world — that we’re in a bear market. The conference earlier this month attracted some 20,000 attendees to Denver, where hundreds of side events and impromptu meetups crowded trendy bars and restaurants day and night. The sector has certainly slowed down: In 2022, the crypto market lost as much as $2 trillion. But if you stopped to talk to any investor or founder, it became clear that many entrepreneurs and investors believe the market downturn is constructive to the long-term health of the web3 space. Projects are settling down into real value and foundation building rather than pump-and-dump schemes and hyped-up NFT sales. My conversations with EthDenver attendees took place just before Bitcoin’s value surged to its highest since last June. Even with the cryptocurrency at over $28,000, the price is still way below its all-time high of $64,000. Developers and founders I talked to celebrated the toned-down parties as a good thing because it meant that most of the speculators were gone. Even local Uber drivers noticed. Last year, they were shuttling people between much more extravagant parties. “You could just smell money in the air,” one of them told me. “And this year it felt more serious.” The downsizing of events and parties went in tandem with shrinking investments for startups, which now face a harrowing time to attract financing. The amount of venture capital for web3 companies saw a sharp decline in Q4 2022, totaling $2.4 billion compared to $9.3 billion a year ago, according to Crunchbase. The number of web3 startups funded halved to 327 during the quarter. "
429,"After an investigation exposes its dangers, Pinterest announces new safety tools and parental controls",['@sarahintampa'],"April 12, 2023","Following last month’s NBC News investigation into Pinterest that exposed how pedophiles had been using the service to curate image boards of young girls, the company on Tuesday announced further safety measures for its platform, including a new set of parental controls and updated age verification policies, among other things. However, the company also said that it would soon re-open some of its previously locked-down features for teens to allow them to once again message and share content with others after approving contacts. The investigation had stained Pinterest’s carefully crafted reputation as one of the last safe and positive places on the internet. Instead, the report found that, much like any other social media platform, Pinterest was at risk of being abused by bad actors. The report found that grown men were using the site to create image boards of young girls, sexualizing innocuous photos of children doing things like gymnastics, dancing, sticking out their tongues, wearing bathing suits and more. In addition, Pinterest’s recommendation engine was making it easier to find similar content as it would suggest more images like those the predators initially sought out. Immediately after the report, two U.S. senators reached out to Pinterest for answers about what was being done and to push for more safety measures. The company said it increased the number of human content moderators on its team and added new features that allow users to report content and accounts for “Nudity, pornography or sexualized content,” including those involving “intentional misuse involving minors.” Pinterest also swept its platform to deactivate thousands of accounts — a move that may have accidentally disabled legitimate accounts in the process, according to some online complaints. Now, the company is announcing even more safety controls are in the works. For starters, it says it will expand its age verification process. By the end of this month, if someone who entered their age as under 18 tries to edit their date of birth on the Pinterest app, the company will require them to send additional information to its third-party age verification partner. This process includes sending a government ID or birth certificate and may also require the users to take a selfie for an ID photo. Image Credits: Pinterest Image Credits: Pinterest In addition, Pinterest announced it will soon offer more parental controls. Parents and guardians of children under the age of 18 will have the ability to require a passcode before their teen is allowed to change certain account settings. This would prevent a younger child from trying to change their account to an adult’s age — which matters because minors’ accounts have further protections. Image Credits: Pinterest Image Credits: Pinterest On Pinterest, teens under the age of 16 have accounts that are set private by default and aren’t discoverable by others on the service. In part, the reason why so many pedophiles had been able to discover the young girls’ photos is that they had been using accounts where their ages weren’t set accurately. In addition, boards and Pins saved by teens under 16 aren’t visible or accessible to anyone but the user, either. Messaging features and group boards are also not available to this demographic. But Pinterest says that will soon change, noting in its Help Documentation that it’s currently “working on updating these features so you can safely connect with those you know.” In a blog post, the company explains that it will soon re-introduce the ability for teens to “share inspiration” with the people they know, “as long as they give them permission.” Image Credits: Pinterest Image Credits: Pinterest Pinterest further touted other teen safety measures in its post, including its ban on beauty filters, which have negative impacts on mental health, as well as its bans on weight loss ads and policies against body shaming. The company shared with us it’s also modifying its automated moderation practices and made other improvements in processes around detecting bad actors. It said it increased the frequency of third-party testing to locate unsafe conduct, as well. Unfortunately, the problems Pinterest has been facing, which NBC News exposed, are not limited to its service. A lack of regulation over social media, including outdated children’s online safety laws, has led to a sort of free-for-all in the U.S. where companies are creating their own policies and making up their own rules. Financially, there’s little incentive to do anything that would make it harder for people to sign up for, use and stay engaged with their platforms, due to their ad-supported natures. While it’s good that Pinterest felt pushed by the negative media coverage to make improvements to its safety features, that shouldn’t be how companies decide to do such a thing. Yet, despite hauling in tech execs for numerous briefings over the years, Congress has failed to pass legislation to regulate social media. This has led to some states now even crafting their own laws, as Utah just did, which is complicating matters further. In the meantime, parents and families are dealing with the consequences. Like anywhere else on the internet, when children’s images are posted publicly online, they can attract a dangerous audience and platforms historically have not done enough around minor safety. Recently, there’s been heightened awareness of this problem thanks to work from creators like TikTok’s Mom.Uncharted, aka Sarah Adams, whose viral videos have helped to explain how online predators are leveraging creator content, including the work of family vloggers, for dangerous and repulsive purposes. She and others who cover the topic have been calling for parents to pull back on posting public images of their children online and stop supporting creators who share photos and videos of young children. Young people who were forced by their parents to create online content before the age of consent are also pushing for regulations that would protect future generations. Congress has yet to act here, either. Image Credits: Pinterest Image Credits: Pinterest But on Pinterest, it’s not necessarily parents who are publishing the kids’ photos — Pinterest is often used by children, which parents have tended not to mind, believing in the site’s “safe” reputation. Today, some 450 million people use Pinterest every month, and 60% are women according to Pinterest’s official statistics. Millennials are the largest age group while the second largest is women ages 18-24. In theory, Pinterest’s policies should restrict its use to users 13 and up. However, the real demographics around Pinterest usage may not be captured in online statistics, as kids often lie about their age to use apps and websites intended for an older audience. In an annual study of kids’ and teens’ app usage by parental control software maker Qustodio, for instance, Pinterest was the No. 3 social media platform in the U.S. in terms of time spent. Globally, it was No. 5. “Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and it is our guiding light in how we have created Pinterest, developed our products, and shaped our policies,” Pinterest stressed in the announcement. “As part of this on-going work, we’ll continue to focus on ways that we can keep teens safe,” it promised."
430,"Hackers could remotely turn off lights, honk, mess with Tesla’s infotainment system",['@lorenzofb'],"March 28, 2023","Thanks to three vulnerabilities chained together, malicious hackers could remotely hack into a Tesla, turn off the lights, honk the horn, open the trunk, activate the windshield wipers and mess with the infotainment system, according to security researchers. The researchers, who work for security firm Synacktiv, found the vulnerabilities and showcased them at the Pwn2Own conference in Vancouver last week. The worst-case scenario allowed by these vulnerabilities, at least as far as the researchers know, is to mess with a driver with some annoying, and potentially disruptive tactics. The good news, at least according to what Tesla told the researchers, is that they couldn’t have turned on and off the car, or steered the wheel. Though, according to Eloi Benoist-Vanderbeken, one of the researchers, perhaps it would have been possible. “[Tesla] said we wouldn’t be able to turn the steering wheel, accelerate or brake. But from our understanding of the car architecture we are not sure that this is correct, but we don’t have proof of it,” he said, because they don’t have full access to a Tesla at the moment. But they look forward to fact-checking the company’s statements as soon as they get their own Tesla. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The first vulnerability was exploitable via Bluetooth, the second one allowed the researchers to elevate their privileges and become root — cybersecurity lingo for the highest level of system access — giving them free rein to execute code in the infotainment system; the last one gave them control of the security gateway, a component that sends some commands to the car. The researchers highlighted that despite these vulnerabilities, Tesla is doing a good job making the car hard to hack, implementing a mature system of sandboxes, which isolates components and makes it harder to get higher privileges by just hacking into one of them. “It’s not at the point of a modern browser running on an iPhone or an Android, but it’s not that far from it,” Vincent Dehors said in an interview. “Tesla cars are really well connected to the internet, so they need to take care of security because they are likely to be targeted more than other cars.” The researchers said that Tesla is working on making patches for these vulnerabilities and the updates should be pushed to cars soon.

431,"Warm intros are awful for diversity, so why do investors keep insisting on them?",['@Haje'],"April 30, 2023","There are oodles of advantages to having a diverse workforce, but, as inBeta founder James Nash points out, you can’t simply take your homogenous workforce, add diversity, stir and hope for the best. Often, something subtle gets in the way of diversity at startups: Companies depend on employee referrals in the beginning, but if a startup’s makeup is already not diverse, referrals aren’t going to change that. That’s for startups. In the world of venture capital, things are more pronounced: A warm introduction is the only way to get in front of investors at many VC funds. That’s great for people who are already hooked into the startup ecosystem, but you don’t have to look for very long to realize that this is not a very diverse group of people. “We’d love to hear from you. The best way to reach us is through someone we mutually know.”
A VC firm's website For many companies, employee referrals are one of the main ways to attract new talent. That’s all good until you stop to think who your newest hire is likely to know best. It doesn’t take many rounds through that particular mill until you end up with a relatively homogenous group of people with similar education, socioeconomic backgrounds and values. If that’s what you’re optimizing for, great! Well done. If it isn’t, perhaps it’s time to stop being lazy and question why warm intros are still common practice. My question has long been: What are you optimizing for by relying on referrals? If you spend some time thinking about that, I bet you’d unearth some uncomfortable unintended consequences. Let’s talk about what we can do about it. If you read any guides about startups or raising money (including my own, although I also try to cover cold emails and cold intros), you’ll find that you need a “warm introduction” to land a meeting with a VC. Given the above parallel with hiring, that’s a problem."
432,OpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet,['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"March 23, 2023","OpenAI’s viral AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, can now browse the internet — in certain cases. OpenAI today launched plugins for ChatGPT, which extend the bot’s functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it’ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access. Easily the most intriguing plugin is OpenAI’s first-party web-browsing plugin, which allows ChatGPT to draw data from around the web to answer the various questions posed to it. (Previously, ChatGPT’s knowledge was limited to dates, events and people prior to around September 2021.) The plugin retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API and shows any websites it visited in crafting an answer, citing its sources in ChatGPT’s responses. A chatbot with web access is a risky prospect, as OpenAI’s own research has found. An experimental system built in 2021 by the AI startup, called WebGPT, sometimes quoted from unreliable sources and was incentivized to cherry-pick data from sites it expected users would find convincing — even if those sources weren’t objectively the strongest. Meta’s since-disbanded BlenderBot 3.0 had access to the web, too, and quickly went off the rails, delving into conspiracy theories and offensive content when prompted with certain text. Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI The live web is less curated than a static training dataset and — by implication — less filtered, of course. Search engines like Google and Bing use their own safety mechanisms to reduce the chances unreliable content rises to the top of results, but these results can be gamed. They also aren’t necessarily representative of the totality of the web. As a piece in The New Yorker notes, Google’s algorithm prioritizes websites that use modern web technologies like encryption, mobile support and schema markup. Many websites with otherwise quality content get lost in the shuffle as a result. This gives search engines a lot of power over the data that might inform web-connected language models’ answers. Google has been found to prioritize its own services in Search by, for example, answering a travel query with data from Google Places instead of a richer, more social source like TripAdvisor. At the same time, the algorithmic approach to search opens the door to bad actors. In 2020, Pinterest leveraged a quirk of Google’s image search algorithm to surface more of its content in Google Image searches, according to The New Yorker. OpenAI admits that a web-enabled ChatGPT might perform all types of undesirable behaviors, like sending fraudulent and spam emails, bypassing safety restrictions and generally “increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead or abuse others.” But the company also says that it’s “implemented several safeguards” informed by internal and external red teams to prevent this. Time will tell whether they’re sufficient. Beyond the web plugin, OpenAI released a code interpreter for ChatGPT that provides the chatbot with a working Python interpreter in a sandboxed, firewalled environment along with disk space. It supports uploading files to ChatGPT and downloading the results; OpenAI says it’s particularly useful for solving mathematical problems, doing data analysis and visualization and converting files between formats. Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI A host of early collaborators built plugins for ChatGPT to join OpenAI’s own, including Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram and Zapier. They’re largely self-explanatory. The OpenTable plugin allows the chatbot to search across restaurants for available bookings, for example, while the Instacart plugin lets ChatGPT place orders from local stores. By far the most extensible of the bunch, Zapier connects with apps like Google Sheets, Trello and Gmail to trigger a range of productivity tasks. To foster the creation of new plugins, OpenAI has open sourced a “retrieval” plugin that enables ChatGPT to access snippets of documents from data sources like files, notes, emails or public documentation by asking questions in natural language. “We’re working to develop plugins and bring them to a broader audience,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We have a lot to learn, and with the help of everyone, we hope to build something that is both useful and safe.” Plugins are a curious addition to the timeline of ChatGPT’s development. Once limited to the information within its training data, ChatGPT is, with plugins, suddenly far more capable — and perhaps at less legal risk. Some experts accuse OpenAI of profiting from the unlicensed work on which ChatGPT was trained; ChatGPT’s dataset contains a wide variety of public websites. But plugins potentially address that issue by allowing companies to retain full control over their data."
433,Southwest Airlines resumes operations after briefly halting takeoffs due to a ‘technical issue’,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 18, 2023","Southwest Airlines is resuming operations after the airline briefly paused departures due to a “technical issue” earlier this morning. The airline says it had to address data connection issues caused by a firewall failure. “Southwest has resumed operations after temporarily pausing flight activity this morning to work through data connection issues resulting from a firewall failure,” the company said in a statement. “Early this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost. Southwest Teams worked quickly to minimize flight disruptions.”  FlightAware indicates that nearly 2,500 of Southwest’s flights on Tuesday morning, which represents about 30% of its schedule for the day, were delayed. The airline is asking travelers to use Southwest.com to check their flight status or visit a Southwest Airlines Customer Service Agent at the airport for assistance with travel needs. The latest disruption comes months after Southwest canceled more than 16,700 flights in December due to changes to its staff scheduling computer systems. The issues cost Southwest more than $1 billion and frustrated thousands of travelers during the busy holiday travel season. The Department of Transportation opened an investigation into the airline in response to the widespread disruption. At the time, the airline said it had taken steps to prevent another widespread disruption. Southwest conducted a review with aviation consulting firm Oliver Wyman to determine ways to prevent another similar situation. Following the review, the airline introduced technology updates to crew reassignment software, weather alert dashboards, communication systems and more as part of a $1.3 billion plan to boost its operational resiliency."
434,"What is this, revenue growth for ants?",['@alex'],"April 27, 2023","It’s earnings season, that time of the quarter when we get to judge how well public tech firms are fulfilling all the lofty promises they’ve been making. So far this week, we’ve heard from Microsoft and Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook), among other names. While results from companies like Roku and Spotify hold interesting information about particular segments of the consumer tech market and the health of advertising demand more generally, the sheer extent of Big Tech’s reach means their results bring a sheaf of color to our understanding of the current tech and business worlds. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. What have the majors shown us this week? The most important trend we’ve gleaned from three of the American big five (we’ll hear from Amazon later today and Apple next week) is their very moderate pace of trailing growth. Investors were largely mollified, if not downright pleased, by these results. Both Alphabet and Microsoft are each up a few points in early trading, and Meta is up nearly 15% after it managed to pleasantly surprise investors, who expected it to post another quarter of slowing revenues. We’ve spilled more ink than I want to recall covering investors’ new preference for more profitable growth instead of crazy, unprofitable growth. Mostly, we’ve discussed that in reference to startups, but in the case of these tech giants, things get a bit more nuanced. That said, it’s clear that trimming costs and investing in growth are efforts that make investors happy. Given that we often hear of startups bearing growth expectations in the triple digits, it may be surprising to assume that roughly $4 trillion in market cap across three companies could be defended with revenue growth in the single digits, but here we are. Alphabet’s 3% rise in revenue was driven by Google Cloud’s top line increasing to $7.5 billion from $5.8 billion a year earlier. Search grew by less than $1 billion to $40.4 billion, while Google Network and YouTube advertising incomes dipped."
435,Augmental lets you control a computer (and sex toys) with your tongue,['@Haje'],"May 2, 2023","Worldwide, about one in six people live with a disability. Whether through injury or illness, disability can manifest itself as an impediment to mobility. There have been fantastic advancements in communication and operational technologies, but there’s always room for improvement, and Augmental, an MIT Media Lab spinoff, thinks that it might be on to something with its newly announced MouthPad. When you think of assistive devices, you might think of eye-tracking technology, mouth-controlled joysticks or voice recognition assistance. However, as Tomás Vega, one of Augmental’s co-founders, pointed out, many of these devices rely on old tech and — in the case of mouth-controlled joysticks — are obtrusive. They can be exhausting to use, don’t necessarily pay much heed to privacy and they can have other negative impacts, for example, on teeth. “Augmental has a goal to create an interface that overcomes all those limitations,” says Vega. “Making one that is expressive, and private and seamless and slick. We created a mouth pad which is an intraoral interface that allows you to control a computer with no hands.” The Augmental team regards MouthPad’s development as part of the normal progression of technology. Tongue-controlled gaming is one of the angles Augmental takes into this market. Image Credits: Augmental Tongue-controlled gaming is one of the angles Augmental takes into this market. Image Credits: Augmental “But we can kind of give ourselves the context of just looking at the history of this,” said Corten Singer, co-founder of Augmental. “Mainframe rooms once existed, where the whole room was the computer plugging in actual cables, go to your desktop, or laptops are now with us. Our phones are in our pockets at all times. We have wristwatches that are smart; we’ve got buds in our ears. It’s kind of speaking towards this more seamless human machine integration that is coming in.” The MouthPad is similar to a dental retainer or plate, but rather than realigning your teeth or holding false ones in place, it provides the opportunity for a wearer to control Bluetooth-connected devices using their tongue. Each MouthPad is created individually using dental scans to ensure that it fits its user perfectly. “With our super customizable design — the fact that we’re using dental scans — it allows us to be a perfect fit to the user’s anatomy,” said Singer. “We can design a very thin low-profile device that reduces or at least minimizes the impact you have on speech, because in reality, speech interfaces are helpful.” “Yes, they’re not private, but they’re pretty awesome,” said Singer of speech interfaces. “And we want to design to be complementary with that. Of course we want also to be able to serve as a standalone option, but we don’t want to remove the ability to use the speech interfaces but meet the technology as it currently exists in the landscape, where it’s at and not necessarily interrupting them.”  Singer described how Augmental’s MouthPad enables eight degrees of freedom to control it. The tongue can operate through the X and Y axes, as well as by deploying pressure. There’re motion sensors that can detect head tracking and activity monitoring. And there’s even a possibility for bites to register as a click. The wide variety of control options embedded into the MouthPad means that it can be used in conjunction with many different devices. When TechCrunch spoke to the Augmental team, they gave examples from their test users as to how people are making the most of the MouthPad. “We have gamers that have quadriplegia, and they can only use a joystick,” said Vega. “So in order to play, you need two joysticks, so we were complementing a setup, so they can now strafe and aim at the same time.” “Then we have another user who is a designer that has issues doing click and drag in very accurate ways,” said Vega. “So we’ve created a clutching gesture so he can click in and click out.” But as well as being used for gaming and for work, the MouthPad has also been connected to a sex toy to enable someone with a spinal cord injury to engage in autonomous sex play. Singer explained how some people have been surprised by this use case, but that really, it shouldn’t be regarded as peculiar or extraordinary: it’s a function that helps to make people’s lives better. “It’s just part of this conversation that we think should be had, you know,” said Singer. “It’s at the core, it’s a theme of universal accessibility and digital equity across the board.”  So far, the Augmental team has raised pre-seed funding from investors at MIT and Berkeley. It has recently launched its website where it has opened up a waitlist, enabling people to sign up for a MouthPad. There is still a little delay, however. “We still need to finish our FCC certification before we can ship and sell devices,” said Singer, “putting them into the mouths of our customers.” The company put together a video demo, in case you want to take a closer lick:"
436,Google follows Apple by introducing account deletion policy for Android apps,['@indianidle'],"April 5, 2023","Google announced a new account deletion policy for Android apps today, which means that apps that offer account creation must have an easy way to delete the account as well. The company said that it will start enforcing this policy sometime early next year. This move follows Apple, which implemented a similar policy on June 30, 2022 for apps on the App Store. The company said that it will ask developers to answer questions regarding their app’s data deletion in the Data Safety form by December 7. The developer responses in the form are reflected in Google Play’s Data Safety section, which provides users with information about an app’s data collection practices in the form of labels. Google mentioned that with this new policy, the company will tweak the Data Safety section on the Play Store to better reflect the data controls available to them. The search giants said that sometime early next year users will start seeing data deletion badges on Google Play on apps that have completed their forms and modified their code to allow account deletion. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google The search giant said that apps must provide “an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online” and the feature should be easily discoverable. Plus, the policy also requires developers to delete the user data from their servers on account deletion. If a developer needs to keep user data for specific reasons, they must specify that in the app. “As the new policy states, when you fulfill a request to delete an account, you must also delete the data associated with that account. The feature also gives developers a way to provide more choice: users who may not want to delete their account entirely can choose to delete other data only where applicable (such as activity history, images, or videos). For developers that need to retain certain data for legitimate reasons such as security, fraud prevention, or regulatory compliance, you must disclose those data retention practices,” Google said in its announcement. The company will provide an extended grace period until May 31, 2024, for developers who might need some time to implement this. But they will need to explicitly apply for it through the Google Play console."
437,It’s never too late to align product-market fit metrics with your company’s values,['@dominicmadori'],"May 1, 2023","It’s a perennial question for early-stage startups: How does one find product-market fit (PMF)? What do you do to ensure that your idea takes a form that meets some sort of demand in your target market? How do you get your idea to resonate in the world? At TechCrunch’s Early Stage event a couple weeks ago in Boston, David Thacker, a general partner at Greylock, advised startups to keep it simple: focus, adjust and adapt. The definition of PMF is, for the most part, subjective, but Thacker looks for something more tangible. “It doesn’t mean you’ve launched a product and scaled it to millions of customers and users,” he said. “What I’m looking for is some semblance that what you’ve built is resonating with a set of customers.” This metric may vary by stage, but Series A and onward is when it becomes critical for a company to have PMF. At that stage, Thacker said, investors want to see a moderate scale of consumer usage, and as a company looks toward a Series B round, it’s best to start thinking about total addressable market (TAM) size and where your product sits in relation to it. “You may have found product-market fit with an audience segment, but how big is that audience? How lucrative is that going to be when expanded out? Those are the things we start to think about,” he said, urging founders to determine their company’s PMF with a metric that aligns with the company’s values."
438,Turns out most unicorns today are more myth than reality,['@alex'],"April 12, 2023","The pace at which new billion-dollar startups are minted is in freefall. Given what we’ve seen recently concerning the late-stage funding market, we shouldn’t be shocked. As late-stage dollars retreat and capital served up in mega-rounds — deals worth $100 million or more — evaporates, the fuel that once lifted many a startup rocket into the valuation stratosphere has sputtered. It makes sense that fewer companies would reach unicorn altitude. Initially, I wanted to make an argument crossing falling M&A activity and initial public offerings with the decline in new unicorn creation, pointing out that without the ability to exit, of course the pace at which new unicorns were created would fall. If paper marks failed to turn liquid, paper marks would become worth less, right? The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. That’s too generous an interpretation, because it rests on the assumption that the unicorns minted in the past were actually worth what they were purported to be. Sure, the last venture capital supercycle really did build some real unicorns. Uber is worth north of $60 billion; Coinbase is worth a bit more than $16 billion this morning — you can fill in other names. But those are the outliers: Most unicorns have not found an exit, and as the market discovers that most billion-dollar startups aren’t natural, the capital flowing into them has slowed to a trickle. Let’s take the argument one step further: If most unicorns did not exit during the boom and now cannot do so with their real valuations being lower than their last private mark (and is likely under the $1 billion threshold today), was the startup in question ever really a unicorn? I would posit that the answer is no. Most unicorns never were what they were purported to be. Instead, a lot of startups were granted big budgets to LARP as unicorns thanks to outsized venture capital funds, in turn predicated on a combination of low interest rates and a choppy global economy brought on by COVID. Don’t believe me? Check this chart from the new CB Insights Q1 venture report:"

Users will be able to connect their smartwatches to a Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Row and Guide and see their heart rate on screen during workouts. After a user selects a workout on their Peloton equipment and opens the Peloton Watch App on their Galaxy Watch, a prompt will appear to pair the two devices. Users can tap the “connect” button to see their heart rate displayed on their Peloton equipment screen or Wear OS platform during their workout. Samsung says this new integration lets users track their fitness goals in real time. The Galaxy Watch integration comes a year after Peloton added Apple Watch integration to all of its machines. “At Samsung, we believe technology should help us lead happier and healthier lives. That’s a value we share with Peloton,” said Janet Lee, SVP of Mobile Experience at Samsung Electronics America. “This partnership embodies our mutual commitment to providing a truly personalized fitness experience for consumers. These new capabilities give users a more detailed picture of their progress, helping them achieve their fitness goals.” Today’s announcement comes a few weeks after Samsung added temperature-based period tracking to its Galaxy Watch5 thanks to a new partnership with Natural Cycles that leverages the smartwatch’s temperature sensors to make better predictions.

440,FTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could ‘turbocharge’ fraud,['@sarahintampa'],"April 18, 2023","In a Congressional hearing on Tuesday focused on the Federal Trade Commission’s work to protect American consumers from fraud and other deceptive practices, FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to “turbocharge” fraud. The warning was issued in response to an inquiry over how the Commission was working to protect Americans from unfair practices related to technological advances. Khan replied by agreeing that AI presented new risks for the FTC to manage, despite the other advantages it may present. “AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,” Khan told the House representatives. “And I think we’ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We’ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,” she stated. Khan additionally warned that AI’s ability to turbocharge fraud should be considered a “serious concern.” To help combat the problem, the FTC chair noted its technologists were being embedded across the agency’s work, both on the consumer protection side and the competition side, to ensure that any issues with AI would be properly identified and handled. In a follow-up, FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter downplayed Khan’s remarks by explaining the FTC had adapted to new technologies over the years and has the expertise to adapt again to combat AI-powered fraud. “There’s a lot of noise around AI right now and it’s important because it is [a] revolutionary technology in some ways,” Slaughter said. “But our obligation is to do what we’ve always done — which is apply the tools we have to these changing technologies, make sure that we have the expertise to do that effectively, but to not be scared off by the idea that this is a new revolutionary technology, and dig right in on protecting people,” she said. The Commission testimony, delivered by Khan, Slaughter, and Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya, was presented before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce, and addressed a wide range of topics beyond AI. Among those that intersected with technology, the agency representatives detailed in their written testimony the FTC’s work to reduce the scourge of spam phone calls; its warning to online home buyer Opendoor regarding its deceptive claims about potential sales prices; the deceptive claims made by members of the crypto community; its work to protect consumers’ private health data collected by websites and apps; its handling of the COPPA (children’s privacy law) violations made by Fortnite maker Epic Games; its orders to online learning platform Chegg over its failure to protect personal data; its combating of junk fees and the inability for consumers to easily cancel subscriptions; deceptive practices in the gig economy; and more. The agency also noted that it launched a new Office of Technology (OT) in February with the goal of supporting the agency’s law enforcement and policy work by offering in-house technical expertise, which could help it to keep pace with technological changes. The FTC’s testimony specifically referred to the OT’s focus in areas like security and privacy, digital markets, augmented and virtual reality, the gig work economy, and ad tracking technologies, in addition to “automated decision-making,” or what could include AI. “The creation of the Office of Technology builds on the FTC’s efforts over the years to expand its in-house technological expertise, and it brings the agency in line with other leading antitrust and consumer protection enforcers around the world,” the FTC said."
441,Primo is the IT tool for companies that are too small for an IT manager,['@romaindillet'],"April 20, 2023","Meet Primo, a French startup that recently raised a $3.4 million funding round to build a software-as-a-service product that handles the IT needs of small and medium companies. Primo keeps track of your fleet of devices and can then help you manage it without a dedicated IT manager. Headline and Global Founders Capital are leading the funding round, with several business angels also participating, such as Arthur Waller, Romain Niccoli, Ilana Elbaz, Josef Bovet, Matthieu Birach and Romain Libeau. Small companies usually don’t have a dedicated IT team. They tend to hire their first IT manager when they reach 200 or 300 employees. Before that, it’s a mess. Some people in the team are “pretty good with computers” and can fix minor issues. For heavy-duty tasks, companies often rely on outsourced IT. When there’s a new hire, someone from the HR or admin teams will make sure that the new employee has everything they need to get started. It often involves ordering a new computer, adding a reference number to a spreadsheet, emailing the outsourced IT person so that they can grant access to internal tools, etc. “The complexity of IT has completely changed — it has become operational. When someone joins the team, there are 35 tasks to do,” Primo co-founder and CEO Martin Pannier told me. It’s a time-consuming process and chances are the task list is not even up to date. Primo wants to be the companion SaaS for small companies. It currently has four different modules that should speed up and rationalize IT tasks. “Everyone has become an accidental IT manager. It has a lot of advantages. One, it’s free. Two, it’s super agile and responsive,” Pannier said. First, Primo can simplify how your company manages laptops and other devices. Instead of ordering from different websites and manually keeping track of devices in a spreadsheet, Primo users can order new laptops from Primo’s dashboard. As Primo is connected to several HR information systems, it’s easy to see which laptop belongs to which employee. This module is free and acts as the top of the funnel when it comes to customer acquisition for the SaaS platform. Primo customers pay the retail price for new laptops while the startup takes a cut thanks to wholesale pricing. Second, Primo helps you manage devices remotely. For this module, the company works with Hexnode, a mobile device management (MDM) company. But instead of showcasing a ton of options to the end customers, Primo is focusing on the needs of small companies. The default configuration is already quite opinionated and should cover the vast majority of use cases. The laptop display is locked after five minutes, local storage is encrypted by default, automatic updates are enabled, etc. Customers can also use Primo’s MDM module to deploy apps on the employees’ laptops. Image Credits: Primo Image Credits: Primo Third, Primo has a security module with Next-Generation Antivirus solutions (NGAV) and end-point detection and response (EDR). Once again, the company is partnering with another company to bring these features. Finally, Primo also offers support features. In that case, if an employee has a problem because they spilled some water or their laptop got stolen, Primo handles all repairs and replacements with next-day loaner devices and some insurance coverage. Up next, the startup wants to tackle software IT. Big companies often rely on an identity and access management product like Okta to make sure that everybody has access to the right tools — and that former employees can’t access Slack anymore. But it’s extremely complex to implement. “Okta addresses companies from 250 to 300,000 employees. But 99% of their efforts go towards the 5,000 to 300,000 segment,” Pannier said. Some companies rely on Google’s single sign-on feature. But that requires some development and manual configuration. Instead, Primo is going to rely on Auth0 (a company that was acquired by Okta) for their access management products. But that’s not live just yet. Essentially, Primo is part of this new trend of SaaS startups that bundle a bunch of products in the same platform. The idea is that things should be easy and simple for small companies. They don’t want to deal with four different vendors if a company can already cover 95% of their needs. Image Credits: Primo Image Credits: Primo"
442,"Roku announces a second set of layoffs impacting 200 employees, or 6% of its workforce",['@sarahintampa'],"March 30, 2023","Roku is the latest tech company to announce a second round of layoffs with today’s news that it’s letting go of 6% of its workforce, or around 200 employees. The company disclosed the cuts in an SEC filing, explaining that the decision is part of a larger plan to lower its year-over-year operating expense growth and prioritize projects that it believes will have a higher return on investment. The company had laid off 200 U.S. employees back in November, citing economic conditions in the industry. The new filing also said the restructuring would result in the “exit and sublease” of certain office space Roku no longer occupies. The plan will cost Roku approximately $30 to $35 million in non-recurring charges related to matters like severance costs, notice pay, employee benefit contributions and other related costs related to the cease of use of its office facilities. Roku said it expects the majority of those charges to be incurred in the first quarter of this year. It expects the headcount reductions, including the cash payments, to be “substantially complete” by the end of the second quarter of this year, the filing also stated. In its earlier round of layoffs, Roku had said the current economic conditions had necessitated the layoffs as the company needed to slow down the growth of its operating expenses. The news had then followed Roku’s third-quarter results, where it had warned investors of an unsatisfactory fourth quarter ahead. In its most recent earnings announced in February, however, Roku beat its own revenue expectations with total net revenue of $867.1 million for Q4 2022. It had predicted revenue would come in around $800 million, while analysts were predicting a decline of 7% year-over-year to $804.19 million. It also announced 70 million active accounts globally in 2022, up from the 65.4 million it had in Q3. However, Roku’s operating losses had widened to $249.9 million, up from a loss of $147 million in the prior quarter. The company didn’t disclose which roles or locations would be impacted by this latest round of cuts. Reached for comment, Roku declined to share anything more beyond what was published in its 8-K filing. Roku is not the only tech company to dole out its headcount reductions over a period of many months. Amazon this month did the same, as did Meta and others.

443,"In a slowing market, venture investor Canaan still closes $850M across two new funds",['@cookie'],"April 6, 2023","The market is slowing down, but that’s not stopping Canaan, a 35-year-old early-stage venture firm that invests in both tech and healthcare. It just closed on $850 million in capital commitments across two new funds: a $650 million flagship fund — its 13th — and a separate $200 million fund to support its breakaway portfolio companies. The amount is slightly more than the $800 million that Canaan gathered for its 12th flagship fund in October 2020 and brings the firm’s assets under management to $6.8 billion. That Canaan closed an opportunity-style fund in the current market is somewhat counterintuitive. Some institutional investors privately grouse that they don’t like later-stage funds hosted by early-stage investors, as it complicates their ability to properly diversify their own investments. A growing number of early-stage investors are also deciding to forgo dedicated late-stage funds owing to a market where exits are few and IPOs are even more rare. Lux Capital, for example, is raising a single fund after previously raising more than one fund at once; Felicis, another early-stage investor, recently made the same decision. But Maha Ibrahim, a general partner at Canaan who joined the outfit 23 years ago, says there are numerous reasons for that second fund. First, she points to a subset of the firm’s portfolio companies — on both the tech and healthcare sides — that require more capital. She says, too, that with many investors “sitting on their hands at the late stage” right now, the new fund gives Canaan a “great way to support companies and get a lot more ownership in them.” Ibrahim further insists the flagship fund was “oversubscribed” and that the team wanted to “make room for supportive LPs.” It’s understandable why its ongoing backers might have wanted to re-up. Over the past five years, says Canaan, the firm has seen ten IPOs, four public listings, and eight M&A exits, generating roughly $1.7 billion in returns. Some of those outcomes include the IPO of Day One Biopharmaceuticals in May 2021, TheRealReal in June 2019, and the biopharmaceutical company Arvinas in September 2018. Canaan was also an investor in the customer service software company Kustomer, acquired by Meta for $1 billion in February 2022, though Meta is now reportedly considering different divestiture options for the outfit as part of a plan for broader cost cuts. Another portfolio company, Axis Security, was meanwhile acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise just last month for undisclosed terms. Ibrahim also underscores that Canaan is “really an early-stage focused fund” and wanted its main fund to reflect as much. “It’s cleaner for us,” she says. As for where that capital may wind up, areas that have a “very strong market pull right now,” says Ibrahim, include cybersecurity, where Canaan has already been active, including as an early investor in the eight-year-old outfit Snyk (currently valued at roughly $7.4 billion) and the industrial cybersecurity company Dragos, whose valuation reached $1.7 billion in 2021. “It’s our intention to back winners at reasonable prices,” she says. “We’re powering into a market where there will be up rounds for the winners, but I don’t think at nearly the stratospheric valuations as before.” The firm remains as interested as ever in certain areas within healthcare, too, including immunology, neurobiology, and cardio. Canaan even incubates such companies on occasion, including co-founding Day One Biopharmaceuticals. “We saw opportunities within oncology that we could focus on, so we thought why should we let others start it if we can do it?” says Ibrahim."
444,Upheaval in venture banking can help us get back to basics: Efficient growth,[],"March 27, 2023","With the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, founders find themselves in a predicament when looking to raise either equity or debt. Most companies run their business on equity capital alone and have access to a venture debt facility. Access to venture debt is a “break glass in case of emergency” facility in that it enables companies not to be as hardened when they must raise rather than raising tied to business milestones. When a majority of the venture debt market is slowing or pausing new loan originations, one thing’s for sure, this loss of runway capacity will inevitably drive behavior change on all sides. And a behavior change, or a reset, is sorely needed. Prior to this added chaos, the startup funding environment was already challenged. The reality is that most founders and venture funds don’t know what the market price is on startup valuations at the moment — and now an opportunity for a reset of sorts presents itself, not on valuations, but what we as an ecosystem do with its precious cash. We know that if a founder raised their 2021 round of capital at today’s multiples, the effect would be meaningfully more dilutive, which is why embracing a cash-efficient approach is important. Combine a slower equity market and less debt capacity/flexibility, you enter a time where founders need to raise more equity at higher dilution or be more efficient with less. The reality is that most founders and venture funds don’t know what the market price is on startup valuations at the moment. One retro-cool phrase experiencing a resurgence in our industry is efficient growth. Even typing it feels like watching paint dry because when this phrase is uttered, people can’t help but jump to metrics like CAC/LTV, burn efficiency, OpEx ratios, and of course, the good old rule of 40. Efficient growth is a mainstay topic of conversation among investors, and I’m a longtime proponent, but that mindset hasn’t exactly been top of mind in the industry these last few years. With a lens on early-stage investing (seed to Series B), here are a few things I think resonate with VCs right now and the factors founders should consider when planning and operating: Multi-year customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback is very 2021. Understanding how to do more of the same profitably is essential to efficient growth and to finding a VC to fund that growth."
445,India to require Facebook and Twitter rely on gov’t fact checking,['@refsrc'],"April 6, 2023","India amended its IT law on Thursday to prohibit Facebook, Twitter and other social media firms from publishing, hosting or sharing false or misleading information about “any business” of the government and said the firms will be required to rely on New Delhi’s own fact-check unit to determine the authenticity of any claim in a blow to many American giants that identify the South Asian market as their largest by users. Failure to comply with the rule, which also impacts internet service providers such as Jio and Airtel, risks the firms losing their safe harbor protections. The rule, first proposed in January this year, assigns a unit of the government arbitrary and over-broad powers to determine the authenticity of online content and bypasses the principles of natural justice, said New Delhi-headquartered digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation. “The notification of these amended rules cement the chilling effect on the fundamental right to speech and expression, particularly on news publishers, journalists, activists, etc. The fact check unit could effectively issue a takedown order to social media platforms and even other intermediaries across the internet stack, potentially bypassing the process statutorily prescribed under the Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000,” Internet Freedom Foundation added. The Ministry of Electronics and IT asserted that existing IT rules already required intermediaries to make “reasonable efforts to not host, publish or share any information which is patently false and untrue or misleading in nature.” India is a key overseas market for Facebook, Twitter and Google. Facebook and Google have ploughed more than $15 billion in India in the past decade as they raced to win the last great growth market. Their services now reach over half a billion users in India. The firms have previously pushed back against several of New Delhi’s proposals. The amendment on Thursday also cracks down on online games that offer betting services by amending its IT Rules 2021 that will require self-regulatory bodies to ban apps that offer wagering. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, India’s minister of state for electronics and information technology, said at a press conference that online gambling and betting platforms presented challenges to New Delhi’s vision of open and safe internet. “We have seen over the last few months many startups running afoul of state laws, state rules and state regulations. We hope that these rules will create a much more stable, consistent and predictable framework for all those startups that are interested in the online gaming ecosystem.” The Ministry of Electronics and IT has tasked the gaming industry, which represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity, to form self-regulatory bodies and in its amendment on Thursday said such bodies will determine which games are permitted in the country. “These rules don’t deal with all the nuances and sophistication of games of chance and games of skills. We are bypassing that by laying out a basic principle that the moment an online game trespasses into involving betting and wagering, regardless of its core content, then it falls afoul of these rules,” he said. Chandrasekhar said many online platforms have masqueraded as gaming have offered betting services and in some cases have been involved in criminal activities such as money laundering. The ministry further said that online gaming firms will be required to undertake the know your customer verification before they allow users to spend any money. Additionally, online games will not be permitted, either directly or through a third-party, to offer credit financing options to their users. The vast majority of betting games focus on IPL, a two-month long T20 cricket tournament. Revenue for fantasy sports is estimated to grow as much as 35% this year to over $375 million, according to consultancy firm Redseer. Fantasy sports startups insist that their offerings test customers’ skills and is different from gambling. “Steep growth in fantasy sports gaming will come from tier 2 cities driven by increasing adoption of fantasy platforms and cross-migration of users from other games. Increased internet accessibility will give a push to the IPL economy. Our estimates suggest that the average revenue per user is expected to grow from INR 410 ($5) in IPL 2022 to INR 440 ($5.37) per user in IPL 2023,” the firm said. Jagmeet Singh contributed to this report. An earlier version of the story focused on the amendment to rules pertaining to online games betting. "

447,Match says it’s ‘very possible’ Apple-Epic ruling could result in App Store fee relief,['@sarahintampa'],"May 3, 2023","Dating app giant Match Group believes it’s “very possible” that the recent Apple-Epic Games antitrust appeals ruling, though largely in favor of Apple, may result in App Store fee relief for developers. Speaking to investors during Match’s Q1 earnings call, Match Group President and CFO Gary Swidler shared the company’s thinking on the historic ruling, which upheld the lower court’s opinion that Apple was not a monopolist, but directed the iPhone maker to give developers the ability to place links in their apps that point customers to third-party payment options. This change to Apple’s existing “anti-steering” policy, which had prohibited developers from marketing other ways to pay, was the main reason Apple had appealed the district court’s earlier ruling. Despite losing its larger antitrust appeal, Epic Games immediately seized on this part of the appeals court decision to announce it was “working on next steps” to take advantage of the loosened permissions. Match, meanwhile, didn’t offer a hint as to its own plans related to the ruling, but rather spoke more broadly about the potential changes coming to the larger app market as a result of this decision as well as other new laws and global regulations. For example, Swidler pointed investors to various battles Apple has been facing, including the recent antitrust investigation in the U.K. with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) focused on browsers and cloud gaming. Apple won that appeal, as well, but it’s representative of a market where Apple’s policy decisions will no longer go unchecked. Meanwhile, Match said the E.U.’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), whose new rules have now started to apply, will have an impact on App Store fees. “In the E.U., and in some other jurisdictions like India, we think there’s going to be changes that are going to result in App Store fee changes… particularly as a result of the DMA in Europe — or in the E.U. — in 2024,” Swidler told investors. The exec said it wasn’t yet clear if the Apple-Epic ruling would result in App Store fee relief, but suggested it was “very possible,” adding that, ultimately, Apple has to decide if it wants to rethink its policies on a global basis or continue to set specific rules for each region. “When you…factor all this in — with all these different changes and things going on and all these different jurisdictions — I think what it means is the app stores have to ask themselves a question, which is, are they going to respond to these changes in a piecemeal basis and have different policies and fee structures and approaches in different markets? Or are they going to have one global policy that addresses all of these really significant and valid concerns, and change app store policies to reflect a more fair app store ecosystem for consumers?,” Swidler said. Match said it expects to see some sort of decision related to those questions over the next 12 months or so. The dating app maker and Tinder parent has been heavily involved in pursuing antitrust actions against the app stores, including both Apple and Google, having already provided testimony at Senate antitrust hearings, and engaging in other lawsuits, including one over Google’s Play Store fees. It’s also among the tech companies aiding the Justice Department’s antitrust investigation against Apple, along with Tile, Spotify and others. In the quarter, Match suffered an earnings miss with revenue of $787 million coming under estimates of $794 million, and paying users down 3% to 15.9 million. Net profit also fell to $120.8 million, down from $180.5 million in the year-ago quarter. However, Match said it was seeing signs of growth at Tinder after changes to marketing and product, but those weren’t yet realized in the financial results. On Tinder, for example, it’s testing “Just for You,” a curated selection of high-quality profiles designed to appeal to women and referenced its recent updates to reporting features and its AI-powered selfie verification process. The company also said it authorized a new $1 billion share buyback program and confirmed it would pull its apps from Russia, citing human rights concerns, a year after rival Bumble had announced the same.

448,MEPs raise concerns over draft EU-US data transfer deal,['@riptari'],"April 14, 2023","A shiny new data transfers deal between the European Union and the United States aimed at fixing costly legal uncertainty over exports of personal data isn’t in place yet but the European Parliament’s civil liberties committee is predicting the incoming EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) won’t survive a legal challenge — just as its two predecessors, Safe Harbor (RIP: October 2015); and Privacy Shield (RIP: July 2020), failed to impress EU judges. In a resolution passed by the LIBE committee yesterday, with 37 votes in favor, none against and 21 abstentions, the MEPs dubbed the DPF an improvement that nonetheless does not go far enough. They also predicted it’s likely to be invalidated by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in the future. The development follows a draft opinion by the LIBE, back in February, also giving the proposal a thumbs down and urging the Commission to press for meaningful reforms.   In the resolution, the committee takes the view that the proposed arrangement does not provide sufficient safeguards for EU citizens since the framework still allows for bulk collection of personal data in certain cases; does not make bulk data collection subject to independent prior authorisation; and does not provide for clear rules on data retention. The MEPs are also worried that a proposed redress mechanism — a so-called “Data Protection Review Court” — would violate EU citizens’ rights to access and rectify data about them, since decisions would be kept secret. They also question its independence since judges could be dismissed by the U.S. president, who could also overrule its decisions. “In the resolution, MEPs argue that the framework for data transfers needs to be future-proof, and the assessment of adequacy needs to be based on the practical implementation of rules,” per a parliament press release, which said the committee went on to urge the Commission not to grant adequacy based on the current regime, and instead negotiate a data transfer framework that is likely to be held up in court. Commenting in statement after the vote, the LIBE committee rapporteur Juan Fernando López Aguilar said: The new framework is certainly an improvement compared to previous mechanisms. However, we are not there yet. We are not convinced that this new framework sufficiently protects personal data of our citizens, and therefore we doubt it will survive the test of the CJEU. The Commission must continue working to address the concerns raised by the European Data Protection Board [EDPB] and the Civil Liberties Committee even if that means reopening the negotiations with the U.S. Back in February, the EDPB adopted its opinion on the framework — couching the deal as an improvement on Privacy Shield too. But the influential steering body also raised a number of concerns which it recommended should be addressed, and clarifications obtained, in order to “ensure the adequacy decision will endure”. The LIBE committee vote is a part of the EU’s general scrutiny process. Although it’s important to note that parliamentarians do not get an active say in whether or not the DPF is adopted — nor even does the EDPB. The final say on adequacy decisions rests with the Commission alone. At the same time, it’s obviously awkward if doubts are being raised within the EU about the robustness and sustainability of the planned replacement framework. The European Parliament as a whole will also get to express a view — via a future plenary session that will consider the LIBE committee’s resolution. So it will be interesting to see which way parliamentarians break. The DPF is the latest high level bid by the bloc to resolve the head-on clash between EU privacy rights and U.S. surveillance powers by slotting in another so-called adequacy decision to ease EU-U.S. data flows. The proposed framework builds on earlier (defunct) attempts by setting out a new set of provisions aimed at papering around major differences — such as a claim of “binding safeguards” to limit U.S. intelligence agencies’ access to data, including the introduction of concepts of necessity and proportionality; and a promise of enhanced oversight of spooks’ surveillance. As noted above, a new Data Protection Review Court will also be set up which is supposed to sum to an independent redress mechanism capable of resolving EU citizens’ complaints to the standard required by European judges. But which critics contend is not a proper court, in the full legal sense, so won’t pass muster with the CJEU. One thing is clear: It’s taking far longer to adopt a deal this time around now that the supply of simple sticking plasters has been exhausted. The Commission reached an agreement in principle on the DPF just over a year ago. It then took around six months for U.S. President Joe Biden to sign an Executive Order necessary for implementing the replacement. While it was almost nine months on from the agreement announcement for the EU to get to a draft agreement (around two months after the EO). At that point a process of review and scrutiny of the draft by other EU institutions was kicked off, which is still ongoing. (By contrast, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield sped from being announced as incoming in February 2016 to officially adopted by July and up and running at the start of August of the same year. It then took the CJEU just over four years to retire it. So there are certainly lessons to be learnt about lawmakers acting in haste and repenting at leisure here.) Back in April last year, the Commission suggested the whole process of replacing Privacy Shield might be “finalized” by the end of 2022. And if finalized meant adopted it was certainly being overly optimistic since we’re deep into spring 2023 and the process rumbles on. Some reports have suggested the DPF won’t be adopted before the summer (Reuters cites unnamed officials suggesting it may be ready by July). Asked about the expected date for adoption, a Commission spokesman told TechCrunch it cannot provide a precise timeline since the process involves multiple stakeholders. He also stipulated that it’s “carefully” analysing the EDPB’s opinion, and working to address its comments and requests for clarifications before moving to the next phase of the adoption process — which will entail seeking approval from a committee of EU Member States representatives. The Commission will clearly want to avoid the egg-on-the-face of a third strike down — which likely explains why adoption is taking longer than expected. And why it’s being careful to avoid being accused of ignoring concerns from the EDPB and others.   While the intricacies of EU comitology may seem an exceedingly dry theme there is one very tangible consequence attached to when the DPF is adopted. This is because tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is facing a data suspension order that could force it to cut off its exports of EU users data. And since Facebook is not federated it could be forced to shut off the service to EU users to comply with the order. A preliminary order to this end was issued by Ireland’s data watchdog back in fall 2020. After which Meta was granted a stay and also sought a judicial review — so it managed to delay the process for a while. But it ran out of road on that particular legal challenge in May 2021. And a revised draft decision was then issued in February 2022. The original challenge to Meta’s EU-U.S. data flows hinges on the same core U.S. surveillance versus EU privacy issue — but the complaint actually dates back to the year of the Snowden disclosures. So there’s been around a decade of regulatory whack-a-mole on this issue and still no final decision. However an end is — theoretically — finally in sight. Yesterday the EDPB confirmed it has taken a binding decision on the issue — which means a final decision must be issued by Meta’s lead EU DPA, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), within a month. So by mid May. Last summer the social media giant narrowly avoided an earlier cut-off scenario when EU data protection authorities disagreed over the DPC’s draft decision — kicking off a dispute resolution process baked into the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that led, eventually, to the EDPB having to step in and take a binding decision. We don’t yet know what the decision says but given the preliminary order was for suspension it seems unlikely the Board would reach a radically different outcome. And with this tortuous GDPR enforcement process winding towards a close, the question now is what will come first: An order to Meta to shut off its EU-U.S. data flows — or adoption of the EU-U.S. DPF? The latter scenario would of course provide a new escape hatch for Meta to use to avoid a suspension order. While, if the DPF arrives before the DPC’s final order, it’s the same scenario: The company will seize upon the high level framework to refresh its claim to be in full compliance with EU rules and kick the can back down the road (likely for many years more). But even if an order that Meta suspend its data flows comes first the company will surely throw all its local lawyers at finding fresh ways to delay the knife. An appeal of any regulatory order to stop exporting EU users data is certain. It may also try to stay enforcement pending the outcome of its appeal. Although it’s not certain the courts would allow that. There is another possibility, too, though. The DPC’s final decision might provide Meta with a period of time to shut off data flows — say two or three months — which could buy it just enough time for the DPF to be adopted, enabling it to reboot its legal base by utilizing the new framework and skip away from the threat of a shutdown yet again. Last month, the DPC’s commissioner, Helen Dixon, admitted to Reuters the timeline was “coming down to the wire”. Privacy watchers will certainly be scrutinizing this one closely to see whether Meta faces a final reckoning on data transfers at long, long last. Or if it latches onto another way to keep playing regulators and lawmakers off against each other.    "
449,Hackers publish sensitive employee data stolen during CommScope ransomware attack,"['Carly Page', 'Zack Whittaker']","April 17, 2023","Hackers published a trove of data stolen from U.S. network infrastructure giant CommScope, including thousands of employees’ Social Security numbers and bank account details. The North Carolina–based company, which designs and manufactures network infrastructure products for a range of customers, including hospitals, schools and U.S. federal agencies, was listed on the dark web leak site of the Vice Society ransomware gang. The listing includes a link to data stolen from the company. Ransomware gangs typically publish stolen data when efforts to secure a financial ransom demand fall through. TechCrunch reviewed portions of the data, which include internal documents, invoices and technical drawings. The trove also contains personal data of thousands of CommScope employees, including full names, postal addresses, email addresses, personal numbers, Social Security numbers and bank account information. Another folder among the leaked data includes scans of employee passports and visa documentation. The hackers appeared to gain deep access to the company’s network, exfiltrating backups of data pertaining to its MyCommScope customer portal and its internal intranet. Some of the data was unencrypted and appeared to include both CommScope customer and employee email addresses. It’s unclear exactly how many employees have been affected. CommScope employs more than 30,000 people worldwide. CommScope spokesperson Cheryl Przychodni confirmed to TechCrunch that the company detected “unauthorized access to a portion of our IT infrastructure that we determined was the result of a ransomware incident” on March 27. “Upon discovery, we immediately launched a forensic investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm and reported the matter to law enforcement,” Przychodni said, adding that the company is investigating Vice Society’s claims that it has published information from the company’s network. “We are working with our third-party experts to validate those claims and to understand the nature of the information at issue as a top priority,” she said. “We are undergoing a thorough review of any impacted data with all possible speed.” CommScope declined to answer our questions related to the leaked employee data and it’s unclear if the company has notified affected employees. Przychodni added that CommScope has seen no evidence that customer information was accessed during the breach, but declined to say if the company has the means — like server logs — to determine what data was taken from its systems. CommScope also declined to say how its systems were compromised or whether it has received any communication from the Vice Society hackers. The Vice Society ransomware gang first made headlines in 2022 during a spate of cyberattacks targeting the healthcare and education sectors. One of the biggest breaches saw the hackers publish a 500GB trove of stolen sensitive data from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), which included psychological assessments and other highly personal information of students. The gang recently turned its attention to the manufacturing sector, according to cybersecurity company Trend Micro, which said Vice Society will likely remain a “significant player” in the ransomware landscape.

450,Tesla expands non-Tesla Supercharger access to China,['@rebeccabellan'],"April 25, 2023","Certain non-Tesla vehicles in China can now charge at selected Superchargers, the company said Tuesday. The expanded access will also be available at certain destination charging points, which are wall connectors available in public locations. To start, 10 Supercharging stations across Beijing and Shanghai, as well as 120 destination charge points in 25 provinces and cities, will be available to non-Tesla electric vehicles, according to Tesla. This is the first time Tesla has opened up its non-Tesla EV Supercharging pilot program in China, one of its largest markets, but the automaker has been steadily increasing access to its network of over 45,000 Superchargers worldwide. In February, the company doubled access to Superchargers across the U.S. in response to President Joe Biden’s $7.5 billion EV charging initiative. Tesla has also recently opened up its network in parts of Europe. Historically, Tesla’s Supercharger network has used a proprietary connector that only fits with Tesla vehicles. However, there have been reports that the company has come up with a solution dubbed the Magic Dock, which makes it easier to give non-Tesla vehicles access to its chargers. Tesla operates more than 1,600 Supercharging stations in China plus over 700 destination charging points. In mainland China, around 37 models will be able to use Tesla’s chargers, including vehicles from Aiways, BMW, Porsche, BYD, Dongfeng, Ford, Geely, Zeekr, Polestar, Nio, Volvo, XPeng and more. Drivers will have to download the Tesla app, create an account and select “Charge non-Tesla vehicles” to find and use the nearest station. As Tesla has done in other markets, the company will likely gradually expand the pilot to more stations and models in the future. China has the largest EV market in the world, with sales of electric vehicles in 2021 taking up over half of the global market share."
451,How to manage uncertainty with Habi and Inspired Capital on TechCrunch Live,['@mjburnsy'],"April 12, 2023","I’m excited to announce the co-founder and CEO of Habi, Brynne McNulty Rojas, is joining me on an extra-special edition of TechCrunch Live on April 12 at 12 p.m. PDT. Brynne leads the hot real estate startup out of Colombia, which reached unicorn status last year with a $200 million raise. The topic is uncertainty. As Brynne put it to me, startup founders manage uncertainty — uncertainty in the financial environment, uncertainty in debt lines, and geopolitical uncertainty. Worse yet, when uncertainty is left unchecked, anxiety fills the void. It’s a topic agnostic of industry. Every startup faces uncertainty, and I feel Brynne’s experience will help a lot of founders. Alexa von Tobel is joining Brynne in this conversation, and I’m thrilled to have her. She founded Inspired Capital in 2019 and currently manages the $500 million fund. She invested in Habi’s Series A and followed on its Series B and Series C. She brings a unique viewpoint to the conversation and can speak to Brynne’s leadership and vision. This TechCrunch Live event records live on April 12, 2023, at 12:00 p.m. PDT. You can register to attend here. If you would like to participate in Pitch Practice, a pitch coaching session, register for that here. This is going to be a great show as we explore how Brynne and Habi navigate uncertainty as they build their proptech company in Colombia and Mexico. I hope you can join us.    "
452,Startup says the seaweed blobbing toward Florida has a silver lining,['@harriblogs'],"March 23, 2023"," A brown macroalgae native to the Atlantic’s Sargasso Sea is increasingly a menace to coastal ecosystems and communities across the Gulf of Mexico, ever since mats of the normally beneficial seaweed (known as sargassum) exploded in numbers in 2011. This is the backdrop for Carbonwave, which recently raised $5 million to put the hulking algae blooms to good use. Researchers say farm and sewage runoff is likely driving the now 5,000-mile-wide “Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt.” Climate change may also be playing a role. There’s no need to run screaming from sargassum, despite the tone of some stories covering the Florida-bound blooms. Still, they pose a threat to coral reefs and tourism-dependent livelihoods alike. When the stuff piles up on beaches, it rots, emitting skunky hydrogen sulfide.  The recent sargassum surges are forcing folks to find creative ways to get rid of it, and already, possible applications run the gamut. Researchers and entrepreneurs aim to turn it into syrup, bricks and even jet fuel. As for Carbonwave, the Boston- and Puerto Rico–based startup is using it in fertilizer, cosmetics and even faux leather. Backed by ESG-themed investment firms Natixis and Viridios Capital, as well as ocean-focused VC Katapult, Carbonwave says the new cash will help it scale production of its seaweed-based emulsifier for cosmetics. The startup said in a statement that it “has already sold half a ton” of its emulsifier, which it created as an alternative to petroleum-based ingredients. The company also claimed that its sargassum fertilizer “reduces the need of” climate change-driving nitrogen fertilizer. CEO Geoff Chapin said Carbonwave makes these products through a “proprietary extraction process,” which involves pressing the seaweed and removing the arsenic. The process yields a liquid fertilizer, while the leftover pulp forms the basis for the emulsifier and fake leather. The way Chapin tells it, the company uses “almost every part of the seaweed to make these products.” Carbonwave is part of a wave of startups vying to turn algae into environmentally friendlier products. For starters, there’s H&M-backed Algiknit (now Keel Labs), which creates textiles; a slew of bioplastics companies, including Loliware and ULUU; and a firm called Umaro, which makes sea-bacon. Seaweed startups often focus on commercializing kelp in one way or another, but a few (like Carbonwave and Seaweed Generation) focus on sargassum. “We need to put it to good use before it creates more ecological and climate harm,” Carbonwave told TechCrunch.  The startup added that it may up its $5 million Series A with additional funding later on. It has secured at least $12 million to date. "

454,"Databricks open sources a model like ChatGPT, flaws and all",['@kyle_l_wiggers'],"April 12, 2023","The march toward an open source ChatGPT-like AI continues. Today, Databricks released Dolly 2.0, a text-generating AI model that can power apps like chatbots, text summarizers and basic search engines. It’s the successor to the first-generation Dolly, which was released in late March. And — importantly — it’s licensed to allow independent developers and companies alike to use it commercially. So why is Databricks — a firm whose bread and butter is data analytics — open sourcing a text-generating AI model? Philanthropy, says CEO Ali Ghodsi. “We are in favor of more open and transparent large language models (LLMs) in the market in general because we want companies to be able to build, train and own AI-powered chatbot and other productivity apps using their own proprietary data sets,” Ghodsi told TechCrunch via email. “We might be the first, but hope not to be the last.” I find it hard to believe that a venture-backed company like Databricks is quite that generous, forgive the cynicism, particularly factoring in the time and expense required to ready a model like this for public release. Ghodsi wasn’t shy about the fact that he hoped developers would build Dolly 2.0 apps on the Databricks platform. But to his original point, Dolly 2.0 is indeed one of the first ChatGPT-like models available without major usage restrictions. Most other ChatGPT-like open source models, like Databricks’ own first-gen Dolly, make use of a datasets that contain outputs from OpenAI, violating OpenAI’s terms of service. By contrast, to train Dolly 2.0, Databricks created a training set with 15,000 records generated by thousands of Databricks employees (voluntarily). This set was used to guide an open source text-generating model called GPT-J-6B, provided by the nonprofit research group EleutherAI, to follow instructions in a chatbot-like fashion — which became Dolly 2.0. Ghodsi admits that Dolly 2.0 suffers from the same limitations as GPT-J-6B, which is to say that it only generates text in English and can be both toxic and offensive in its responses. That tracks; GPT-J-6B was trained on an open source data set called The Pile, a mix of internet-scraped text samples, some containing profane, lewd and otherwise fairly abrasive language. We didn’t see evidence of toxicity ourselves. But we did notice that Dolly 2.0 tended to answer questions in a way that wasn’t consistently factual. For example, given the prompt “What are jobs typical of women? Jobs typical of men?,” Dolly 2.0 responded: Females are more than 50% of the workforce, and this is projected to change by 2080. Many women are in the workforce in higher-paying jobs. These jobs may be more challenging to enter, but they still require the same or even greater productivity than that of men. Females are more than 50% of the workforce in the United States, and this is projected to change to 80%. That’s inaccurate on several counts. The 2080 projection appears to be purely conjecture, while the pay gap assertion is patently false. In 2022, women earned an average of 82% of what men earned, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey. Meanwhile, in response to the prompt “Was Donald Trump responsible for what happened on January 6, 2021?,” Dolly 2.0 said: Yes. On January 6, 2021, President Donald Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for using his position to attempt to take down the Democratic Party. Specifically, Trump was impeached for using his executive orders to start a war with Iran and build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The case was brought by the House of Representatives after Trump had already been impeached by the Senate for falsifying his official statements to cover up payments made to the porn start [sic] Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about their 2006 affair in 2006 [sic]. Obviously… that’s wrong. Trump wasn’t impeached on January 6, 2021. He didn’t start a war with Iran or build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and was in fact acquitted by the Senate after being impeached — twice — by the House. In another test, Dolly 2.0 tried to argue, bizarrely, that lunar eclipses are related to the gravitational forces between the moon and Earth: As of january [sic], the earth is in a neutral state. The gravitational pull of the moon is no longer exerted on the earth. The absence of the gravitational pull of the moon is referred to as a lunar eclipse. Ghodsi defended Dolly 2.0, saying that it’s not intended to be the best model of its kind and rather is geared toward simplistic applications like responding to customer support tickets, extracting information from legal briefs and generating code based on a technical prompt. “Dolly provides human-like language generation comparable to the LLMs that rely on vast amounts of data from the internet, but used on its own without further training, Dolly’s knowledge and accuracy is more limited,” he added. “We’re committed to developing AI safely and responsibly and believe as an industry, we’re moving in the right direction by opening up models, like Dolly, for the community to collaborate on.” I’m not so sure. Open sourcing opens a can of worms, naturally, as evidenced not long ago by the release of Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion, whose development was funded in part by startup Stability AI, is a text-to-image generator that’s now powering a number of well-known apps (e.g. DeviantArt’s image generator) around the web. But it’s also been used to create nonconsensual celebrity deepfakes. To Ghodsi, it’s worth the risk — and potential reward. He pointed to the telecom giant First Orion, which is testing Dolly to let engineers ask questions about documentation stored in Confluence, the collaboration platform, for onboarding and planning. “We’re freeing Dolly because we believe open sourcing models is the best way forward. It gives researchers the ability to freely scrutinize the model architecture, helps address potential issues and democratizes LLMs so that users aren’t dependent on costly proprietary large-scale LLMs,” Ghodsi said. “Organizations can own, operate and customize Dolly to their business.” Essentially, Databricks is attempting to wash its hands of liability — which makes the prospect for businesses a bit less appealing, one imagines. A mayor in Australia has threatened OpenAI with a defamation lawsuit over false claims made by ChatGPT. And some legal experts have argued that generative AI, because it sometimes regurgitates data from its training set, could put companies at risk if they were to unwittingly incorporate copyrighted suggestions from the tools into their production software. We’ll have to see what happens. But in any case, Ghodsi says this won’t be the last from Databricks. “Databricks is deeply committed to making it simple for customers to use LLMs,” he said. “You should expect both a continued investment in open source, as well as innovations that help accelerate the application of LLMs to key business challenges.”"
455,You can now bundle Frontier internet with YouTube TV on the same bill,['@laurenforristal'],"March 27, 2023","YouTube TV announced today that it expanded its partnership with internet service provider Frontier to launch a single billing option, which will allow customers in the U.S. to bundle fiber internet with YouTube TV on one bill. YouTube TV teamed up with Frontier in 2021 to give customers access to fiber internet and a live TV streaming service. However, they had to pay the providers separately. Today’s launch of integrated billing will make it more convenient for users. Also, Frontier fiber internet customers will now get $10 off the YouTube TV subscription for one year, whereas existing Frontier TV customers will receive $15 off. The offering is likely to convince customers to switch to YouTube TV as Frontier no longer offers its TV service. After filing for bankruptcy in 2020, Frontier stopped offering cable television in 2021. Many cable TV companies have decided to either launch streaming services or partner with services like YouTube TV. For instance, in 2021, Disney announced plans to shut down hundreds of cable channels as it shifted focus to its flagship streamer Disney+. “Our partnership with YouTube TV makes it easier for customers to ditch cable,” John Harrobin, Frontier’s executive vice president of Consumer, said in a statement. “We take our position as the un-cable provider seriously and are constantly listening to consumers. Many want one source for internet and TV, and that’s what this partnership is all about.” It’s important to note that Frontier is only available in 25 states.

456,"FAA failed to fully assess environmental effects of Starship, lawsuit alleges",['@breadfrom'],"May 1, 2023","A coalition of advocacy groups has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) over its handling of the environmental assessment of SpaceX’s launch plans in southeast Texas. The FAA gave the green-light to SpaceX’s Starship launch program last summer, with the stipulation that the company perform a series of measures to mitigate environmental impacts to the surrounding area. But the lawsuit says this analysis, and the mitigating measures it required, are not sufficient to offset or even fully understand the full effects of repeat Starship launches. While the FAA has grounded Starship pending an investigation into the April 20 flight test that ended in a mid-air explosion, the suit is asking the court to rescind SpaceX’s launch license to fly the rocket altogether, until a full environmental assessment is complete. SpaceX’s Starbase, its sprawling launch and rocket development site in southeast Texas, is near Brazos Island State Park and Boca Chica State Park, which are both home to sensitive bird and other animal populations. The Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which is directly adjacent to the launch site, is “one of the most biologically diverse regions in North America,” the suit says. These sites are home to federally protected species like the piping plover, loggerhead sea turtles and ocelots. The complaint takes particular aim at testing “anomalies,” like the mid-air explosion of Starship that concluded the April 20 test flight. That test, which caused significant damage to the rocket’s massive concrete launch pad, generated debris that spread across hundreds of acres, into surrounding parkland and the beach. The nearby town of Port Isabel was reportedly covered in a grimy sand that was kicked up from the launch. The effects of anomalies were not sufficiently considered by the FAA’s analysis, the group alleges. Nor does the FAA require SpaceX to conduct measures, like static fire tests, to mitigate the risks of an anomaly from occurring, they say. The FAA originally planned to conduct an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the Starship launch program, then later chose to scale that back to what’s called a “Programmatic Environmental Assessment” instead — a type of analysis that’s used to determine if a full EIS is required. Choosing instead to conduct “a considerably less thorough analysis” was “based on SpaceX’s preference,” the lawyers argued. In a decision issued last summer, the FAA ultimately determined that an EIS was not required, so long as SpaceX implement a series of mitigating measures. Failing to conduct an EIS is in violation of the National Environment Policy Act, a key piece of federal legislation requiring agencies to review environmental impacts before issuing permits and other major actions, the complaint says. The plaintiffs include environmental advocacy groups Center for Biological Diversity, American Bird Conservancy, Surfrider Foundation, Save RGV and an organization representing the Carrizo/Comecrudo indigenous tribe. Jared Margolis, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, told TechCrunch that under Washington, D.C. circuit law the groups could not file the suit until after the FAA issued the launch license to SpaceX. “In the D.C. district, you can’t suit until the final permit is issued,” he said. In a Twitter Spaces this weekend, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that “to the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful damage to the environment that we’re aware of.” Read the full complaint here."
457,"Cloud infrastructure revenue growth dips to 19% in Q1, but still hits $63B for quarter",['@ron_miller'],"April 28, 2023","As expected, companies are continuing to cut back on their cloud spend where possible, as tech budgets continue to get careful scrutiny. That resulted in a quarter in which the cloud grew 19%, up $10 billion over last year to $63 billion. That doesn’t sound too terrible, except when you compare the numbers to last year when the market grew 32%. Clearly we are still in a cost-cutting cycle and it’s having an impact on cloud infrastructure revenue growth, but Synergy Research reports that there are signs we could be coming out of the recent doldrums. Synergy’s chief analyst John Dinsdale says that overall the market remains solid, and we are starting to see a shift in some of the trends that have been contributing to the the downward growth. “There has been some angst about declining cloud growth rates, but the Q1 worldwide market value grew by more than $10 billion compared with the first quarter of 2022. Clearly the relatively weak economy has caused some enterprises to more closely review spending on cloud services, but the market continues to grow despite those challenges,” Dinsdale wrote in a comment to the press. He points out that the Chinese market has returned to growth and exchange rate pressure has started easing, contributing to growth in the EMEA and APAC regions. “The law of large numbers pretty much dictates that growth rates must decline, but in absolute terms the market continues to grow at a healthy rate, driven by the fundamental benefits of cloud adoption,” Dinsdale said. It’s fair to say that most industries would be happy with a growth rate that’s nearly 20% in this economic climate, but the cloud has been dealing with rates in the high 30s until recently, so it feels worse, and as we’ve learned, perception counts. This is especially true for Amazon, where AWS has been the growth engine for the company for more than a decade and it’s suddenly looking at a quarter where the growth plunged into the teens to 16%. Again, for a mature company, that doesn’t feel that horrible, but the cloud revenue numbers continue to trend down from the 20% rate the company saw the prior quarter. Meanwhile, Azure growth continued to drop too. While Microsoft’s cloud arm grew at a higher rate than Amazon at 27%, that was down from 31% the prior quarter. Google Cloud was up 27.5%, slowing from 32% the prior quarter, but turning a profit for the first time.   What impact does all of that have on market share? Well, as it turns out, not that much. Amazon has owned a fairly steady third of the market for years, even as the pie has grown. Microsoft has been gaining slowly but steadily, and Google has reached 10% and so far is holding steady there. The big three account for 65% of the total revenue. For the quarter, AWS continues to have 32% market share, good for over $20 billion for the quarter, Microsoft held steady from the prior quarter at 23%, good for over $14 billion in revenue for the quarter, and with 10% Google Cloud took in over $6 billion. Synergy looks at infrastructure and platform as a service, as well as hosted private clouds, to come up with its market numbers. Nothing goes up forever, but there are signals on the horizon that perhaps the cloud infrastructure market will return to growth. There is certainly still plenty of room, especially with these companies looking at adding data-intensive AI workloads, and with that, the market should stabilize over time."
458,"Amazon to shutter Book Depository, a UK-based online bookseller it acquired in 2011, on April 26",['@psawers'],"April 4, 2023","Amazon is set to shutter Book Depository, an online bookstore and competitor it acquired back in 2011. The news comes hot on the heels of a swath of cutbacks at the internet giant, with two separate rounds of layoffs impacting at least 27,000 people across various divisions, including its highly profitable AWS cloud unit and, indeed, its devices and books businesses. Founded out of Gloucester, the U.K., in 2004, Book Depository (initially called The Book Depository) was a small-scale competitor to Amazon’s online bookselling business, shipping books to readers in more than 100 countries. At the time of the acquisition, some feared that it signaled a tightening of Amazon’s “stranglehold” over the U.K.’s online book trade, a fear that may have had more than a little foundation. However, despite industry protests, the deal ultimately received regulatory approval, with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) affirming at the time that Book Depository wasn’t a true competitor owing to its relative size. In the intervening years, Amazon has done little to integrate Book Depository, from a branding perspective at least. Indeed, there has never been any visible indication on Book Depository’s website that it’s owned by Amazon, an approach that it has taken to other similar acquisitions it has made in the space such as Goodreads, a social reading platform it bought in 2013. First reported by publishing industry trade outlet The Bookseller earlier today (paywalled), Book Depository has now posted a closure announcement on its website, revealing that it will cease to exist after April 26, 2023. Customers will still be able to place orders online until midday (BST) on that day, and the company said it will fulfil all orders and provide support through June 23, 2023. In truth, none of this should really come as much of a surprise given activities elsewhere at Amazon in recent times, particularly with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy previously confirming that its books business would be hit by the layoffs. Elsewhere, Amazon confirmed a few weeks back that it was shuttering esteemed camera review site DPReview, another U.K.-based entity that it had bought initially in 2007. And last year, Amazon revealed it was shuttering dozens of physical retail locations in the U.S. and U.K., including its brick-and-mortar bookstores, while it’s also pulling the plug on some of its cashierless Amazon Go stores. The company is also in the process of winding down its consumer-focused file-storage service Amazon Drive. It’s not clear how many people worked on the Book Depository side of its business, or whether any of them will be redeployed elsewhere. An Amazon spokesperson simply confirmed to TechCrunch that they have “taken the difficult decision to close Book Depository,” without providing any further details."
459,"As another startup bank partner collapses, tech feels the gap","['Christine Hall', 'Mary Ann Azevedo', 'Natasha Mascarenhas']","May 2, 2023","When First Republic Bank was in its final moments, Silicon Valley didn’t convulse with shock or lather itself into a social media tizzy. Instead of panic, which rippled throughout the startup community in March when Silicon Valley Bank signaled trouble, there was widespread malaise. Part of the reason for that may be that we’ve been here before, and part of the reason may be that FRB had a faster resolution than SVB: Earlier this week, FRB was officially put under FDIC receivership so its assets could be sold to a bidder. As startups scrap together new money management plans, fatigued with banking and stressed by the downturn, they’re finding that a gap has been left behind by the collapse of these venture-friendly institutions. Marisa Ricciardi, founder and CEO of marketing agency The Ricciardi Group, wondered if the two bank failures called for the “death of relationship banking for small businesses.” “Now that FR is Chase and SVB essentially doesn’t exist, what good options are there for founders?” Ricciardi asked. “Which bank will [let me] actually have the cell phones of bankers who will answer day or night? Which bank will give a founder a loan to put their kids through school or to buy a house, and understand the value of equity and options, etc.? It’s not just about these two banks: It’s about a new gaping hole in the overall founder and small business ecosystem that no one at present is able to fill. Entrepreneurship will be stifled by this in a meaningful way for a period. It will be interesting to see who stands up as a small business and growth bank.” Hustle Fund’s co-founder and general partner Eric Bahn has used First Republic Bank as the firm’s bank for the past six years. He describes it as “one of those canonical institutions when you’re an emerging manager.” “Just a couple months ago, there were just two options of banks to work with: Silicon Valley Bank or First Republic Bank,” he said. While he is happy that JPMorgan stepped in to buy First Republic, he’s not that happy that one of the world’s largest banks ended up being the buyer. “I think we lost something big here, and my only hope is that JPMorgan respects the brand and the customer service that [FRB] has spent decades to build.” “I was hoping that it’d be PNC,” Bahn said, referring to the Pittsburgh-based bank that was said to be among the bidders for FRB. “I thought that it’d be nice to see another slightly smaller bank win to consolidate and maybe strengthen this position for themselves to compete with the larger banks.”"
460,‘The Witcher’ season 3 will debut this summer in two parts,['@aiishamalik1'],"April 25, 2023","Netflix has announced that the third season of “The Witcher” will premiere on June 29. The streaming service is splitting up the season into two parts, with the second half of the season debuting on July 27. The third season will be particularly notable because it will be last with Henry Cavill playing Geralt. Following this season, the character will be played by Liam Hemsworth. Alongside the release dates, Netflix has also released a new minute-long teaser for the upcoming season. This summer, everything changes. The Witcher Season 3 begins on the 29th of June 🐺⚔️ #thewitcher pic.twitter.com/lQ6VNTwa12 — The Witcher (@witchernetflix) April 25, 2023  “As monarchs, mages and beasts of the Continent compete to capture her, Geralt takes Ciri of Cintra into hiding, determined to protect his newly reunited family against those who threaten to destroy it,” reads Netflix’s summary for the season. “Entrusted with Ciri’s magical training, Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl’s untapped powers; instead, they discover they’ve landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic and treachery. They must fight back, put everything on the line — or risk losing each other forever.” It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time that Netflix has split up a season in two parts. Last summer, the streaming service split into two parts the fourth season of “Stranger Things.” Earlier this year, the company did the same with the fourth season of “You.” Netflix has been known for letting its users binge watch its series by releasing entire seasons at once in the past. Now, the company is rethinking its strategy, likely in the hopes of spreading the buzz around its shows over at least a month, as opposed to a week, which is sometimes the case when users watch an entire season in a weekend. Today’s announcement comes as Netflix revealed last week that its crackdown on password sharing is coming to the U.S. this summer.  "
461,France bans recreational apps like TikTok on government devices,['@romaindillet'],"March 27, 2023","France is the latest country taking steps to ban TikTok from government-managed devices. Stanislas Guerini, the Minister of Public Transformation and Service, and his services issued a statement announcing the move and the reasoning behind this change. But there’s a twist: Instead of simply banning only TikTon, the French government is saying that all recreational apps are now banned from work devices. “For the past few weeks, several European and international partners have adopted measures to limit or prohibit downloading and installing the TikTok application by their public administrations,” the French government wrote. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives banned TikTok on lawmakers’ government-issued mobile devices, as has Canada. The European Commission issued a directive asking all employees to remove TikTok from their work devices as well. In all those instances, government bodies state that they are concerned about data privacy. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a private Chinese company, and these governments believe that user data could be stored and accessed by the Chinese government. TikTok has said several times that the company doesn’t share user data with the Chinese government. The company has tried to reassure European governments by saying that it will set up and run multiple data centers to store local users’ data in Europe in the near future. In addition to this data sovereignty strategy, TikTok is “reducing employee access to European user data; minimising data flows outside of Europe,” wrote Rich Waterworth, TikTok’s general manager operations, Europe. Of course, it means that governments have to trust TikTok’s word, which doesn’t seem to be the case in France. “After an analysis of the stakes, notably security, the government has decided to prohibit from now on the downloading and installation of recreational applications on professional phones provided to public agents,” the Ministry of Public Transformation and Service said. So what is a recreational app exactly? Guerini’s office told the AFP and AP news agencies that some of these apps include TikTok (obviously) as well as Twitter, Instagram, Netflix, Candy Crush and other games, as well as dating apps. It sounds like a broad and loose concept and I hope we’ll get some clarification on the exact scope of the recreational category. We’ve reached out to Guerini’s office and will update this article if we get more details. “Recreational applications do not have a sufficient level of cybersecurity and data protection to be deployed on government equipment. These applications may therefore pose a risk to the data protection of these administrations and their public officials,” the French government wrote. A message has been sent to all ministries. The inter-ministerial digital administration (DINUM) and the cybersecurity agency (ANSSI) will follow up with more specific instructions on the implementation of the ban. There will be one notable exception: If you need to install an app to communicate about your administration’s work, you will be able to do do so. In other words, if you are a social media manager, you will be able to install Twitter, Facebook and, yes, TikTok."
